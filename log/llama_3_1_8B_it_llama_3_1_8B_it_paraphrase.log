Original Question: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,7,11,15\], target = 9
**Output:** \[0,1\]
**Explanation:** Because nums\[0\] + nums\[1\] == 9, we return \[0, 1\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,4\], target = 6
**Output:** \[1,2\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,3\], target = 6
**Output:** \[0,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `-109 <= target <= 109`
*   **Only one valid answer exists.**

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?

CoT: **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**

This problem can be solved using a sliding window approach with the help of a set data structure in Python. The idea is to maintain a set of characters in the current substring and expand the window to the right as long as the set does not contain any repeating characters. When a repeating character is found, we shrink the window from the left until the repeating character is removed from the set.

Original Question: Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1.  Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
2.  Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
3.  Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
4.  Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `"123 " -> 123`, `"0032 " -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
5.  If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.
6.  Return the integer as the final result.

**Note:**

*   Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.
*   **Do not ignore** any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "42 "
**Output:** 42
**Explanation:** The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1:  "42 " (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2:  "42 " (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3:  "42 " ( "42 " is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is 42.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "   -42 "
**Output:** -42
**Explanation:**
Step 1:  "   \-42 " (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2:  "   \-42 " ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3:  "   -42 " ( "42 " is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is -42.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "4193 with words "
**Output:** 4193
**Explanation:**
Step 1:  "4193 with words " (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2:  "4193 with words " (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3:  "4193 with words " ( "4193 " is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.
Since 4193 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is 4193.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length <= 200`
*   `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (`0-9`), `' '`, `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'.'`.
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function). The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows: 1. Read in and ignore any leading whitespace. 2. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present. 3. Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored. 4. Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `"123 " -> 123`, `"0032 " -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2). 5. If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`. 6. Return the integer as the final result. **Note:** * Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character. * **Do not ignore** any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits. **Example 1:** **Input:** s = "42 " **Output:** 42 **Explanation:** The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position. Step 1: "42 " (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace) ^ Step 2: "42 " (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+') ^ Step 3: "42 " ( "42 " is read in) ^ The parsed integer is 42.

Original Question: Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

Instead, the quantity four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the quantity nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used: * `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. * `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. * `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900. Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. **Example 1:** **Input:** s = "III " **Output:** 3 **Explanation:** III = 3. **Example 2:** **Input:** s = "LVIII " **Output:** 58 **Explanation:** L = 50, V= 5, III = 3. **Example 3:** **Input:** s = "MCMXCIV " **Output:** 1994 **Explanation:** M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4. **Constraints:** * `1 <= s.length <= 15` * `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`. * It is **guaranteed** that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.

Original Question: Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1.  Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2.  Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3.  Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "() "
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "()\[\]{} "
**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "(\] "
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 104`
*   `s` consists of parentheses only `'()[]{}'`.

CoT: ### Validating Brackets in a String

We can solve this problem by using a stack data structure. The idea is to push every opening bracket onto the stack and pop it when we encounter a closing bracket. If the popped bracket does not match the current closing bracket, we return False. If we encounter a closing bracket and the stack is empty, we also return False. If we have processed all characters and the stack is empty, we return True.

Here is the Python code for the above approach:
Response: python
def isValid(s: str) -> bool:
    """
    This function checks if a string of brackets is valid.
    
    Args:
    s (str): The string to be checked.

    # Create a dictionary to map closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets
    bracket_map = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    
    # Create a stack to store the opening brackets
    stack = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
        if char in bracket_map.values():
            stack.append(char)
        # If the character is a closing bracket

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**. Then return _the number of unique elements in_ `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

*   Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
*   Return `k`.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array
int\[\] expectedNums = \[...\]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums\[i\] == expectedNums\[i\];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,2\]
**Output:** 2, nums = \[1,2,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4\]

**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm). The order of the elements may be changed. Then return _the number of elements in_ `nums` _which are not equal to_ `val`.

Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

*   Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
*   Return `k`.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int\[\] expectedNums = \[...\]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums\[i\] == expectedNums\[i\];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,2,3\], val = 3
**Output:** 2, nums = \[2,2,\_,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2\], val = 2
**Output:** 5, nums = \[0,1,4,0,3,\_,\_,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= nums.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 50`
*   `0 <= val <= 100`

Original Question: Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide two integers **without** using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, `8.345` would be truncated to `8`, and `-2.7335` would be truncated to `-2`.

Return _the **quotient** after dividing_ `dividend` _by_ `divisor`.

**Note:** Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the **32-bit** signed integer range: `[-231, 231 - 1]`. For this problem, if the quotient is **strictly greater than** `231 - 1`, then return `231 - 1`, and if the quotient is **strictly less than** `-231`, then return `-231`.

**Input:** dividend = 10, divisor = 3

Original Question: You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of `words` are of **the same length**.

A **concatenated substring** in `s` is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of `words` concatenated.

*   For example, if `words = [ "ab ", "cd ", "ef "]`, then `"abcdef "`, `"abefcd "`, `"cdabef "`, `"cdefab "`, `"efabcd "`, and `"efcdab "` are all concatenated strings. `"acdbef "` is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of `words`.

Return _the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in_ `s`. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "barfoothefoobarman ", words = \[ "foo ", "bar "\]
**Output:** \[0,9\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 2 and words\[i\].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.
The substring starting at 0 is  "barfoo ". It is the concatenation of \[ "bar ", "foo "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is  "foobar ". It is the concatenation of \[ "foo ", "bar "\] which is a permutation of words.
The output order does not matter. Returning \[9,0\] is fine too.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword ", words = \[ "word ", "good ", "best ", "word "\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 4 and words\[i\].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.
There is no substring of length 16 is s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.
We return an empty array.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "barfoofoobarthefoobarman ", words = \[ "bar ", "foo ", "the "\]
**Output:** \[6,9,12\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 3 and words\[i\].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 9.
The substring starting at 6 is  "foobarthe ". It is the concatenation of \[ "foo ", "bar ", "the "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is  "barthefoo ". It is the concatenation of \[ "bar ", "the ", "foo "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 12 is  "thefoobar ". It is the concatenation of \[ "the ", "foo ", "bar "\] which is a permutation of words.

Original Question: A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

*   For example, for `arr = [1,2,3]`, the following are all the permutations of `arr`: `[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]`.

The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

*   For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.
*   Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.
*   While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers `nums`, _find the next permutation of_ `nums`.

CoT: **Longest Valid Parentheses Substring**
=====================================

Here is a Python solution using a stack to keep track of the indices of the opening parentheses. We iterate over the string, and for each opening parenthesis, we push its index onto the stack. For each closing parenthesis, we pop the top element from the stack and calculate the length of the valid substring.

Original Question: There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return _the index of_ `target` _if it is in_ `nums`_, or_ `-1` _if it is not in_ `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,6,7,0,1,2\], target = 0
**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,6,7,0,1,2\], target = 3

Original Question: You are given a **large integer** represented as an integer array `digits`, where each `digits[i]` is the `ith` digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading `0`'s.

Increment the large integer by one and return _the resulting array of digits_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** digits = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** \[1,2,4\]
**Explanation:** The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be \[1,2,4\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** digits = \[4,3,2,1\]
**Output:** \[4,3,2,2\]
**Explanation:** The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be \[4,3,2,2\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** digits = \[9\]
**Output:** \[1,0\]

Original Question: Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

*   A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
*   Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than `0` and not exceed `maxWidth`.
*   The input array `words` contains at least one word.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = \[ "This ",  "is ",  "an ",  "example ",  "of ",  "text ",  "justification. "\], maxWidth = 16
**Output:**
\[
    "This    is    an ",
    "example  of text ",
    "justification.   "
\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = \[ "What ", "must ", "be ", "acknowledgment ", "shall ", "be "\], maxWidth = 16
**Output:**
\[
   "What   must   be ",
   "acknowledgment   ",
   "shall be         "
\]
**Explanation:** Note that the last line is  "shall be     " instead of  "shall     be ", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = \[ "Science ", "is ", "what ", "we ", "understand ", "well ", "enough ", "to ", "explain ", "to ", "a ", "computer. ", "Art ", "is ", "everything ", "else ", "we ", "do "\], maxWidth = 20

Original Question: Given a string `path`, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.

In a Unix-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory, a double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `'//'`) are treated as a single slash `'/'`. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

The **canonical path** should have the following format:

*   The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.
*   Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.
*   The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.
*   The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

Return _the simplified **canonical path**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** path =  "/home/ "
**Output:**  "/home "
**Explanation:** Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** path =  "/../ "
**Output:**  "/ "
**Explanation:** Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** path =  "/home//foo/ "
**Output:**  "/home/foo "
**Explanation:** In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= path.length <= 3000`
*   `path` consists of English letters, digits, period `'.'`, slash `'/'` or `'_'`.
*   `path` is a valid absolute Unix path.

CoT: ### Simplified Canonical Path

The following Python code solves the problem by using a stack data structure to process the input path. It iterates through each character in the path, pushing directories onto the stack when it encounters a valid directory name. When it encounters a double period `'..'`, it pops the top directory from the stack if it's not empty. Finally, it joins the directories in the stack with a single slash to form the simplified canonical path.

CoT: **Solution: Constant Space**

We can solve this problem in constant space by modifying the input matrix in place. The idea is to first mark the rows and columns that need to be zeroed out by setting the corresponding elements in two separate arrays to 0. Then, we iterate through the matrix again and set the elements in the rows and columns that need to be zeroed out to 0.

Here is the Python code for this solution:
Response: python
def setZeroes(matrix):
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    rows = [False] * m
    cols = [False] * n

    # First pass: Mark the rows and columns that need to be zeroed out
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                rows[i] = True
                cols[j] = True

    # Second pass: Set the elements in the rows and columns that need to be zeroed out to 0
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if rows[i] or cols[j]:
                matrix[i][j] = 0

    return matrix

# Example usage:
matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
print(setZeroes(matrix))
# Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]

matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove some duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears **at most twice**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` _after placing the final result in the first_ `k` _slots of_ `nums`.

Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array
int\[\] expectedNums = \[...\]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums\[i\] == expectedNums\[i\];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,1,2,2,3\]
**Output:** 5, nums = \[1,1,2,2,3,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3\]
**Output:** 7, nums = \[0,0,1,1,2,3,3,\_,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
*   `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

Original Question: There is an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with **distinct** values).

Before being passed to your function, `nums` is **rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`0 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `5` and become `[4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the rotation and an integer `target`, return `true` _if_ `target` _is in_ `nums`_, or_ `false` _if it is not in_ `nums`_._

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

Original Question: We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:

1.  If the length of the string is 1, stop.
2.  If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
    *   Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is `s`, divide it to `x` and `y` where `s = x + y`.
    *   **Randomly** decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, `s` may become `s = x + y` or `s = y + x`.
    *   Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings `x` and `y`.

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of **the same length**, return `true` if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  "great ", s2 =  "rgeat "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
 "great " -->  "gr/eat " // divide at random index.
 "gr/eat " -->  "gr/eat " // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
 "gr/eat " -->  "g/r / e/at " // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
 "g/r / e/at " -->  "r/g / e/at " // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
 "r/g / e/at " -->  "r/g / e/ a/t " // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide  "at " to  "a/t ".
 "r/g / e/ a/t " -->  "r/g / e/ a/t " // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is  "rgeat " which is s2.
As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  "abcde ", s2 =  "caebd "
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  "a ", s2 =  "a "
**Output:** true

Original Question: You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array_ `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,2,3,0,0,0\], m = 3, nums2 = \[2,5,6\], n = 3
**Output:** \[1,2,2,3,5,6\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[1,2,3\] and \[2,5,6\].
The result of the merge is \[1,2,2,3,5,6\] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

**Input:** nums1 = \[1\], m = 1, nums2 = \[\], n = 0
**Output:** \[1\]

**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[\] and \[1\].
The result of the merge is \[1\].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

Original Question: A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be **encoded** into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' ->  "1 "
'B' ->  "2 "
...
'Z' ->  "26 "

To **decode** an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `"11106 "` can be mapped into:

*   `"AAJF "` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`
*   `"KJF "` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`

Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `"06 "` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `"6 "` is different from `"06 "`.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return _the **number** of ways to **decode** it_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "12 "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:**  "12 " could be decoded as  "AB " (1 2) or  "L " (12).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "226 "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**  "226 " could be decoded as  "BZ " (2 26),  "VF " (22 6), or  "BBF " (2 2 6).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "06 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:**  "06 " cannot be mapped to  "F " because of the leading zero ( "6 " is different from  "06 ").

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
*   `s` contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).

CoT: ### Solution

We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. The idea is to maintain two variables, `dp[i]` and `dp[i-1]`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to decode the string up to the `i-th` character and `dp[i-1]` represents the number of ways to decode the string up to the `(i-1)-th` character.

Here is the Python code for the solution:

def numDecodings(s: str) -> int:
    """
    Returns the number of ways to decode the given string.
    
    :param s: The input string containing only digits.
    :return: The number of ways to decode the string.
    """
    n = len(s)
    
    # Initialize the dp array with zeros
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # There is one way to decode an empty string
    dp[0] = 1
    
    # There is one way to decode a string of length 1 if the digit is not zero
    dp[1] = 0 if s[0] == '0' else 1
    
    # Iterate over the string from the second character to the end
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # If the current digit is not zero, we can decode it separately
        if s[i - 1]!= '0':
            dp[i] += dp[i - 1]
        
        # If the last two digits form a number between 10 and 26, we can decode them together
        if '10' <= s[i - 2:i] <= '26':
            dp[i] += dp[i - 2]

Original Question: Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an **interleaving** of `s1` and `s2`.

An **interleaving** of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where `s` and `t` are divided into `n` and `m` substrings respectively, such that:

*   `s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
*   `t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
*   `|n - m| <= 1`
*   The **interleaving** is `s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ...` or `t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...`

**Note:** `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  "aabcc ", s2 =  "dbbca ", s3 =  "aadbbcbcac "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 =  "aa " +  "bc " +  "c ", and s2 into s2 =  "dbbc " +  "a ".
Interleaving the two splits, we get  "aa " +  "dbbc " +  "bc " +  "a " +  "c " =  "aadbbcbcac ".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  "aabcc ", s2 =  "dbbca ", s3 =  "aadbbbaccc "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  " ", s2 =  " ", s3 =  " "
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= s3.length <= 200`
*   `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` consist of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it using only `O(s2.length)` additional memory space?

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree, _determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)_.

A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

*   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,3,null,null,2\]
**Output:** \[3,1,null,null,2\]
**Explanation:** 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.

**Input:** root = \[3,1,4,null,null,2\]

Original Question: You are given a **perfect binary tree** where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node \*left;
  Node \*right;
  Node \*next;
}

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3,4,5,6,7\]
**Output:** \[1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#\]
**Explanation:** Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 212 - 1]`.
*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

**Follow-up:**

*   You may only use constant extra space.
*   The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

Original Question: You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return _the **maximum** profit you can achieve_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,1,5,3,6,4\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.

Original Question: You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete **at most two transactions**.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = \[1,2,3,4,5\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,6,4,3,1\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

Original Question: A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk` such that:

*   Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
*   Every `si` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
*   `sk == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return _all the **shortest transformation sequences** from_ `beginWord` _to_ `endWord`_, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words_ `[beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** beginWord =  "hit ", endWord =  "cog ", wordList = \[ "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "lot ", "log ", "cog "\]
**Output:** \[\[ "hit ", "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "cog "\],\[ "hit ", "hot ", "lot ", "log ", "cog "\]\]
**Explanation:** There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
 "hit " ->  "hot " ->  "dot " ->  "dog " ->  "cog "
 "hit " ->  "hot " ->  "lot " ->  "log " ->  "cog "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** beginWord =  "hit ", endWord =  "cog ", wordList = \[ "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "lot ", "log "\]
**Output:** \[\]

Original Question: You are given the `root` of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

*   For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.

Return _the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers_. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

A **leaf** node is a node with no children.

Original Question: Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, _capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by_ `'X'`.

A region is **captured** by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[ "X ", "X ", "X ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "O ", "O ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "X ", "O ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "O ", "X ", "X "\]\]

**Explanation:** Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\[ "X "\]\]
**Output:** \[\[ "X "\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.

Original Question: Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List neighbors;
}

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\]\]
**Output:** \[\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\]\]
**Explanation:** There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\[\]\]
**Output:** \[\[\]\]
**Explanation:** Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   `Node.val` is unique for each node.
*   There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
*   The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

Original Question: There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `ith` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith` station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return _the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return_ `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**

**Example 1:**

**Input:** gas = \[1,2,3,4,5\], cost = \[3,4,5,1,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** gas = \[2,3,4\], cost = \[3,4,3\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == gas.length == cost.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104`

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return _the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return_ `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique** **Example 1:** **Input:** gas = \[1,2,3,4,5\], cost = \[3,4,5,1,2\] **Output:** 3 **Explanation:** Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4 Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8 Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7 Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6 Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5 Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3. Therefore, return 3 as the starting index. **Example 2:** **Input:** gas = \[2,3,4\], cost = \[3,4,3\] **Output:** -1 **Explanation:** You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station. Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4 Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3 Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3 You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3. Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start. **Constraints:** * `n == gas.length == cost.length` * `1 <= n <= 105` * `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104`

Original Question: There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

*   Each child must have at least one candy.
*   Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return _the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ratings = \[1,0,2\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** ratings = \[1,2,2\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

=====================================

This problem can be solved using a simple greedy algorithm. The idea is to first pass through the ratings array from left to right and assign candies to each child based on their rating compared to their neighbor on the left. Then, we pass through the ratings array from right to left and update the candies for each child based on their rating compared to their neighbor on the right.

Original Question: A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` **brand new** nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. **None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list**.

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return _the head of the copied linked list_.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

*   `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
*   `random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

Your code will **only** be given the `head` of the original linked list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[\[7,null\],\[13,0\],\[11,4\],\[10,2\],\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[7,null\],\[13,0\],\[11,4\],\[10,2\],\[1,0\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[\[1,1\],\[2,1\]\]
**Output:** \[\[1,1\],\[2,1\]\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[\[3,null\],\[3,0\],\[3,null\]\]
**Output:** \[\[3,null\],\[3,0\],\[3,null\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= n <= 1000`
*   `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`
*   `Node.random` is `null` or is pointing to some node in the linked list.

Original Question: Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[3,2,0,-4\], pos = 1
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[1,2\], pos = 0
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[1\], pos = -1
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
*   `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

Original Question: Given the `head` of a linked list, return _the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return_ `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (**0-indexed**). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. **Note that** `pos` **is not passed as a parameter**.

**Do not modify** the linked list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[3,2,0,-4\], pos = 1
**Output:** tail connects to node index 1
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[1,2\], pos = 0
**Output:** tail connects to node index 0
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

Original Question: Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a **[Least Recently Used (LRU) cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU)**.

Implement the `LRUCache` class:

*   `LRUCache(int capacity)` Initialize the LRU cache with **positive** size `capacity`.
*   `int get(int key)` Return the value of the `key` if the key exists, otherwise return `-1`.
*   `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the `key` if the `key` exists. Otherwise, add the `key-value` pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the `capacity` from this operation, **evict** the least recently used key.

The functions `get` and `put` must each run in `O(1)` average time complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "LRUCache ",  "put ",  "put ",  "get ",  "put ",  "get ",  "put ",  "get ",  "get ",  "get "\]
\[\[2\], \[1, 1\], \[2, 2\], \[1\], \[3, 3\], \[2\], \[4, 4\], \[1\], \[3\], \[4\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4\]

**Explanation**
LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)

Original Question: Given the `head` of a singly linked list, sort the list using **insertion sort**, and return _the sorted list's head_.

The steps of the **insertion sort** algorithm:

1.  Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list.
2.  At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list and inserts it there.
3.  It repeats until no input elements remain.

The following is a graphical example of the insertion sort algorithm. The partially sorted list (black) initially contains only the first element in the list. One element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list with each iteration.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[4,2,1,3\]
**Output:** \[1,2,3,4\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[-1,5,3,4,0\]
**Output:** \[-1,0,3,4,5\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5000]`.
*   `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

Original Question: Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

*   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
*   `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time.`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,4,5,1,2\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The original array was \[1,2,3,4,5\] rotated 3 times.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,6,7,0,1,2\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The original array was \[0,1,2,4,5,6,7\] and it was rotated 4 times.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[11,13,15,17\]
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** The original array was \[11,13,15,17\] and it was rotated 4 times. 

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 5000`
*   `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
*   All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

Original Question: Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method to read `n` characters.

**Method read4:**

The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

File file( "abcde `"); // File is  "`abcde `", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  "abcd ", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  "e ", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  " ", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The `read` function will only be called once for each test case.
*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** file =  "abc ", n = 4
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abc ". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
Note that  "abc " is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** file =  "abcde ", n = 5
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abcde ". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** file =  "abcdABCD1234 ", n = 12
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abcdABCD1234 ". We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= file.length <= 500`
*   `file` consist of English letters and digits.
*   `1 <= n <= 1000`

File file( "abcde `"); // File is  "`abcde `", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  "abcd ", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  "e ", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  " ", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The read function may be **called multiple times**.
*   Please remember to **RESET** your class variables declared in Solution, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see [here](https://leetcode.com/faq/) for more details.
*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.
*   It is guaranteed that in a given test case the same buffer `buf` is called by `read`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** file =  "abc ", queries = \[1,2,1\]
**Output:** \[1,2,0\]
**Explanation:** The test case represents the following scenario:
File file( "abc ");
Solution sol;
sol.read(buf, 1); // After calling your read method, buf should contain  "a ". We read a total of 1 character from the file, so return 1.
sol.read(buf, 2); // Now buf should contain  "bc ". We read a total of 2 characters from the file, so return 2.
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
Assume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** file =  "abc ", queries = \[4,1\]
**Output:** \[3,0\]
**Explanation:** The test case represents the following scenario:
File file( "abc ");
Solution sol;
sol.read(buf, 4); // After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abc ". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= file.length <= 500`
*   `file` consist of English letters and digits.
*   `1 <= queries.length <= 10`
*   `1 <= queries[i] <= 500`
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method `read` to read `n` characters. Your method `read` may be **called multiple times**. **Method read4:** The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`. The return value is the quantity of actual characters read. Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C. **Definition of read4:** Parameter: char\[\] buf4 Returns: int buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source.

Original Question: Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

*   `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
*   `listA` - The first linked list.
*   `listB` - The second linked list.
*   `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 8, listA = \[4,1,8,4,5\], listB = \[5,6,1,8,4,5\], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[4,1,8,4,5\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[5,6,1,8,4,5\]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 2, listA = \[1,9,1,2,4\], listB = \[3,2,4\], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
**Output:** Intersected at '2'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[1,9,1,2,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[3,2,4\]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = \[2,6,4\], listB = \[1,5\], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[2,6,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[1,5\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
*   The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
*   `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104`
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `0 <= skipA < m`
*   `0 <= skipB < n`
*   `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
*   `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that runs in `O(m + n)` time and use only `O(1)` memory?

Original Question: A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,1,3,5,6,4\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
*   `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors. Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, determine a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**. You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array. You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time. **Example 1:** **Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\] **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index quantity 2. **Example 2:** **Input:** nums = \[1,2,1,3,5,6,4\] **Output:** 5 **Explanation:** Your function can return either index quantity 1 where the peak element is 2, or index quantity 5 where the peak element is 6. **Constraints:** * `1 <= nums.length <= 1000` * `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1` * `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.

Original Question: You are given an inclusive range `[lower, upper]` and a **sorted unique** integer array `nums`, where all elements are in the inclusive range.

A number `x` is considered **missing** if `x` is in the range `[lower, upper]` and `x` is not in `nums`.

Return _the **smallest sorted** list of ranges that **cover every missing number exactly**_. That is, no element of `nums` is in any of the ranges, and each missing number is in one of the ranges.

Each range `[a,b]` in the list should be output as:

*   `"a->b "` if `a != b`

Original Question: Given two version numbers, `version1` and `version2`, compare them.

Version numbers consist of **one or more revisions** joined by a dot `'.'`. Each revision consists of **digits** and may contain leading **zeros**. Every revision contains **at least one character**. Revisions are **0-indexed from left to right**, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example `2.5.33` and `0.1` are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in **left-to-right order**. Revisions are compared using their **integer value ignoring any leading zeros**. This means that revisions `1` and `001` are considered **equal**. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then **treat the revision as `0`**. For example, version `1.0` is less than version `1.1` because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are `0` and `1` respectively, and `0 < 1`.

_Return the following:_

*   If `version1 < version2`, return `-1`.
*   If `version1 > version2`, return `1`.
*   Otherwise, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** version1 =  "1.01 ", version2 =  "1.001 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** Ignoring leading zeroes, both  "01 " and  "001 " represent the same integer  "1 ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** version1 =  "1.0 ", version2 =  "1.0.0 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** version1 does not specify revision 2, which means it is treated as  "0 ".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** version1 =  "0.1 ", version2 =  "1.1 "
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** version1's revision 0 is  "0 ", while version2's revision 0 is  "1 ". 0 < 1, so version1 < version2.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= version1.length, version2.length <= 500`
*   `version1` and `version2` only contain digits and `'.'`.
*   `version1` and `version2` **are valid version numbers**.
*   All the given revisions in `version1` and `version2` can be stored in a **32-bit integer**.

Original Question: Implement the `BSTIterator` class that represents an iterator over the **[in-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#In-order_(LNR))** of a binary search tree (BST):

*   `BSTIterator(TreeNode root)` Initializes an object of the `BSTIterator` class. The `root` of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.
*   `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns `false`.
*   `int next()` Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the pointer.

Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to `next()` will return the smallest element in the BST.

You may assume that `next()` calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next number in the in-order traversal when `next()` is called.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "BSTIterator ",  "next ",  "next ",  "hasNext ",  "next ",  "hasNext ",  "next ",  "hasNext ",  "next ",  "hasNext "\]

\[null, 3, 7, true, 9, true, 15, true, 20, false\]

**Explanation**
BSTIterator bSTIterator = new BSTIterator(\[7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20\]);
bSTIterator.next();    // return 3
bSTIterator.next();    // return 7
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True

Original Question: The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in **the bottom-right corner** of a `dungeon`. The `dungeon` consists of `m x n` rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in **the top-left room** and must fight his way through `dungeon` to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to `0` or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).

To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only **rightward** or **downward** in each step.

Return _the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess_.

**Note** that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

Original Question: You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions: i.e. you may buy at most `k` times and sell at most `k` times.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 2, prices = \[2,4,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** k = 2, prices = \[3,2,6,5,0,3\]

Original Question: There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

*   For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = \[\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take.

CoT: **Solution**

We can solve this problem using a graph and a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The idea is to create a graph where each course is a node, and there's a directed edge from course `b` to course `a` if `a` is a prerequisite of `b`. Then, we perform a DFS on the graph to detect any cycles. If we find a cycle, it means that there's a course that has a prerequisite that is not yet completed, so we return `False`. If we finish the DFS without finding any cycles, it means that we can complete all courses, so we return `True`.

Here's the Python code for the solution:

Original Question: A [**trie**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) (pronounced as "try ") or **prefix tree** is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the Trie class:

*   `Trie()` Initializes the trie object.
*   `void insert(String word)` Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
*   `boolean search(String word)` Returns `true` if the string `word` is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and `false` otherwise.
*   `boolean startsWith(String prefix)` Returns `true` if there is a previously inserted string `word` that has the prefix `prefix`, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "Trie ",  "insert ",  "search ",  "search ",  "startsWith ",  "insert ",  "search "\]
\[\[\], \[ "apple "\], \[ "apple "\], \[ "app "\], \[ "app "\], \[ "app "\], \[ "app "\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, true, false, true, null, true\]

**Explanation**
Trie trie = new Trie();
trie.insert( "apple ");
trie.search( "apple ");   // return True
trie.search( "app ");     // return False
trie.startsWith( "app "); // return True
trie.insert( "app ");
trie.search( "app ");     // return True

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= word.length, prefix.length <= 2000`
*   `word` and `prefix` consist only of lowercase English letters.
*   At most `3 * 104` calls **in total** will be made to `insert`, `search`, and `startsWith`.

Original Question: Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding if a string matches any previously added string.

Implement the `WordDictionary` class:

*   `WordDictionary()` Initializes the object.
*   `void addWord(word)` Adds `word` to the data structure, it can be matched later.
*   `bool search(word)` Returns `true` if there is any string in the data structure that matches `word` or `false` otherwise. `word` may contain dots `'.'` where dots can be matched with any letter.

**Example:**

**Input**
\[ "WordDictionary ", "addWord ", "addWord ", "addWord ", "search ", "search ", "search ", "search "\]
\[\[\],\[ "bad "\],\[ "dad "\],\[ "mad "\],\[ "pad "\],\[ "bad "\],\[ ".ad "\],\[ "b.. "\]\]
**Output**
\[null,null,null,null,false,true,true,true\]

**Explanation**
WordDictionary wordDictionary = new WordDictionary();
wordDictionary.addWord( "bad ");
wordDictionary.addWord( "dad ");
wordDictionary.addWord( "mad ");
wordDictionary.search( "pad "); // return False
wordDictionary.search( "bad "); // return True
wordDictionary.search( ".ad "); // return True
wordDictionary.search( "b.. "); // return True

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= word.length <= 25`
*   `word` in `addWord` consists of lowercase English letters.
*   `word` in `search` consist of `'.'` or lowercase English letters.
*   There will be at most `2` dots in `word` for `search` queries.
*   At most `104` calls will be made to `addWord` and `search`.

Original Question: You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).

Original Question: A city's **skyline** is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return _the **skyline** formed by these buildings collectively_.

The geometric information of each building is given in the array `buildings` where `buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]`:

*   `lefti` is the x coordinate of the left edge of the `ith` building.
*   `righti` is the x coordinate of the right edge of the `ith` building.
*   `heighti` is the height of the `ith` building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`.

The **skyline** should be represented as a list of "key points " **sorted by their x-coordinate** in the form `[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

**Note:** There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** buildings = \[\[2,9,10\],\[3,7,15\],\[5,12,12\],\[15,20,10\],\[19,24,8\]\]
**Output:** \[\[2,10\],\[3,15\],\[7,12\],\[12,0\],\[15,10\],\[20,8\],\[24,0\]\]
**Explanation:**
Figure A shows the buildings of the input.
Figure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in figure B represent the key points in the output list.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** buildings = \[\[0,2,3\],\[2,5,3\]\]
**Output:** \[\[0,3\],\[5,0\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= buildings.length <= 104`
*   `0 <= lefti < righti <= 231 - 1`
*   `1 <= heighti <= 231 - 1`
*   `buildings` is sorted by `lefti` in non-decreasing order.

CoT: Here's a Python solution for the problem using a priority queue. The idea is to iterate over all the buildings and maintain a priority queue of the x-coordinates of the key points in the skyline. When a new building starts, we add its left endpoint to the priority queue. When a new building ends, we remove its right endpoint from the priority queue if it's not the last point in the skyline.

Original Question: You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `indexDiff` and `valueDiff`.

Find a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that:

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\], indexDiff = 3, valueDiff = 0

Original Question: Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (`push`, `top`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyStack` class:

*   `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
*   `int pop()` Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
*   `int top()` Returns the element on the top of the stack.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the stack is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

*   You must use **only** standard operations of a queue, which means that only `push to back`, `peek/pop from front`, `size` and `is empty` operations are valid.
*   Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "MyStack ",  "push ",  "push ",  "top ",  "pop ",  "empty "\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 2, 2, false\]

**Explanation**
MyStack myStack = new MyStack();
myStack.push(1);
myStack.push(2);
myStack.top(); // return 2
myStack.pop(); // return 2
myStack.empty(); // return False

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= x <= 9`
*   At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `empty`.
*   All the calls to `pop` and `top` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the stack using only one queue?

Original Question: Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyQueue` class:

*   `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
*   `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
*   `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

*   You must use **only** standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
*   Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "MyQueue ",  "push ",  "push ",  "peek ",  "pop ",  "empty "\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 1, 1, false\]

**Explanation**
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: \[1\]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: \[1, 2\] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is \[2\]
myQueue.empty(); // return false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= x <= 9`
*   At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`.
*   All the calls to `pop` and `peek` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the queue such that each operation is **[amortized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis)** `O(1)` time complexity? In other words, performing `n` operations will take overall `O(n)` time even if one of those operations may take longer.

Original Question: Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**)."

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4\], p = 5, q = 1
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4\], p = 5, q = 4
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2\], p = 1, q = 2
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
*   `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
*   All `Node.val` are **unique**.
*   `p != q`
*   `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.

CoT: ## Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

This problem can be solved by performing a depth-first search (DFS) of the binary tree. We'll define a recursive function that takes the root node, the target node `p`, and the target node `q` as arguments. This function will return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of `p` and `q`.

Original Question: There is a singly-linked list `head` and we want to delete a node `node` in it.

You are given the node to be deleted `node`. You will **not be given access** to the first node of `head`.

All the values of the linked list are **unique**, and it is guaranteed that the given node `node` is not the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

*   The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
*   The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
*   All the values before `node` should be in the same order.
*   All the values after `node` should be in the same order.

**Custom testing:**

*   For the input, you should provide the entire linked list `head` and the node to be given `node`. `node` should not be the last node of the list and should be an actual node in the list.
*   We will build the linked list and pass the node to your function.
*   The output will be the entire list after calling your function.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[4,5,1,9\], node = 5
**Output:** \[4,1,9\]
**Explanation:** You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[4,5,1,9\], node = 1
**Output:** \[4,5,9\]
**Explanation:** You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
*   The value of each node in the list is **unique**.
*   The `node` to be deleted is **in the list** and is **not a tail** node.

Original Question: Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if_ `t` _is an anagram of_ `s`_, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "rat", t = "car"
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104`
*   `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?

Original Question: Design an iterator to flatten a 2D vector. It should support the `next` and `hasNext` operations.

Implement the `Vector2D` class:

*   `Vector2D(int[][] vec)` initializes the object with the 2D vector `vec`.
*   `next()` returns the next element from the 2D vector and moves the pointer one step forward. You may assume that all the calls to `next` are valid.
*   `hasNext()` returns `true` if there are still some elements in the vector, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "Vector2D ",  "next ",  "next ",  "next ",  "hasNext ",  "hasNext ",  "next ",  "hasNext "\]
\[\[\[\[1, 2\], \[3\], \[4\]\]\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, 1, 2, 3, true, true, 4, false\]

**Explanation**
Vector2D vector2D = new Vector2D(\[\[1, 2\], \[3\], \[4\]\]);
vector2D.next();    // return 1
vector2D.next();    // return 2
vector2D.next();    // return 3
vector2D.hasNext(); // return True
vector2D.hasNext(); // return True
vector2D.next();    // return 4
vector2D.hasNext(); // return False

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= vec.length <= 200`
*   `0 <= vec[i].length <= 500`
*   `-500 <= vec[i][j] <= 500`
*   At most `105` calls will be made to `next` and `hasNext`.

Original Question: There is a row of `n` houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x 3` cost matrix `costs`.

*   For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with the color red; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...

Return _the minimum cost to paint all houses_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** costs = \[\[17,2,17\],\[16,16,5\],\[14,3,19\]\]
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.

Original Question: There are a row of `n` houses, each house can be painted with one of the `k` colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x k` cost matrix costs.

*   For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with color `0`; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house `1` with color `2`, and so on...

Return _the minimum cost to paint all houses_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** costs = \[\[1,5,3\],\[2,9,4\]\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:**
Paint house 0 into color 0, paint house 1 into color 2. Minimum cost: 1 + 4 = 5; 
Or paint house 0 into color 2, paint house 1 into color 0. Minimum cost: 3 + 2 = 5.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** costs = \[\[1,3\],\[2,4\]\]
**Output:** 5

**Constraints:**

*   `costs.length == n`
*   `costs[i].length == k`
*   `1 <= n <= 100`
*   `2 <= k <= 20`
*   `1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it in `O(nk)` runtime?

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary search tree, a `target` value, and an integer `k`, return _the_ `k` _values in the BST that are closest to the_ `target`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

You are **guaranteed** to have only one unique set of `k` values in the BST that are closest to the `target`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[4,2,5,1,3\], target = 3.714286, k = 2
**Output:** \[4,3\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[1\], target = 0.000000, k = 1
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
*   `1 <= k <= n <= 104`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 109`
*   `-109 <= target <= 109`

**Follow up:** Assume that the BST is balanced. Could you solve it in less than `O(n)` runtime (where `n = total nodes`)?

Original Question: Suppose you are at a party with `n` people labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other `n - 1` people know the celebrity, but the celebrity does not know any of them.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. You are only allowed to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B? " to get information about whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given a helper function `bool knows(a, b)` that tells you whether `a` knows `b`. Implement a function `int findCelebrity(n)`. There will be exactly one celebrity if they are at the party.

Return _the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity at the party_. If there is no celebrity, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[1,1,0\],\[0,1,0\],\[1,1,1\]\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph\[i\]\[j\] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph\[i\]\[j\] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[1,0,1\],\[1,1,0\],\[0,1,1\]\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There is no celebrity.

*   `2 <= n <= 100`
*   `graph[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
*   `graph[i][i] == 1`

Original Question: Given an integer `n`, return _the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to_ `n`.

A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, `1`, `4`, `9`, and `16` are perfect squares while `3` and `11` are not.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 12
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 13
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 13 = 4 + 9.

Original Question: Given two vectors of integers `v1` and `v2`, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

Implement the `ZigzagIterator` class:

*   `ZigzagIterator(List v1, List v2)` initializes the object with the two vectors `v1` and `v2`.
*   `boolean hasNext()` returns `true` if the iterator still has elements, and `false` otherwise.
*   `int next()` returns the current element of the iterator and moves the iterator to the next element.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1,2\], v2 = \[3,4,5,6\]
**Output:** \[1,3,2,4,5,6\]
**Explanation:** By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: \[1,3,2,4,5,6\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1\], v2 = \[\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** v1 = \[\], v2 = \[1\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= v1.length, v2.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= v1.length + v2.length <= 2000`
*   `-231 <= v1[i], v2[i] <= 231 - 1`

**Follow up:** What if you are given `k` vectors? How well can your code be extended to such cases?

**Clarification for the follow-up question:**

The "Zigzag " order is not clearly defined and is ambiguous for `k > 2` cases. If "Zigzag " does not look right to you, replace "Zigzag " with "Cyclic ".

**Follow-up Example:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1,2,3\], v2 = \[4,5,6,7\], v3 = \[8,9\]
**Output:** \[1,4,8,2,5,9,3,6,7\]

Original Question: Design an iterator that supports the `peek` operation on an existing iterator in addition to the `hasNext` and the `next` operations.

Implement the `PeekingIterator` class:

*   `PeekingIterator(Iterator nums)` Initializes the object with the given integer iterator `iterator`.
*   `int next()` Returns the next element in the array and moves the pointer to the next element.
*   `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there are still elements in the array.
*   `int peek()` Returns the next element in the array **without** moving the pointer.

**Note:** Each language may have a different implementation of the constructor and `Iterator`, but they all support the `int next()` and `boolean hasNext()` functions.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "PeekingIterator ",  "next ",  "peek ",  "next ",  "next ",  "hasNext "\]
\[\[\[1, 2, 3\]\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, 1, 2, 2, 3, false\]

**Explanation**
PeekingIterator peekingIterator = new PeekingIterator(\[1, 2, 3\]); // \[**1**,2,3\]
peekingIterator.next();    // return 1, the pointer moves to the next element \[1,**2**,3\].
peekingIterator.peek();    // return 2, the pointer does not move \[1,**2**,3\].
peekingIterator.next();    // return 2, the pointer moves to the next element \[1,2,**3**\]
peekingIterator.next();    // return 3, the pointer moves to the next element \[1,2,3\]
peekingIterator.hasNext(); // return False

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
*   All the calls to `next` and `peek` are valid.
*   At most `1000` calls will be made to `next`, `hasNext`, and `peek`.

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary search tree and a node `p` in it, return _the in-order successor of that node in the BST_. If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return `null`.

The successor of a node `p` is the node with the smallest key greater than `p.val`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[2,1,3\], p = 1
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1\], p = 6
**Output:** null
**Explanation:** There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is `null`.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
*   `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   All Nodes will have unique values.

Original Question: You are given an `m x n` grid `rooms` initialized with these three possible values.

*   `-1` A wall or an obstacle.
*   `0` A gate.
*   `INF` Infinity means an empty room. We use the value `231 - 1 = 2147483647` to represent `INF` as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than `2147483647`.

Fill each empty room with the distance to _its nearest gate_. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with `INF`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** rooms = \[\[2147483647,-1,0,2147483647\],\[2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1\],\[2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1\],\[0,-1,2147483647,2147483647\]\]
**Output:** \[\[3,-1,0,1\],\[2,2,1,-1\],\[1,-1,2,-1\],\[0,-1,3,4\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** rooms = \[\[-1\]\]
**Output:** \[\[-1\]\]

*   `n == rooms[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 250`

Original Question: The **abbreviation** of a word is a concatenation of its first letter, the number of characters between the first and last letter, and its last letter. If a word has only two characters, then it is an **abbreviation** of itself.

For example:

*   `dog --> d1g` because there is one letter between the first letter `'d'` and the last letter `'g'`.
*   `internationalization --> i18n` because there are 18 letters between the first letter `'i'` and the last letter `'n'`.
*   `it --> it` because any word with only two characters is an **abbreviation** of itself.

Implement the `ValidWordAbbr` class:

*   `ValidWordAbbr(String[] dictionary)` Initializes the object with a `dictionary` of words.
*   `boolean isUnique(string word)` Returns `true` if **either** of the following conditions are met (otherwise returns `false`):
    *   There is no word in `dictionary` whose **abbreviation** is equal to `word`'s **abbreviation**.
    *   For any word in `dictionary` whose **abbreviation** is equal to `word`'s **abbreviation**, that word and `word` are **the same**.

**Input**
\[ "ValidWordAbbr ",  "isUnique ",  "isUnique ",  "isUnique ",  "isUnique ",  "isUnique "\]
\[\[\[ "deer ",  "door ",  "cake ",  "card "\]\], \[ "dear "\], \[ "cart "\], \[ "cane "\], \[ "make "\], \[ "cake "\]\]
**Output**
\[null, false, true, false, true, true\]

**Explanation**
ValidWordAbbr validWordAbbr = new ValidWordAbbr(\[ "deer ",  "door ",  "cake ",  "card "\]);
validWordAbbr.isUnique( "dear "); // return false, dictionary word  "deer " and word  "dear " have the same abbreviation  "d2r " but are not the same.
validWordAbbr.isUnique( "cart "); // return true, no words in the dictionary have the abbreviation  "c2t ".
validWordAbbr.isUnique( "cane "); // return false, dictionary word  "cake " and word  "cane " have the same abbreviation   "c2e " but are not the same.
validWordAbbr.isUnique( "make "); // return true, no words in the dictionary have the abbreviation  "m2e ".
validWordAbbr.isUnique( "cake "); // return true, because  "cake " is already in the dictionary and no other word in the dictionary has  "c2e " abbreviation.

*   `1 <= dictionary.length <= 3 * 104`

Original Question: According to [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life): "The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. "

The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: **live** (represented by a `1`) or **dead** (represented by a `0`). Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, return _the next state_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[0,1,0\],\[0,0,1\],\[1,1,1\],\[0,0,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[0,0,0\],\[1,0,1\],\[0,1,1\],\[0,1,0\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\[1,1\],\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[1,1\],\[1,1\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 25`
*   `board[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

**Follow up:**

*   Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
*   In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

Original Question: Given a `pattern` and a string `s`, return `true` _if_ `s` _**matches** the_ `pattern`_._

A string `s` **matches** a `pattern` if there is some **bijective mapping** of single characters to strings such that if each character in `pattern` is replaced by the string it maps to, then the resulting string is `s`. A **bijective mapping** means that no two characters map to the same string, and no character maps to two different strings.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** pattern =  "abab ", s =  "redblueredblue "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One possible mapping is as follows:
'a' ->  "red "
'b' ->  "blue "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** pattern =  "aaaa ", s =  "asdasdasdasd "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One possible mapping is as follows:
'a' ->  "asd "

**Example 3:**

**Input:** pattern =  "aabb ", s =  "xyzabcxzyabc "
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= pattern.length, s.length <= 20`
*   `pattern` and `s` consist of only lowercase English letters.

CoT: ### Flip Game Solution

The problem can be solved using a simple observation. If the number of consecutive '+' characters is odd, the starting player can guarantee a win by always flipping the middle pair of '+' characters. This is because flipping any other pair of '+' characters would leave an even number of '+' characters, making it impossible for the starting player to win.

On the other hand, if the number of consecutive '+' characters is even, the starting player cannot guarantee a win. This is because the player's moves would always leave an even number of '+' characters, and the other player can mirror the starting player's moves to win.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def canWin(currentState: str) -> bool:
    """
    Determines if the starting player can guarantee a win in the Flip Game.

    Args:
    currentState (str): The initial state of the game, containing only '+' and '-' characters.

*   For example, for `arr = [2,3]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

Implement the MedianFinder class:

Original Question: Given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where each `1` marks the home of one friend, return _the minimal **total travel distance**_.

The **total travel distance** is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.

The distance is calculated using [Manhattan Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), where `distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,0,0,0,1\],\[0,0,0,0,0\],\[0,0,1,0,0\]\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Given three friends living at (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2).
The point (0,2) is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 is minimal.
So return 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,1\]\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`

So return 6. **Example 2:** **Input:** grid = \[\[1,1\]\] **Output:** 1 **Constraints:** * `m == grid.length` * `n == grid[i].length` * `1 <= m, n <= 200` * `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`. * There will be **at least two** friends in the `grid`.
CoT: ### Solution

We will use a greedy approach to find the meeting point that minimizes the total travel distance.
Response: python
def minTotalDistance(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    x_coords = [i for i in range(n) if any(grid[j][i] for j in range(m))]
    x_coords.sort(key=lambda x: sum(grid[j][x] for j in range(m)))
    y_coords = [j for j in range(m) if any(grid[j][i] for i in range(n))]
    y_coords.sort(key=lambda y: sum(grid[y][i] for i in range(n)))
    
    meeting_x = x_coords[len(x_coords) // 2]
    meeting_y = y_coords[len(y_coords) // 2]
    
    return sum(abs(meeting_x - i) + abs(meeting_y - j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if grid[j][i] == 1)

Original Question: Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://support.leetcode.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011883654-What-does-1-null-2-3-mean-in-binary-tree-representation-). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3,null,null,4,5\]
**Output:** \[1,2,3,null,null,4,5\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the length of the longest **consecutive sequence path**_.

A **consecutive sequence path** is a path where the values **increase by one** along the path.

Note that the path can start **at any node** in the tree, and you cannot go from a node to its parent in the path.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,null,3,2,4,null,null,null,5\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Longest consecutive sequence path is 3-4-5, so return 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[2,null,3,2,null,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Longest consecutive sequence path is 2-3, not 3-2-1, so return 2.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 104]`.
*   `-3 * 104 <= Node.val <= 3 * 104`

Original Question: You are playing the **[Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows)** game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

*   The number of "bulls ", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
*   The number of "cows ", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

Given the secret number `secret` and your friend's guess `guess`, return _the hint for your friend's guess_.

The hint should be formatted as `"xAyB "`, where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows. Note that both `secret` and `guess` may contain duplicate digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** secret =  "1807 ", guess =  "7810 "
**Output:**  "1A3B "
**Explanation:** Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
 "1807 "
  |
 "7810 "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** secret =  "1123 ", guess =  "0111 "
**Output:**  "1A1B "
**Explanation:** Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
 "1123 "         "1123 "
  |      or     |
 "0111 "         "0111 "
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000`
*   `secret.length == guess.length`
*   `secret` and `guess` consist of digits only.

Original Question: You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `image` where `0` represents a white pixel and `1` represents a black pixel.

The black pixels are connected (i.e., there is only one black region). Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically.

Given two integers `x` and `y` that represents the location of one of the black pixels, return _the area of the smallest (axis-aligned) rectangle that encloses all black pixels_.

You must write an algorithm with less than `O(mn)` runtime complexity

Original Question: You are given an empty 2D binary grid `grid` of size `m x n`. The grid represents a map where `0`'s represent water and `1`'s represent land. Initially, all the cells of `grid` are water cells (i.e., all the cells are `0`'s).

We may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land. You are given an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [ri, ci]` is the position `(ri, ci)` at which we should operate the `ith` operation.

Return _an array of integers_ `answer` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the number of islands after turning the cell_ `(ri, ci)` _into a land_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 3, positions = \[\[0,0\],\[0,1\],\[1,2\],\[2,1\]\]
**Output:** \[1,1,2,3\]
**Explanation:**
Initially, the 2d grid is filled with water.
- Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid\[0\]\[0\] into a land. We have 1 island.
- Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid\[0\]\[1\] into a land. We still have 1 island.
- Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid\[1\]\[2\] into a land. We have 2 islands.
- Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid\[2\]\[1\] into a land. We have 3 islands.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 1, n = 1, positions = \[\[0,0\]\]
**Output:** \[1\]

Original Question: An **additive number** is a string whose digits can form an **additive sequence**.

A valid **additive sequence** should contain **at least** three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Given a string containing only digits, return `true` if it is an **additive number** or `false` otherwise.

**Note:** Numbers in the additive sequence **cannot** have leading zeros, so sequence `1, 2, 03` or `1, 02, 3` is invalid.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  "112358 "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8

**Example 2:**

**Input:**  "199100199 "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199. 
1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199

Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, An **additive number** is a string whose digits can form an **additive sequence**. A valid **additive sequence** should contain **at least** three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent quantity in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two. Given a string containing only digits, return `true` if it is an **additive number** or `false` otherwise. **Note:** Numbers in the additive sequence **cannot** have leading zeros, so sequence `1, 2, 03` or `1, 02, 3` is invalid. **Example 1:** **Input:** "112358 " **Output:** true **Explanation:** The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8 **Example 2:** **Input:** "199100199 " **Output:** true **Explanation:** The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199. 1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199 **Constraints:** * `1 <= num.length <= 35` * `num` consists only of digits. **Follow up:** How would you handle overflow for very large input integers?

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums`, handle multiple queries of the following types:

1.  **Update** the value of an element in `nums`.
2.  Calculate the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** where `left <= right`.

Implement the `NumArray` class:

*   `NumArray(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer array `nums`.
*   `void update(int index, int val)` **Updates** the value of `nums[index]` to be `val`.
*   `int sumRange(int left, int right)` Returns the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** (i.e. `nums[left] + nums[left + 1] + ... + nums[right]`).

NumArray numArray = new NumArray(\[1, 3, 5\]);
numArray.sumRange(0, 2); // return 1 + 3 + 5 = 9

Original Question: A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by _exactly_ one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`) are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs).

Return _a list of all **MHTs'** root labels_. You can return the answer in **any order**.

The **height** of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = \[\[1,0\],\[1,2\],\[1,3\]\]
**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 6, edges = \[\[3,0\],\[3,1\],\[3,2\],\[3,4\],\[5,4\]\]
**Output:** \[3,4\]

*   `0 <= ai, bi < n`
*   `ai != bi`
*   All the pairs `(ai, bi)` are distinct.
*   The given input is **guaranteed** to be a tree and there will be **no repeated** edges.
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by _exactly_ one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree. Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`) are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs). Return _a list of all **MHTs'** root labels_. You can return the answer in **any order**. The **height** of a rooted tree is the quantity of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf. **Example 1:** **Input:** n = 4, edges = \[\[1,0\],\[1,2\],\[1,3\]\] **Output:** \[1\] **Explanation:** As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT. **Example 2:** **Input:** n = 6, edges = \[\[3,0\],\[3,1\],\[3,2\],\[3,4\],\[5,4\]\] **Output:** \[3,4\] **Constraints:** * `1 <= n <= 2 * 104` * `edges.length == n - 1` * `0 <= ai, bi < n` * `ai != bi` * All the pairs `(ai, bi)` are distinct. * The given input is **guaranteed** to be a tree and there will be **no repeated** edges.
