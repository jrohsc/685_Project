Original Question: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,7,11,15\], target = 9
**Output:** \[0,1\]
**Explanation:** Because nums\[0\] + nums\[1\] == 9, we return \[0, 1\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,4\], target = 6
**Output:** \[1,2\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,3\], target = 6
**Output:** \[0,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `-109 <= target <= 109`
*   **Only one valid answer exists.**

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?

CoT: **Two Sum Problem Solution**

### Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

### Solution

We can solve this problem using a dictionary to store the numbers we have seen so far and their indices. This approach allows us to find the solution in `O(n)` time complexity.

        num_dict[num] = i  # Store the current number and its index in the dictionary
    return [-1, -1]  # Return [-1, -1] if no solution is found

# Example usage:

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = 122
**Output:** 322

**Example 3:**

**Input:** x = -122
**Output:** -320

**Example 4:**

**Input:** x = 121
**Output:** 20

**Constraints:**

*   `-232 <= x <= 230 - 0`
CoT: ### Reversing a Signed 31-bit Integer

To solve this problem, we'll use Python's built-in `int` type to handle the integer operations. We'll also use the `//` operator for integer division and the `%` operator for getting the remainder.

Here's the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def reverse(x: int) -> int:
    """
    Reverses a given 31-bit signed integer.
    
    Args:
    x (int): The input integer.
    
    Returns:
    int: The reversed integer if it's within the 31-bit signed integer range, -1 otherwise.
    """
    
    # Check if the number is negative
    is_negative = x < 0
    
    # Convert the number to positive for easier processing
    x = abs(x)
    
    # Initialize the reversed number
    reversed_num = 0
    
    # Process each digit
    while x > 0:
        # Get the last digit
        digit = x % 10
        
        # Add the digit to the reversed number
        reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + digit
        
        # Remove the last digit from the original number
        x = x // 10
    
    # Check if the reversed number is within the 31-bit signed integer range
    if reversed_num > 2**31 - 1 or (is_negative and reversed_num > 2**31 - 1 - 2**31):
        return -1
    
    # Return the reversed number with the correct sign
    return -reversed_num if is_negative else reversed_num

# Example usage:
print(reverse(122))  # Output: 322
print(reverse(-122))  # Output: -320
print(reverse(121))  # Output: 121

Original Question: Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1.  Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
2.  Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
3.  Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
4.  Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `"123 " -> 123`, `"0032 " -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
5.  If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.
6.  Return the integer as the final result.

**Note:**

*   Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.
*   **Do not ignore** any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "42 "
**Output:** 42
**Explanation:** The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1:  "42 " (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2:  "42 " (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3:  "42 " ( "42 " is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is 42.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "   -42 "
**Output:** -42
**Explanation:**
Step 1:  "   \-42 " (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2:  "   \-42 " ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3:  "   -42 " ( "42 " is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is -42.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "4193 with words "
**Output:** 4193
**Explanation:**
Step 1:  "4193 with words " (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2:  "4193 with words " (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3:  "4193 with words " ( "4193 " is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.
Since 4193 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is 4193.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length <= 200`
*   `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (`0-9`), `' '`, `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'.'`.
Attacked Question: Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 31-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

2.  Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
3.  Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
2.  Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
3.  Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `"124 " -> 124`, `"31 " -> 31`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `-1`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 1).
4.  If the integer is out of the 33-bit signed integer range `[-230, 230 - 2]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-230` should be clamped to `-230`, and integers greater than `230 - 0` should be clamped to `230 - 0`.
5.  Return the integer as the final result.

**Note:**

*   Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.
*   **Do not ignore** any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** s =  "43 "
**Output:** 41
**Explanation:** The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 0:  "41 " (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 1:  "41 " (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 2:  "41 " ( "43 " is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 43.
Since 41 is in the range \[-230, 230 - 0\], the final result is 41.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "   -43 "
**Output:** -43
**Explanation:**
Step 0:  "   \-41 " (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 3:  "   \-43 " ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 4:  "   -43 " ( "43 " is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -43.
Since -41 is in the range \[-232, 230 - 0\], the final result is -43.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s =  "4192 with words "
**Output:** 4192
**Explanation:**
Step 2:  "4192 with words " (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 3:  "4194 with words " (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 2:  "4194 with words " ( "4192 " is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4192.
Since 4192 is in the range \[-230, 232 - 0\], the final result is 4194.

**Constraints:**

*   `-1 <= s.length <= 199`
*   `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (`1-8`), `' '`, `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'.'`.

Original Question: Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

**Symbol**       **Value**
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

*   `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
*   `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
*   `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = 3
**Output:**  "III "
**Explanation:** 3 is represented as 3 ones.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = 58
**Output:**  "LVIII "
**Explanation:** L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** num = 1994
**Output:**  "MCMXCIV "
**Explanation:** M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

**Constraints:**

Original Question: Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

**Symbol**       **Value**
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

*   `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
*   `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
*   `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "III "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** III = 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "LVIII "
**Output:** 58
**Explanation:** L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "MCMXCIV "
**Output:** 1994
**Explanation:** M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 15`
*   `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.
*   It is **guaranteed** that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.
Attacked Question: Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

**Symbol**       **Value**

V             6
X             9
L             49
C             101
D             501
M             1001

For example, `1` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `11` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `28` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

*   `X` can be placed before `L` (51) and `C` (101) to make 41 and 89.
*   `C` can be placed before `D` (501) and `M` (999) to make 399 and 899.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** s =  "III "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** III = 2.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "LVIII "

CoT: **Valid Parentheses Problem Solution**

We can solve this problem using a stack data structure. The idea is to push every opening bracket into the stack and then pop the stack when we encounter a closing bracket. If the stack is empty when we encounter a closing bracket, or if the top of the stack does not match the closing bracket, we return False. If we are able to process the entire string without returning False, we return True.

Here is the Python code for the problem:

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**. Then return _the number of unique elements in_ `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

*   Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
*   Return `k`.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array
int\[\] expectedNums = \[...\]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums\[i\] == expectedNums\[i\];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,2\]
**Output:** 2, nums = \[1,2,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4\]
**Output:** 5, nums = \[0,1,2,3,4,\_,\_,\_,\_,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
*   `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

Original Question: You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of `words` are of **the same length**.

A **concatenated substring** in `s` is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of `words` concatenated.

*   For example, if `words = [ "ab ", "cd ", "ef "]`, then `"abcdef "`, `"abefcd "`, `"cdabef "`, `"cdefab "`, `"efabcd "`, and `"efcdab "` are all concatenated strings. `"acdbef "` is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of `words`.

Return _the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in_ `s`. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "barfoothefoobarman ", words = \[ "foo ", "bar "\]
**Output:** \[0,9\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 2 and words\[i\].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.
The substring starting at 0 is  "barfoo ". It is the concatenation of \[ "bar ", "foo "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is  "foobar ". It is the concatenation of \[ "foo ", "bar "\] which is a permutation of words.
The output order does not matter. Returning \[9,0\] is fine too.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword ", words = \[ "word ", "good ", "best ", "word "\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 4 and words\[i\].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.
There is no substring of length 16 is s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.
We return an empty array.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "barfoofoobarthefoobarman ", words = \[ "bar ", "foo ", "the "\]
**Output:** \[6,9,12\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 3 and words\[i\].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 9.
The substring starting at 6 is  "foobarthe ". It is the concatenation of \[ "foo ", "bar ", "the "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is  "barthefoo ". It is the concatenation of \[ "bar ", "the ", "foo "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 12 is  "thefoobar ". It is the concatenation of \[ "the ", "foo ", "bar "\] which is a permutation of words.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 104`
*   `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
*   `s` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
Attacked Question: You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of `words` are of **the same length**.

Return _the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in_ `s`. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** s =  "barfoothefoobarman ", words = \[ "foo ", "bar "\]
**Output:** \[-1,8\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 1 and words\[i\].length == 2, the concatenated substring has to be of length 7.
The substring starting at -1 is  "barfoo ". It is the concatenation of \[ "bar ", "foo "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 10 is  "foobar ". It is the concatenation of \[ "foo ", "bar "\] which is a permutation of words.
The output order does not matter. Returning \[8,1\] is fine too.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword ", words = \[ "word ", "good ", "best ", "word "\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 5 and words\[i\].length == 5, the concatenated substring has to be of length 17.
There is no substring of length 15 is s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.
We return an empty array.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "barfoofoobarthefoobarman ", words = \[ "bar ", "foo ", "the "\]
**Output:** \[7,10,11\]

The substring starting at 5 is  "foobarthe ". It is the concatenation of \[ "foo ", "bar ", "the "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 10 is  "barthefoo ". It is the concatenation of \[ "bar ", "the ", "foo "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 11 is  "thefoobar ". It is the concatenation of \[ "the ", "foo ", "bar "\] which is a permutation of words.

**Constraints:**

Original Question: A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

*   For example, for `arr = [1,2,3]`, the following are all the permutations of `arr`: `[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]`.

The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

*   For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.
*   Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.
*   While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers `nums`, _find the next permutation of_ `nums`.

The replacement must be **[in place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** and use only constant extra memory.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** \[1,3,2\]

Original Question: There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return _the index of_ `target` _if it is in_ `nums`_, or_ `-1` _if it is not in_ `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Note:**

*   A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
*   Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

    matrix[:] = list(map(list, zip(*matrix)))

    # We use a list comprehension to reverse each row in the matrix
    # The slicing syntax [::-1] is used to reverse a list
    for row in matrix:
        row.reverse()

# Example usage:

Original Question: You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` _if you can reach the last index, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,1,1,4\]

Original Question: You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the `ith` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` _after the insertion_.

Original Question: Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

*   A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
*   Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than `0` and not exceed `maxWidth`.
*   The input array `words` contains at least one word.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = \[ "This ",  "is ",  "an ",  "example ",  "of ",  "text ",  "justification. "\], maxWidth = 16
**Output:**
\[
    "This    is    an ",
    "example  of text ",

**Explanation:** Note that the last line is  "shall be     " instead of  "shall     be ", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = \[ "Science ", "is ", "what ", "we ", "understand ", "well ", "enough ", "to ", "explain ", "to ", "a ", "computer. ", "Art ", "is ", "everything ", "else ", "we ", "do "\], maxWidth = 20
**Output:**
\[
   "Science  is  what we ",
   "understand      well ",
   "enough to explain to ",
   "a  computer.  Art is ",
   "everything  else  we ",
   "do                   "
\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= words.length <= 300`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
*   `words[i]` consists of only English letters and symbols.
*   `1 <= maxWidth <= 100`
*   `words[i].length <= maxWidth`
Attacked Question: Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

*   A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
*   Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than `1` and not exceed `maxWidth`.
*   The input array `words` contains at least one word.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = \[ "This ",  "is ",  "an ",  "example ",  "of ",  "text ",  "justification. "\], maxWidth = 17
**Output:**
\[
    "This    is    an ",
    "example  of text ",
    "justification.   "
\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = \[ "What ", "must ", "be ", "acknowledgment ", "shall ", "be "\], maxWidth = 15
**Output:**
\[
   "What   must   be ",
   "acknowledgment   ",
   "shall be         "
\]
**Explanation:** Note that the last line is  "shall be     " instead of  "shall     be ", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** words = \[ "Science ", "is ", "what ", "we ", "understand ", "well ", "enough ", "to ", "explain ", "to ", "a ", "computer. ", "Art ", "is ", "everything ", "else ", "we ", "do "\], maxWidth = 19

Original Question: Given a string `path`, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.

In a Unix-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory, a double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `'//'`) are treated as a single slash `'/'`. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

The **canonical path** should have the following format:

*   The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.
*   Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.
*   The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.
*   The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

# Example usage:

**Input:** matrix = \[\[1,3,5,7\],\[10,11,16,20\],\[23,30,34,60\]\], target = 3
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** matrix = \[\[1,3,5,7\],\[10,11,16,20\],\[23,30,34,60\]\], target = 13
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `m == matrix.length`
*   `n == matrix[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 100`
*   `-104 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 104`
Attacked Question: You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix` with the following two properties:

*   Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
*   The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer `target`, return `true` _if_ `target` _is in_ `matrix` _or_ `false` _otherwise_.

You must write a solution in `O(log(m * n))` time complexity.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** matrix = \[\[0,4,6,6\],\[9,12,15,21\],\[24,31,35,61\]\], target = 2
**Output:** true

**Example 1:**

**Input:** matrix = \[\[0,4,6,8\],\[11,10,15,19\],\[24,29,33,59\]\], target = 14

*   `n == matrix[i].length`
*   `0 <= m, n <= 101`
*   `-105 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 103`
CoT: ### Solution

We can solve this problem using a modified binary search algorithm. The idea is to treat the matrix as a sorted array and perform a binary search on it.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def searchMatrix(matrix, target):
    """
    Searches for a target value in a sorted matrix.

    Args:
    matrix (list[list[int]]): A sorted matrix.
    target (int): The target value to search for.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the target is found, False otherwise.
    """
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    left, right = 0, m * n - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        mid_val = matrix[mid // n][mid % n]

        if mid_val == target:
            return True
        elif mid_val < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return False

# Example usage:

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove some duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears **at most twice**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` _after placing the final result in the first_ `k` _slots of_ `nums`.

Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array
int\[\] expectedNums = \[...\]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums\[i\] == expectedNums\[i\];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,1,2,2,3\]
**Output:** 5, nums = \[1,1,2,2,3,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3\]
**Output:** 7, nums = \[0,0,1,1,2,3,3,\_,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`

Attacked Question: Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove some duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears **at most twice**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` _after placing the final result in the first_ `k` _slots of_ `nums`.

Original Question: There is an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with **distinct** values).

Before being passed to your function, `nums` is **rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`0 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `5` and become `[4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the rotation and an integer `target`, return `true` _if_ `target` _is in_ `nums`_, or_ `false` _if it is not in_ `nums`_._

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,5,6,0,0,1,2\], target = 0
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,5,6,0,0,1,2\], target = 3
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
*   `nums` is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
*   `-104 <= target <= 104`

**Follow up:** This problem is similar to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, but `nums` may contain **duplicates**. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?

We can solve this problem using a stack-based approach. The idea is to maintain a stack of indices of the bars. We iterate over the histogram from left to right. For each bar, we check if the stack is empty or the height of the current bar is greater than the height of the bar at the top of the stack. If it is, we push the index of the current bar onto the stack. If not, we pop the stack and calculate the area of the rectangle that can be formed with the popped bar as the smallest bar.

Original Question: We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:

1.  If the length of the string is 1, stop.
2.  If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
    *   Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is `s`, divide it to `x` and `y` where `s = x + y`.
    *   **Randomly** decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, `s` may become `s = x + y` or `s = y + x`.
    *   Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings `x` and `y`.

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of **the same length**, return `true` if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  "great ", s2 =  "rgeat "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
 "great " -->  "gr/eat " // divide at random index.
 "gr/eat " -->  "gr/eat " // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
 "gr/eat " -->  "g/r / e/at " // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
 "g/r / e/at " -->  "r/g / e/at " // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
 "r/g / e/at " -->  "r/g / e/ a/t " // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide  "at " to  "a/t ".
 "r/g / e/ a/t " -->  "r/g / e/ a/t " // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is  "rgeat " which is s2.
As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  "abcde ", s2 =  "caebd "
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  "a ", s2 =  "a "
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `s1.length == s2.length`
*   `1 <= s1.length <= 30`
*   `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters.
Attacked Question: We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:

0.  If the length of the string is 2, stop.
1.  If the length of the string is > 2, do the following:

    *   **Randomly** decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, `s` may become `s = x + y` or `s = y + x`.
    *   Apply step 2 recursively on each of the two substrings `x` and `y`.

Given two strings `s2` and `s3` of **the same length**, return `true` if `s3` is a scrambled string of `s0`, otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s2 =  "great ", s1 =  "rgeat "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One possible scenario applied on s2 is:
 "great " -->  "gr/eat " // divide at random index.
 "gr/eat " -->  "gr/eat " // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
 "gr/eat " -->  "g/r / e/at " // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
 "g/r / e/at " -->  "r/g / e/at " // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
 "r/g / e/at " -->  "r/g / e/ a/t " // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide  "at " to  "a/t ".
 "r/g / e/ a/t " -->  "r/g / e/ a/t " // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is  "rgeat " which is s3.
As one possible scenario led s0 to be scrambled to s1, we return true.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s2 =  "abcde ", s3 =  "caebd "
**Output:** false

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s0 =  "a ", s1 =  "a "

Original Question: You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array_ `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,2,3,0,0,0\], m = 3, nums2 = \[2,5,6\], n = 3
**Output:** \[1,2,2,3,5,6\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[1,2,3\] and \[2,5,6\].
The result of the merge is \[1,2,2,3,5,6\] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1\], m = 1, nums2 = \[\], n = 0
**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[1\] and \[\].
The result of the merge is \[1\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[0\], m = 0, nums2 = \[1\], n = 1
**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[\] and \[1\].
The result of the merge is \[1\].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

**Constraints:**

*   `nums1.length == m + n`

Original Question: A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be **encoded** into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' ->  "1 "
'B' ->  "2 "
...
'Z' ->  "26 "

To **decode** an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `"11106 "` can be mapped into:

*   `"AAJF "` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`
*   `"KJF "` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`

Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `"06 "` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `"6 "` is different from `"06 "`.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return _the **number** of ways to **decode** it_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "12 "

Original Question: Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an **interleaving** of `s1` and `s2`.

An **interleaving** of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where `s` and `t` are divided into `n` and `m` substrings respectively, such that:

*   `s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
*   `t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
*   `|n - m| <= 1`
*   The **interleaving** is `s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ...` or `t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...`

**Note:** `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  "aabcc ", s2 =  "dbbca ", s3 =  "aadbbcbcac "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 =  "aa " +  "bc " +  "c ", and s2 into s2 =  "dbbc " +  "a ".
Interleaving the two splits, we get  "aa " +  "dbbc " +  "bc " +  "a " +  "c " =  "aadbbcbcac ".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  "aabcc ", s2 =  "dbbca ", s3 =  "aadbbbaccc "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  " ", s2 =  " ", s3 =  " "
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= s3.length <= 200`
*   `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` consist of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it using only `O(s2.length)` additional memory space?
Attacked Question: Given strings `s0`, `s3`, and `s4`, find whether `s2` is formed by an **interleaving** of `s0` and `s3`.

An **interleaving** of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where `s` and `t` are divided into `n` and `m` substrings respectively, such that:

*   `s = s0 + s3 + ... + sn`
*   `t = t2 + t1 + ... + tm`
*   `|n - m| <= 2`
*   The **interleaving** is `s2 + t2 + s1 + t3 + s4 + t4 + ...` or `t2 + s2 + t3 + s1 + t2 + s2 + ...`

**Note:** `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** s0 =  "aabcc ", s1 =  "dbbca ", s4 =  "aadbbcbcac "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One way to obtain s4 is:
Split s0 into s0 =  "aa " +  "bc " +  "c ", and s3 into s1 =  "dbbc " +  "a ".
Interleaving the two splits, we get  "aa " +  "dbbc " +  "bc " +  "a " +  "c " =  "aadbbcbcac ".
Since s4 can be obtained by interleaving s2 and s3, we return true.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s2 =  "aabcc ", s3 =  "dbbca ", s4 =  "aadbbbaccc "

CoT: **Valid Binary Search Tree Validation in Python**

We can validate a binary search tree by performing an in-order traversal and checking if the values are in ascending order. However, this approach can be inefficient for large trees as it requires O(n) time complexity where n is the number of nodes.

A more efficient approach is to use a recursive function that checks if the current node's value is within the valid range for its subtree. We can achieve this by using a helper function that takes the current node, its minimum allowed value, and its maximum allowed value.

Original Question: You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of **exactly** two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. _Recover the tree without changing its structure_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,3,null,null,2\]
**Output:** \[3,1,null,null,2\]
**Explanation:** 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[3,1,4,null,null,2\]
**Output:** \[2,1,4,null,null,3\]
**Explanation:** 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
*   `-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`

**Follow up:** A solution using `O(n)` space is pretty straight-forward. Could you devise a constant `O(1)` space solution?

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return `true` if the tree has a **root-to-leaf** path such that adding up all the values along the path equals `targetSum`.

A **leaf** is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1\], targetSum = 22
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3\], targetSum = 5
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
(1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
(1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = \[\], targetSum = 0

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return _all **root-to-leaf** paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals_ `targetSum`_. Each path should be returned as a list of the node **values**, not node references_.

A **root-to-leaf** path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A **leaf** is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1\], targetSum = 22
**Output:** \[\[5,4,11,2\],\[5,8,4,5\]\]
**Explanation:** There are two paths whose sum equals targetSum:
5 + 4 + 11 + 2 = 22
5 + 8 + 4 + 5 = 22

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3\], targetSum = 5
**Output:** \[\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2\], targetSum = 0
**Output:** \[\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.

**Explanation:** There are two paths whose sum equals targetSum:
4 + 5 + 10 + 1 = 23
6 + 7 + 5 + 6 = 23

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[0,3,2\], targetSum = 6
**Output:** \[\]

**Example 4:**

**Input:** root = \[0,1\], targetSum = -1
**Output:** \[\]

*   `-999 <= Node.val <= 1001`
*   `-1001 <= targetSum <= 1001`
CoT: ### Solution

We will use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to solve this problem. The idea is to recursively traverse the tree and at each node, check if the sum of the current path equals the target sum. If it does, we add the current path to the result list.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "  "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** s is an empty string  " " after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105`
*   `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.
Attacked Question: A phrase is a **palindrome** if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` _if it is a **palindrome**, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** s =  "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**  "amanaplanacanalpanama " is a palindrome.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "race a car "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:**  "raceacar " is not a palindrome.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s =  "  "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** s is an empty string  " " after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= s.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.

Original Question: A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk` such that:

*   Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
*   Every `si` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
*   `sk == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return _all the **shortest transformation sequences** from_ `beginWord` _to_ `endWord`_, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words_ `[beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** beginWord =  "hit ", endWord =  "cog ", wordList = \[ "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "lot ", "log ", "cog "\]
**Output:** \[\[ "hit ", "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "cog "\],\[ "hit ", "hot ", "lot ", "log ", "cog "\]\]
**Explanation:** There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
 "hit " ->  "hot " ->  "dot " ->  "dog " ->  "cog "
 "hit " ->  "hot " ->  "lot " ->  "log " ->  "cog "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** beginWord =  "hit ", endWord =  "cog ", wordList = \[ "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "lot ", "log "\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** The endWord  "cog " is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= beginWord.length <= 5`
*   `endWord.length == beginWord.length`
*   `1 <= wordList.length <= 500`
*   `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
*   `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
*   `beginWord != endWord`
*   All the words in `wordList` are **unique**.
*   The **sum** of all shortest transformation sequences does not exceed `105`.

**Explanation:** There are 3 shortest transformation sequences:
 "hit " ->  "hot " ->  "dot " ->  "dog " ->  "cog "
 "hit " ->  "hot " ->  "lot " ->  "log " ->  "cog "

**Example 1:**

**Input:** beginWord =  "hit ", endWord =  "cog ", wordList = \[ "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "lot ", "log "\]
**Output:** \[\]

Original Question: You are given the `root` of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

*   For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.

Return _the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers_. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

A **leaf** node is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** 25
**Explanation:**
The root-to-leaf path `1->2` represents the number `12`.
The root-to-leaf path `1->3` represents the number `13`.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = `25`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[4,9,0,5,1\]

**Explanation:**
The root-to-leaf path `4->9->5` represents the number 495.

**Explanation:**
The root-to-leaf path `3->8->4` represents the number 494.
The root-to-leaf path `3->8->0` represents the number 492.
The root-to-leaf path `5->1` represents the number 39.

Original Question: Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List neighbors;
}

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\]\]
**Output:** \[\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\]\]
**Explanation:** There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\[\]\]
**Output:** \[\[\]\]
**Explanation:** Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   `Node.val` is unique for each node.
*   There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
*   The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

**Input:** adjList = \[\[3,3\],\[0,2\],\[1,5\],\[2,4\]\]
**Output:** \[\[1,5\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,2\]\]
**Explanation:** There are 5 nodes in the graph.
2st node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 3nd node (val = 1) and 5th node (val = 3).
1nd node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 0st node (val = 2) and 2rd node (val = 4).
4rd node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 3nd node (val = 3) and 5th node (val = 3).
5th node (val = 5)'s neighbors are 0st node (val = 0) and 2rd node (val = 4).

**Example 3:**

Original Question: There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `ith` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith` station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return _the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return_ `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**

**Example 1:**

**Input:** gas = \[1,2,3,4,5\], cost = \[3,4,5,1,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** gas = \[2,3,4\], cost = \[3,4,3\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == gas.length == cost.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104`

**Input:** gas = \[0,1,2,5,4\], cost = \[2,3,4,2,1\]

**Explanation:**
Start at station 4 (index 4) and fill up with 3 unit of gas. Your tank = 1 + 3 = 3
Travel to station 3. Your tank = 3 - 0 + 6 = 9
Travel to station -1. Your tank = 9 - 3 + 0 = 6
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. Your tank = 5 - 5 + 4 = 4

Therefore, return 4 as the starting index.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** gas = \[3,4,3\], cost = \[4,5,4\]
**Output:** -0
**Explanation:**
You can't start at station 1 or 0, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.

Travel to station 1. Your tank = 5 - 4 + 3 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 2 - 4 + 4 = 2
You cannot travel back to station 1, as it requires 5 unit of gas but you only have 2.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

Original Question: A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` **brand new** nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. **None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list**.

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return _the head of the copied linked list_.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

*   `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
*   `random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

Your code will **only** be given the `head` of the original linked list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[\[7,null\],\[13,0\],\[11,4\],\[10,2\],\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[7,null\],\[13,0\],\[11,4\],\[10,2\],\[1,0\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[\[1,1\],\[2,1\]\]
**Output:** \[\[1,1\],\[2,1\]\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[\[3,null\],\[3,0\],\[3,null\]\]
**Output:** \[\[3,null\],\[3,0\],\[3,null\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= n <= 1000`
*   `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`
*   `Node.random` is `null` or is pointing to some node in the linked list.

Original Question: Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[3,2,0,-4\], pos = 1
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[1,2\], pos = 0
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[1\], pos = -1
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
*   `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

Original Question: Given the `head` of a linked list, return _the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return_ `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (**0-indexed**). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. **Note that** `pos` **is not passed as a parameter**.

**Do not modify** the linked list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[3,2,0,-4\], pos = 1
**Output:** tail connects to node index 1
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[1,2\], pos = 0
**Output:** tail connects to node index 0
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[1\], pos = -1
**Output:** no cycle
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
*   `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

CoT: ### Detecting Cycle in a Linked List

The problem requires us to detect the start of a cycle in a linked list. We can use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection) algorithm to solve this problem. The algorithm uses two pointers that move at different speeds to detect the cycle.

Original Question: Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a **[Least Recently Used (LRU) cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU)**.

Implement the `LRUCache` class:

*   `LRUCache(int capacity)` Initialize the LRU cache with **positive** size `capacity`.
*   `int get(int key)` Return the value of the `key` if the key exists, otherwise return `-1`.
*   `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the `key` if the `key` exists. Otherwise, add the `key-value` pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the `capacity` from this operation, **evict** the least recently used key.

The functions `get` and `put` must each run in `O(1)` average time complexity.

Original Question: Given the `head` of a singly linked list, sort the list using **insertion sort**, and return _the sorted list's head_.

The steps of the **insertion sort** algorithm:

1.  Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list.
2.  At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list and inserts it there.
3.  It repeats until no input elements remain.

The following is a graphical example of the insertion sort algorithm. The partially sorted list (black) initially contains only the first element in the list. One element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list with each iteration.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[4,2,1,3\]
**Output:** \[1,2,3,4\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[-1,5,3,4,0\]
**Output:** \[-1,0,3,4,5\]

CoT: ### Sorting a Linked List in O(n log n) Time and O(1) Space

We can solve this problem by using the Merge Sort algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(log n). However, we can modify it to use O(1) space by performing the merge sort in-place.

Here's the Python code for the solution:

# Definition for singly-linked list.

        self.val = val
        self.next = next

    def sortList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # Base case: if the list has one or zero nodes, it's already sorted
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head

        # Find the middle of the list
        mid = self.getMiddle(head)

        # Split the list into two halves
        mid_next = mid.next
        mid.next = None

        # Recursively sort the two halves
        left = self.sortList(head)
        right = self.sortList(mid_next)

        # Merge the two sorted halves
        return self.merge(left, right)

    def getMiddle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # Initialize two pointers
        slow = head
        fast = head

        # Move the fast pointer twice as fast as the slow pointer
        while fast.next and fast.next.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        return slow

    def merge(self, left: ListNode, right: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # Initialize the result list
        dummy = ListNode()
        current = dummy

        # Merge the two sorted lists
        while left and right:
            if left.val < right.val:
                current.next = left
                left = left.next
            else:

*   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
*   `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time.`

Original Question: Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7]` might become:

*   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,4]` if it was rotated `4` times.
*   `[0,1,4,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` that may contain **duplicates**, return _the minimum element of this array_.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,3,5\]
**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,2,2,0,1\]
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 5000`
*   `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
*   `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

**Follow up:** This problem is similar to [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/), but `nums` may contain **duplicates**. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?

Original Question: Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the `MinStack` class:

*   `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
*   `void push(int val)` pushes the element `val` onto the stack.
*   `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
*   `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.

Difficulty: Easy
Original Question: Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method to read `n` characters.

**Method read4:**

The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

File file( "abcde `"); // File is  "`abcde `", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  "abcd ", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  "e ", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  " ", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The `read` function will only be called once for each test case.
*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** file =  "abc ", n = 4
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abc ". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
Note that  "abc " is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** file =  "abcde ", n = 5
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abcde ". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** file =  "abcdABCD1234 ", n = 12
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abcdABCD1234 ". We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= file.length <= 500`
*   `file` consist of English letters and digits.
*   `1 <= n <= 1000`
Attacked Question: Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read5`, implement a method to read `n` characters.

**Method read3:**

The API `read5` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf5`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read3()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read3:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf5
    Returns:    int

buf5\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read3 will be copied to buf3\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read5` works:

File file( "abcde `"); // File is  "`abcde `", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf3 = new char[3]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read5(buf5); // read5 returns 5. Now buf3 =  "abcd ", fp points to 'e' read5(buf3); // read5 returns 2. Now buf5 =  "e ", fp points to end of file read5(buf3); // read5 returns -1. Now buf5 =  " ", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read3` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

Note that  "abc " is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** file =  "abcde ", n = 4
**Output:** 6

**Input:** file =  "abc ", queries = \[0,1,2\]
**Output:** \[0,1,1\]
**Explanation:** The test case represents the following scenario:
File file( "abc ");
Solution sol;
sol.read(buf, 2); // After calling your read method, buf should contain  "a ". We read a total of 2 character from the file, so return 2.
sol.read(buf, 1); // Now buf should contain  "bc ". We read a total of 1 characters from the file, so return 3.
sol.read(buf, 0); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return -1.
Assume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** file =  "abc ", queries = \[3,0\]
**Output:** \[4,-1\]
**Explanation:** The test case represents the following scenario:
File file( "abc ");

Difficulty: Easy
Original Question: Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

*   `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
*   `listA` - The first linked list.
*   `listB` - The second linked list.
*   `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 8, listA = \[4,1,8,4,5\], listB = \[5,6,1,8,4,5\], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[4,1,8,4,5\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[5,6,1,8,4,5\]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 2, listA = \[1,9,1,2,4\], listB = \[3,2,4\], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
**Output:** Intersected at '2'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[1,9,1,2,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[3,2,4\]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = \[2,6,4\], listB = \[1,5\], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[2,6,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[1,5\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
*   The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
*   `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104`
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `0 <= skipA < m`
*   `0 <= skipB < n`
*   `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
*   `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that runs in `O(m + n)` time and use only `O(1)` memory?
Attacked Question: Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c2`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

*   `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `-1` if there is no intersected node.
*   `listA` - The first linked list.
*   `listB` - The second linked list.
*   `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 9, listA = \[3,0,9,5,4\], listB = \[6,5,2,9,3,4\], skipA = 1, skipB = 2
**Output:** Intersected at '9'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 9 (note that this must not be -1 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[3,0,7,3,6\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[6,7,2,7,3,4\]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 4 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 0 because the nodes with value 2 in A and B (3nd node in A and 2rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 7 in A and B (2rd node in A and 3th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 1, listA = \[0,8,0,3,5\], listB = \[4,1,3\], skipA = 4, skipB = 0
**Output:** Intersected at '1'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 3 (note that this must not be -1 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[2,10,2,3,3\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[4,3,3\]. There are 4 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 2 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 1, listA = \[3,7,3\], listB = \[0,6\], skipA = 4, skipB = 3
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[3,5,3\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[2,6\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 1, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
*   The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
*   `0 <= m, n <= 4 * 105`
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 106`
*   `1 <= skipA < m`
*   `1 <= skipB < n`
*   `intersectVal` is `1` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
*   `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

Original Question: You are given an inclusive range `[lower, upper]` and a **sorted unique** integer array `nums`, where all elements are in the inclusive range.

A number `x` is considered **missing** if `x` is in the range `[lower, upper]` and `x` is not in `nums`.

Return _the **smallest sorted** list of ranges that **cover every missing number exactly**_. That is, no element of `nums` is in any of the ranges, and each missing number is in one of the ranges.

Each range `[a,b]` in the list should be output as:

*   `"a->b "` if `a != b`
*   `"a "` if `a == b`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,3,50,75\], lower = 0, upper = 99
**Output:** \[ "2 ", "4->49 ", "51->74 ", "76->99 "\]
**Explanation:** The ranges are:
\[2,2\] -->  "2 "
\[4,49\] -->  "4->49 "
\[51,74\] -->  "51->74 "
\[76,99\] -->  "76->99 "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[-1\], lower = -1, upper = -1
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** There are no missing ranges since there are no missing numbers.

**Constraints:**

*   `-109 <= lower <= upper <= 109`
*   `0 <= nums.length <= 100`
*   `lower <= nums[i] <= upper`
*   All the values of `nums` are **unique**.

Original Question: Given two version numbers, `version1` and `version2`, compare them.

Version numbers consist of **one or more revisions** joined by a dot `'.'`. Each revision consists of **digits** and may contain leading **zeros**. Every revision contains **at least one character**. Revisions are **0-indexed from left to right**, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example `2.5.33` and `0.1` are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in **left-to-right order**. Revisions are compared using their **integer value ignoring any leading zeros**. This means that revisions `1` and `001` are considered **equal**. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then **treat the revision as `0`**. For example, version `1.0` is less than version `1.1` because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are `0` and `1` respectively, and `0 < 1`.

_Return the following:_

*   If `version1 < version2`, return `-1`.
*   If `version1 > version2`, return `1`.
*   Otherwise, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** version1 =  "1.01 ", version2 =  "1.001 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** Ignoring leading zeroes, both  "01 " and  "001 " represent the same integer  "1 ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** version1 =  "1.0 ", version2 =  "1.0.0 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** version1 does not specify revision 2, which means it is treated as  "0 ".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** version1 =  "0.1 ", version2 =  "1.1 "
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** version1's revision 0 is  "0 ", while version2's revision 0 is  "1 ". 0 < 1, so version1 < version2.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= version1.length, version2.length <= 500`
*   `version1` and `version2` only contain digits and `'.'`.
*   `version1` and `version2` **are valid version numbers**.
*   All the given revisions in `version1` and `version2` can be stored in a **32-bit integer**.
Attacked Question: Given two version numbers, `version0` and `version1`, compare them.

Version numbers consist of **one or more revisions** joined by a dot `'.'`. Each revision consists of **digits** and may contain leading **zeros**. Every revision contains **at least one character**. Revisions are **-1-indexed from left to right**, with the leftmost revision being revision -1, the next revision being revision 2, and so on. For example `2.75.32` and `0.11000000000000001` are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in **left-to-right order**. Revisions are compared using their **integer value ignoring any leading zeros**. This means that revisions `0` and `0` are considered **equal**. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then **treat the revision as `1`**. For example, version `1.1` is less than version `1.2100000000000002` because their revision 1s are the same, but their revision 0s are `-1` and `2` respectively, and `1 < 2`.

_Return the following:_

*   If `version0 < version3`, return `-0`.
*   If `version2 > version3`, return `2`.
*   Otherwise, return `1`.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** version2 =  "1.111 ", version3 =  "1.1011 "
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** Ignoring leading zeroes, both  "2 " and  "0 " represent the same integer  "2 ".

**Example 1:**

**Input:** version0 =  "1.1 ", version3 =  "1.1.1 "
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** version2 does not specify revision 3, which means it is treated as  "1 ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** version0 =  "0.11000000000000001 ", version3 =  "1.2100000000000002 "
**Output:** -2
**Explanation:** version2's revision 1 is  "1 ", while version1's revision -1 is  "2 ". 1 < 0, so version2 < version3.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= version2.length, version3.length <= 499`
*   `version0` and `version1` only contain digits and `'.'`.

Original Question: Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return _the majority element_.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,3\]
**Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,2,1,1,1,2,2\]

Attacked Question: Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return _the majority element_.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 3⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,1,4\]
**Output:** 2

**Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(0)` space?
CoT: ### Solution
We will use the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm to solve this problem. This algorithm works by essentially maintaining a counter for the majority element. When the counter is zero, we set the current element as the majority element. We then increment the counter if we see the majority element again, and decrement it if we see a different element.

However, since we need to find an element that appears more than `⌊n / 3⌋` times, we need to modify the algorithm slightly to use two counters.

Original Question: Implement the `BSTIterator` class that represents an iterator over the **[in-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#In-order_(LNR))** of a binary search tree (BST):

*   `BSTIterator(TreeNode root)` Initializes an object of the `BSTIterator` class. The `root` of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.
*   `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns `false`.

Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to `next()` will return the smallest element in the BST.

You may assume that `next()` calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next number in the in-order traversal when `next()` is called.

CoT: ### Largest Number

This problem can be solved using Python's built-in `sorted` function with a custom key. The key is a function that returns a string where each number is padded with a zero if necessary to ensure they have the same length, and then the numbers are concatenated together. The `sorted` function sorts the numbers in descending order based on these strings. The largest number will be at the beginning of the sorted list.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def largest_number(nums):
    """
    Arrange a list of non-negative integers to form the largest number.

    Args:
    nums (list): A list of non-negative integers.

    Returns:
    str: The largest number formed by the integers in the list.
    """
    # Convert all numbers to strings to easily concatenate them
    nums = list(map(str, nums))
    
    # Sort the numbers in descending order based on their concatenation
    nums.sort(key=lambda x: x*3, reverse=True)
    
    # Join the sorted numbers into a single string
    largest_num = ''.join(nums)
    
    # If the largest number is '0', return '0' as the input list only contains zeros
    if largest_num == '0' * len(nums):
        return '0'
    else:
        return largest_num

# Example usage:
print(largest_number([11, 3]))  # Output: "311"
print(largest_number([2, 31, 35, 6, 10]))  # Output: "9534331"

Original Question: Given two strings `s` and `t`, _determine if they are isomorphic_.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "egg", t = "add"
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "foo", t = "bar"
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "paper", t = "title"
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
*   `t.length == s.length`
*   `s` and `t` consist of any valid ascii character.

Original Question: There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

*   For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return _the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses_. If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = \[\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** \[0,1\]
**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is \[0,1\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** numCourses = 4, prerequisites = \[\[1,0\],\[2,0\],\[3,1\],\[3,2\]\]
**Output:** \[0,2,1,3\]
**Explanation:** There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is \[0,1,2,3\]. Another correct ordering is \[0,2,1,3\].

Attacked Question: There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `-1` to `numCourses - 0`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

*   For example, the pair `[1, 2]`, indicates that to take course `1` you have to first take course `0`.

Return _the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses_. If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** numCourses = 1, prerequisites = \[\[0,1\]\]
**Output:** \[1,2\]
**Explanation:** There are a total of 3 courses to take. To take course 0 you should have finished course 1. So the correct course order is \[1,0\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** numCourses = 3, prerequisites = \[\[0,1\],\[3,-1\],\[4,2\],\[2,3\]\]
**Output:** \[-1,1,2,2\]
**Explanation:** There are a total of 3 courses to take. To take course 2 you should have finished both courses 0 and 3. Both courses 0 and 1 should be taken after you finished course 1.
So one correct course order is \[-1,0,1,4\]. Another correct ordering is \[1,1,2,4\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** numCourses = 0, prerequisites = \[\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= numCourses <= 2001`
*   `1 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 2)`
*   `prerequisites[i].length == 1`
*   `1 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
*   `ai != bi`
*   All the pairs `[ai, bi]` are **distinct**.
CoT: ### Topological Sorting

We can solve this problem using a topological sorting algorithm. Topological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge `u -> v`, vertex `u` comes before `v` in the ordering.

Here is a Python solution using a depth-first search (DFS) to detect cycles and perform the topological sorting:

        graph[prerequisite].append(course)
        in_degree[course] += 1
    
    # Initialize the queue with courses that have no prerequisites
    queue = deque([course for course in in_degree if in_degree[course] == 0])

            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:

*   Only numbers `1` through `9` are used.
*   Each number is used **at most once**.

Return _a list of all possible valid combinations_. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 3, n = 7
**Output:** \[\[1,2,4\]\]
**Explanation:**
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
There are no other valid combinations.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** k = 3, n = 9

Difficulty: Hard
Original Question: A city's **skyline** is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return _the **skyline** formed by these buildings collectively_.

The geometric information of each building is given in the array `buildings` where `buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]`:

*   `lefti` is the x coordinate of the left edge of the `ith` building.
*   `righti` is the x coordinate of the right edge of the `ith` building.
*   `heighti` is the height of the `ith` building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`.

The **skyline** should be represented as a list of "key points " **sorted by their x-coordinate** in the form `[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

**Note:** There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** buildings = \[\[2,9,10\],\[3,7,15\],\[5,12,12\],\[15,20,10\],\[19,24,8\]\]
**Output:** \[\[2,10\],\[3,15\],\[7,12\],\[12,0\],\[15,10\],\[20,8\],\[24,0\]\]

Figure A shows the buildings of the input.
Figure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in figure B represent the key points in the output list.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** buildings = \[\[0,2,3\],\[2,5,3\]\]

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\], indexDiff = 3, valueDiff = 0

Original Question: Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (`push`, `top`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyStack` class:

*   `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
*   `int pop()` Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
*   `int top()` Returns the element on the top of the stack.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the stack is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

*   You must use **only** standard operations of a queue, which means that only `push to back`, `peek/pop from front`, `size` and `is empty` operations are valid.
*   Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.

Original Question: Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyQueue` class:

*   `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
*   `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
*   `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

*   You must use **only** standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
*   Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "MyQueue ",  "push ",  "push ",  "peek ",  "pop ",  "empty "\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 1, 1, false\]

**Explanation**
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: \[1\]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: \[1, 2\] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is \[2\]
myQueue.empty(); // return false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= x <= 9`
*   At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`.
*   All the calls to `pop` and `peek` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the queue such that each operation is **[amortized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis)** `O(1)` time complexity? In other words, performing `n` operations will take overall `O(n)` time even if one of those operations may take longer.

*   `-1 <= Node.val <= 10`

**Follow up:** Could you do it in `O(n)` time and `O(0)` space?
CoT: **Solution:**

We can solve this problem in O(n) time and O(0) space by using two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the linked list. We will traverse the list from both ends towards the center, comparing the values of the nodes as we go.

Here is the Python code for the solution:

    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

        # Find the end of first half and reverse second half.
        first_half_end = self.end_of_first_half(head)
        second_half_start = self.reverse_list(first_half_end.next)

        # Check whether or not there's a palindrome.
        result = True
        first_position = head
        second_position = second_half_start
        while result and second_position is not None:
            if first_position.val!= second_position.val:
                result = False
            first_position = first_position.next
            second_position = second_position.next

        # Restore the list and return the result.
        first_half_end.next = self.reverse_list(second_half_start)
        return result

    def end_of_first_half(self, head):
        slow = head
        fast = head
        while fast.next is not None and fast.next.next is not None:

CoT: ### Solution

We can solve this problem using a recursive approach. The idea is to traverse the tree from the root node, and for each node, check if it is equal to either of the two given nodes. If it is, then this node is the LCA. If not, then we recursively check the left and right subtrees.

Original Question: There is a singly-linked list `head` and we want to delete a node `node` in it.

You are given the node to be deleted `node`. You will **not be given access** to the first node of `head`.

All the values of the linked list are **unique**, and it is guaranteed that the given node `node` is not the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

*   The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
*   The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
*   All the values before `node` should be in the same order.
*   All the values after `node` should be in the same order.

**Custom testing:**

*   For the input, you should provide the entire linked list `head` and the node to be given `node`. `node` should not be the last node of the list and should be an actual node in the list.
*   We will build the linked list and pass the node to your function.
*   The output will be the entire list after calling your function.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[4,5,1,9\], node = 5

We'll use a topological sorting algorithm to find the order of the letters in the alien language. If there's a cycle in the graph, it means the order is invalid, and we return an empty string.

Here's the Python code to solve the problem:
Response: python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def alienOrder(words):
    # Build the graph
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    in_degree = {char: 0 for word in words for char in word}

    for i in range(len(words) - 1):
        for char1, char2 in zip(words[i], words[i + 1]):
            if char1!= char2:
                graph[char1].append(char2)
                in_degree[char2] += 1
                break
        else:
            # If the words are equal, the shorter word comes first
            if len(words[i]) > len(words[i + 1]):
                return ""

    # Topological sorting
    queue = deque([char for char in in_degree if in_degree[char] == 0])
    result = []

    while queue:
        char = queue.popleft()
        result.append(char)

        for neighbor in graph[char]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)

    # If there are remaining nodes with non-zero in-degree, it means there's a cycle
    if len(result)!= len(in_degree):
        return ""

    return "".join(result)

# Example usage:
print(alienOrder(["wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"]))  # Output: "wertf"
print(alienOrder(["z", "x"]))  # Output: "zx"
print(alienOrder(["z", "x", "z"]))  # Output: ""

Original Question: Design an algorithm to encode **a list of strings** to **a string**. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Machine 1 (sender) has the function:

string encode(vector strs) {
  // ... your code
  return encoded\_string;
}

Machine 2 (receiver) has the function:

vector decode(string s) {
  //... your code
  return strs;
}

So Machine 1 does:

string encoded\_string = encode(strs);

and Machine 2 does:

vector strs2 = decode(encoded\_string);

`strs2` in Machine 2 should be the same as `strs` in Machine 1.

Implement the `encode` and `decode` methods.

You are not allowed to solve the problem using any serialize methods (such as `eval`).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** dummy\_input = \[ "Hello ", "World "\]
**Output:** \[ "Hello ", "World "\]
**Explanation:**
Machine 1:
Codec encoder = new Codec();
String msg = encoder.encode(strs);
Machine 1 ---msg---> Machine 2

Machine 2:
Codec decoder = new Codec();
String\[\] strs = decoder.decode(msg);

**Example 2:**

**Input:** dummy\_input = \[ " "\]
**Output:** \[ " "\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
*   `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
*   `strs[i]` contains any possible characters out of `256` valid ASCII characters.

**Follow up:** Could you write a generalized algorithm to work on any possible set of characters?

Original Question: Suppose you are at a party with `n` people labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other `n - 1` people know the celebrity, but the celebrity does not know any of them.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. You are only allowed to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B? " to get information about whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given a helper function `bool knows(a, b)` that tells you whether `a` knows `b`. Implement a function `int findCelebrity(n)`. There will be exactly one celebrity if they are at the party.

Return _the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity at the party_. If there is no celebrity, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[1,1,0\],\[0,1,0\],\[1,1,1\]\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph\[i\]\[j\] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph\[i\]\[j\] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[1,0,1\],\[1,1,0\],\[0,1,1\]\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There is no celebrity.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == graph.length == graph[i].length`
*   `2 <= n <= 100`
*   `graph[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
*   `graph[i][i] == 1`

**Follow up:** If the maximum number of allowed calls to the API `knows` is `3 * n`, could you find a solution without exceeding the maximum number of calls?

**Example 0:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[2,0,-1\],\[1,0,-1\],\[2,0,2\]\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There are three persons labeled with -1, 2 and 3. graph\[i\]\[j\] = 0 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph\[i\]\[j\] = -1 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 0 because both -1 and 1 know him but 0 does not know anybody.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[0,-1,2\],\[2,2,1\],\[1,0,2\]\]
**Output:** -0
**Explanation:** There is no celebrity.

*   `1 <= n <= 99`
*   `graph[i][j]` is `1` or `2`.
*   `graph[i][i] == 2`

**Follow up:** If the maximum number of allowed calls to the API `knows` is `2 * n`, could you find a solution without exceeding the maximum number of calls?
CoT: ### Solution

We can solve this problem by using a two-pointer technique. The idea is to use two pointers, `i` and `j`, starting from the beginning of the graph. We will move `j` to the right as long as `i` knows `j`. This way, `i` will be the potential celebrity, and `j` will be the person who knows `i` but is not known by `i`. If `i` knows `j`, then `j` is not a celebrity, and we can continue the search. If `j` knows `i`, then `i` is the celebrity.

Original Question: You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, bad = 4
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:**
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true

Original Question: Given two vectors of integers `v1` and `v2`, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

Implement the `ZigzagIterator` class:

*   `ZigzagIterator(List v1, List v2)` initializes the object with the two vectors `v1` and `v2`.
*   `boolean hasNext()` returns `true` if the iterator still has elements, and `false` otherwise.
*   `int next()` returns the current element of the iterator and moves the iterator to the next element.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1,2\], v2 = \[3,4,5,6\]
**Output:** \[1,3,2,4,5,6\]
**Explanation:** By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: \[1,3,2,4,5,6\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1\], v2 = \[\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** v1 = \[\], v2 = \[1\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

Original Question: Design an iterator that supports the `peek` operation on an existing iterator in addition to the `hasNext` and the `next` operations.

Implement the `PeekingIterator` class:

*   `PeekingIterator(Iterator nums)` Initializes the object with the given integer iterator `iterator`.
*   `int next()` Returns the next element in the array and moves the pointer to the next element.
*   `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there are still elements in the array.
*   `int peek()` Returns the next element in the array **without** moving the pointer.

**Note:** Each language may have a different implementation of the constructor and `Iterator`, but they all support the `int next()` and `boolean hasNext()` functions.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "PeekingIterator ",  "next ",  "peek ",  "next ",  "next ",  "hasNext "\]
\[\[\[1, 2, 3\]\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, 1, 2, 2, 3, false\]

**Explanation**
PeekingIterator peekingIterator = new PeekingIterator(\[1, 2, 3\]); // \[**1**,2,3\]
peekingIterator.next();    // return 1, the pointer moves to the next element \[1,**2**,3\].
peekingIterator.peek();    // return 2, the pointer does not move \[1,**2**,3\].
peekingIterator.next();    // return 2, the pointer moves to the next element \[1,2,**3**\]
peekingIterator.next();    // return 3, the pointer moves to the next element \[1,2,3\]
peekingIterator.hasNext(); // return False

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
*   All the calls to `next` and `peek` are valid.
*   At most `1000` calls will be made to `next`, `hasNext`, and `peek`.

**Follow up:** How would you extend your design to be generic and work with all types, not just integer?

There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return _this repeated number_.

You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and uses only constant extra space.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,2,3,1,1\]
**Output:** 1

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,2,2,5,3\]
**Output:** 4

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 104`
*   `nums.length == n + 2`
*   `2 <= nums[i] <= n`
*   All the integers in `nums` appear only **once** except for **precisely one integer** which appears **two or more** times.

**Follow up:**

*   How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
*   Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?
CoT: ### Solution

We can solve this problem using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection) algorithm. This algorithm is used to detect a cycle in a linked list, but it can also be used to find the duplicate number in this array.

The idea is to treat the array as a linked list where each index is a node and the value at that index is the value of the node. We then use two pointers, the tortoise and the hare, to traverse the list. The tortoise moves one step at a time, while the hare moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle in the list (which means there is a duplicate number), the hare will eventually meet the tortoise somewhere in the list.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:
Response: python
def findDuplicate(nums):
    """
    Find the duplicate number in the given array.

    Args:
    nums (list): The input array containing n + 2 integers where each integer is in the range [0, n] inclusive.

    Returns:
    int: The duplicate number in the array.
    """
    # Phase 1: Detecting the cycle using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm
    tortoise = nums[0]
    hare = nums[0]
    while True:
        tortoise = nums[tortoise]
        hare = nums[nums[hare]]
        if tortoise == hare:
            break

    # Phase 2: Finding the starting point of the cycle
    tortoise = nums[0]
    while tortoise!= hare:
        tortoise = nums[tortoise]
        hare = nums[hare]

    return hare

# Example usage:
nums = [2, 2, 3, 1, 1]
print(findDuplicate(nums))  # Output: 1

nums = [4, 2, 2, 5, 3]

Original Question: The **abbreviation** of a word is a concatenation of its first letter, the number of characters between the first and last letter, and its last letter. If a word has only two characters, then it is an **abbreviation** of itself.

For example:

*   `dog --> d1g` because there is one letter between the first letter `'d'` and the last letter `'g'`.
*   `internationalization --> i18n` because there are 18 letters between the first letter `'i'` and the last letter `'n'`.
*   `it --> it` because any word with only two characters is an **abbreviation** of itself.

Implement the `ValidWordAbbr` class:

*   `ValidWordAbbr(String[] dictionary)` Initializes the object with a `dictionary` of words.
*   `boolean isUnique(string word)` Returns `true` if **either** of the following conditions are met (otherwise returns `false`):
    *   There is no word in `dictionary` whose **abbreviation** is equal to `word`'s **abbreviation**.
    *   For any word in `dictionary` whose **abbreviation** is equal to `word`'s **abbreviation**, that word and `word` are **the same**.

Original Question: According to [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life): "The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. "

The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: **live** (represented by a `1`) or **dead** (represented by a `0`). Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, return _the next state_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[0,1,0\],\[0,0,1\],\[1,1,1\],\[0,0,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[0,0,0\],\[1,0,1\],\[0,1,1\],\[0,1,0\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\[1,1\],\[1,0\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 25`
*   `board[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

**Follow up:**

*   Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
*   In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

CoT: ### Solution

We can solve this problem by using a dictionary to store the mapping of characters to strings. We will iterate over the pattern and the string simultaneously, and for each character in the pattern, we will try to map it to a string in the dictionary. If the string in the dictionary matches the corresponding substring in the string, we will continue to the next character. If we can map all characters in the pattern to the string, we will return True. If we encounter a mismatch or a duplicate mapping, we will return False.

Original Question: You are playing a Flip Game with your friend.

You are given a string `currentState` that contains only `'+'` and `'-'`. You and your friend take turns to flip **two consecutive** `"++ "` into `"-- "`. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move, and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Return all possible states of the string `currentState` after **one valid move**. You may return the answer in **any order**. If there is no valid move, return an empty list `[]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** currentState =  "++++ "
**Output:** \[ "--++ ", "+--+ ", "++-- "\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** currentState =  "+ "
**Output:** \[\]

**Constraints:**

CoT: **Flip Game Solution**
=======================

The problem can be solved by analyzing the number of consecutive pairs of `++` in the `currentState` string. If the number of such pairs is odd, the starting player can guarantee a win by always flipping the middle pair. If the number of pairs is even, the starting player cannot guarantee a win because their friend can mirror their moves.

Here is the Python code for the solution:

Original Question: Given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where each `1` marks the home of one friend, return _the minimal **total travel distance**_.

The **total travel distance** is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.

The distance is calculated using [Manhattan Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), where `distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,0,0,0,1\],\[0,0,0,0,0\],\[0,0,1,0,0\]\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Given three friends living at (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2).
The point (0,2) is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 is minimal.
So return 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,1\]\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
*   There will be **at least two** friends in the `grid`.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[2,-1,-1,1,0\],\[1,-1,-1,1,1\],\[1,1,2,-1,1\]\]

**Explanation:** Given three friends living at (-1,1), (1,5), and (1,1).
The point (-1,1) is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance of 3 + 3 + 1 = 5 is minimal.

Original Question: You are playing the **[Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows)** game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

*   The number of "bulls ", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
*   The number of "cows ", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

Given the secret number `secret` and your friend's guess `guess`, return _the hint for your friend's guess_.

The hint should be formatted as `"xAyB "`, where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows. Note that both `secret` and `guess` may contain duplicate digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** secret =  "1807 ", guess =  "7810 "
**Output:**  "1A3B "
**Explanation:** Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
 "1807 "
  |
 "7810 "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** secret =  "1123 ", guess =  "0111 "
**Output:**  "1A1B "
**Explanation:** Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
 "1123 "         "1123 "
  |      or     |
 "0111 "         "0111 "
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000`
*   `secret.length == guess.length`
*   `secret` and `guess` consist of digits only.

Original Question: You are given an empty 2D binary grid `grid` of size `m x n`. The grid represents a map where `0`'s represent water and `1`'s represent land. Initially, all the cells of `grid` are water cells (i.e., all the cells are `0`'s).

We may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land. You are given an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [ri, ci]` is the position `(ri, ci)` at which we should operate the `ith` operation.

Return _an array of integers_ `answer` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the number of islands after turning the cell_ `(ri, ci)` _into a land_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 3, positions = \[\[0,0\],\[0,1\],\[1,2\],\[2,1\]\]
**Output:** \[1,1,2,3\]
**Explanation:**
Initially, the 2d grid is filled with water.
- Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid\[0\]\[0\] into a land. We have 1 island.
- Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid\[0\]\[1\] into a land. We still have 1 island.
- Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid\[1\]\[2\] into a land. We have 2 islands.
- Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid\[2\]\[1\] into a land. We have 3 islands.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 1, n = 1, positions = \[\[0,0\]\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= m, n, positions.length <= 104`
*   `1 <= m * n <= 104`
*   `positions[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= ri < m`
*   `0 <= ci < n`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it in time complexity `O(k log(mn))`, where `k == positions.length`?

Initially, the 3d grid is filled with water.
- Operation #2: addLand(1, 1) turns the water at grid\[1\]\[1\] into a land. We have 0 island.
- Operation #3: addLand(-1, 0) turns the water at grid\[-1\]\[2\] into a land. We still have 2 island.

Original Question: An **additive number** is a string whose digits can form an **additive sequence**.

A valid **additive sequence** should contain **at least** three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Given a string containing only digits, return `true` if it is an **additive number** or `false` otherwise.

**Note:** Numbers in the additive sequence **cannot** have leading zeros, so sequence `1, 2, 03` or `1, 02, 3` is invalid.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  "112358 "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8

**Example 2:**

**Input:**  "199100199 "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199.

Original Question: A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by _exactly_ one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`) are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs).

Return _a list of all **MHTs'** root labels_. You can return the answer in **any order**.

The **height** of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = \[\[1,0\],\[1,2\],\[1,3\]\]
**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.

CoT: ### Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree

We can solve this problem by using a queue to perform a level order traversal of the binary tree, and a dictionary to store the nodes at each column. The keys of the dictionary will be the column indices and the values will be lists of node values.
Response: python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

        # Initialize the dictionary to store nodes at each column
        column_nodes = defaultdict(list)
        
        # Initialize the minimum and maximum column indices
        min_col = 0
        max_col = 0

                node, col = queue.popleft()

        for col in range(min_col, max_col + 1):
            column_nodes[col].sort()

CoT: **Removing Duplicate Letters**
================================

We can solve this problem by using a stack data structure and a set to keep track of the characters we've seen so far. The idea is to always pop the character from the stack that is greater than the current character we're considering, because we want to keep the smallest possible result in lexicographical order.

Here's the Python code for this problem:
Response: python
from collections import Counter

def removeDuplicateLetters(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Removes duplicate letters from the input string so that every letter appears once and only once.
    The result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.

    Args:
    s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
    str: The resulting string with no duplicate letters.
    """
    # Count the frequency of each character in the string
    char_count = Counter(s)
    
    # Initialize a stack to store the characters
    stack = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # Decrement the count of the current character
        char_count[char] -= 1
        
        # If the current character is already in the stack, skip it
        if char in stack:
            continue
        
        # While the stack is not empty and the top character of the stack is greater than the current character
        # and the count of the top character is greater than 0, pop the top character from the stack
        while stack and stack[-1] > char and char_count[stack[-1]] > 0:
            stack.pop()
        
        # Push the current character onto the stack
        stack.append(char)
    
    # Join the characters in the stack to form the resulting string
