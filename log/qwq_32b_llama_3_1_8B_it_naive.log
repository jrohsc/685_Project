Original Question: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,7,11,15\], target = 9
**Output:** \[0,1\]
**Explanation:** Because nums\[0\] + nums\[1\] == 9, we return \[0, 1\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,4\], target = 6
**Output:** \[1,2\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,3\], target = 6
**Output:** \[0,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `-109 <= target <= 109`
*   **Only one valid answer exists.**

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find two numbers in the array that add up to a given target. We are to return the indices of these two numbers. The problem assumes that there is exactly one solution, and we cannot use the same element twice.

### Approach

1. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - The simplest way is to check all possible pairs of numbers in the array to see if they add up to the target.
   - This can be done using two nested loops.
   - However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not efficient for large arrays.

2. **Optimized Approach Using a Hash Map**:
   - We can use a hash map (dictionary in Python) to store the numbers and their indices as we iterate through the array.
   - For each number, we calculate the complement (target - current number).
   - We then check if this complement exists in the hash map.
   - If it does, we have found the two numbers and can return their indices.
   - If it does not, we store the current number and its index in the hash map.
   - This approach has a time complexity of O(n), which is much more efficient.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    num_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
    return []

Original Question: You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** l1 = \[2,4,3\], l2 = \[5,6,4\]
**Output:** \[7,0,8\]
**Explanation:** 342 + 465 = 807.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** l1 = \[0\], l2 = \[0\]
**Output:** \[0\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** l1 = \[9,9,9,9,9,9,9\], l2 = \[9,9,9,9\]
**Output:** \[8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
*   It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

*   It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to add two numbers that are represented by linked lists, where each node contains a single digit and the digits are stored in reverse order. We will iterate through both linked lists, add the corresponding digits along with any carry from the previous addition, and construct a new linked list for the result.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a dummy node to serve as the starting point of the result linked list.
   - Initialize a carry variable to 0.

2. **Iteration**:
   - Traverse both linked lists simultaneously, node by node.
   - At each step, calculate the sum of the current digits from both lists plus the carry.
   - Update the carry for the next iteration.
   - Create a new node with the digit being the sum modulo 10 and append it to the result linked list.

3. **Handling Unequal Lengths**:
   - If one linked list is longer than the other, continue the process with the remaining nodes and the carry.

4. **Final Carry**:
   - After processing all nodes, if there is still a carry, append a new node with the carry value to the result linked list.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the next node of the dummy node, which is the head of the result linked list.

Original Question: Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest** **substring** without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "abcabcbb "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The answer is  "abc ", with the length of 3.

**Example 2:**

**Explanation:** The answer is  "b ", with the length of 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "pwwkew "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The answer is  "wke ", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring,  "pwke " is a subsequence and not a substring.

*   `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
*   `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

*   `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string `s`. We can use the sliding window technique to efficiently solve this problem.

### Approach

1. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - We maintain a window defined by two pointers, `left` and `right`, which represent the current substring we are considering.
   - We use a set to keep track of the unique characters in the current window.
   - We move the `right` pointer to expand the window by including new characters.
   - If a character is already in the set, it means we have a repeating character. In this case, we move the `left` pointer to the right until the repeating character is removed from the window.
   - At each step, we update the maximum length of the substring without repeating characters.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is empty, the longest substring length is 0.
   - If the string has only one character, the longest substring length is 1.
   - If the string has all unique characters, the longest substring length is the length of the string.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:
    char_set = set()
    left = 0
    max_length = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):

            char_set.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        char_set.add(s[right])
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

    return max_length

Original Question: Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return **the median** of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,3\], nums2 = \[2\]
**Output:** 2.00000
**Explanation:** merged array = \[1,2,3\] and median is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,2\], nums2 = \[3,4\]
**Output:** 2.50000
**Explanation:** merged array = \[1,2,3,4\] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

**Constraints:**

*   `nums1.length == m`
*   `nums2.length == n`
*   `0 <= m <= 1000`
*   `0 <= n <= 1000`
*   `1 <= m + n <= 2000`

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the median of two sorted arrays efficiently. The challenge is to achieve this in O(log(m+n)) time complexity, which suggests that a simple merge of the arrays followed by finding the median (O(m+n) time) is not sufficient. Instead, we need a more optimized approach.

### Approach

1. **Understand the Median Calculation**:
   - The median is the middle value in an ordered list of numbers.
   - If the total number of elements is odd, the median is the middle element.
   - If even, it is the average of the two middle elements.

2. **Binary Search on Partition**:
   - We can use a binary search approach to find the correct partition between the two arrays.
   - The partition should divide the combined array into two halves, with the left half containing the smaller half of the numbers and the right half containing the larger half.
   - The median can then be determined based on the maximum of the left partition and the minimum of the right partition.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - One of the arrays could be empty.
   - Arrays could have different lengths.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2):
    # Ensure nums1 is the smaller array to optimize the binary search
    if len(nums1) > len(nums2):
        nums1, nums2 = nums2, nums1
    m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)
    imin, imax = 0, m
    half_len = (m + n + 1) // 2

    while imin <= imax:
        i = (imin + imax) // 2
        j = half_len - i

        if i < m and nums2[j-1] > nums1[i]:
            # i is too small, must increase it
            imin = i + 1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
*   `s` consist of only digits and English letters.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string `s`. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

### Approach

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - Check all possible substrings and verify if they are palindromes.
   - Keep track of the longest palindrome found.
   - Time Complexity: O(n^3), since checking each substring is O(n^2) and verifying palindrome is O(n).

2. **Optimized Approach: Expand Around Center**
   - Consider each character (and each pair of characters for even-length palindromes) as potential centers of palindromes.
   - Expand around these centers to find the maximum length palindrome.
   - Time Complexity: O(n^2), as we iterate through each character and expand around it.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Use a table to store results of subproblems.
   - Fill the table in a bottom-up manner to check for palindromes.
   - Time Complexity: O(n^2).

Given the constraints (1 <= s.length <= 1000), an O(n^2) solution is acceptable and efficient.

**Example 3:**

**Output:** 21

**Constraints:**

*   `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to reverse the digits of a given 32-bit signed integer `x` and handle cases where the reversed integer might overflow the 32-bit signed integer range.

### Approach

1. **Handling Negative Numbers:** Check if the number is negative. If it is, we'll reverse the absolute value and then apply the negative sign to the result.
2. **Reversing Digits:** Convert the integer to a string, reverse the string, and then convert it back to an integer.
3. **Checking for Overflow:** Before returning the result, check if the reversed integer is within the 32-bit signed integer range (`-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`). If it's outside this range, return 0.

Original Question: Given an integer `x`, return `true` _if_ `x` _is a_ _**palindrome**__, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** x = 121
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = -121
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** x = 10
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Constraints:**

*   `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

**Constraints:**

*   `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given integer is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, 121 is a palindrome, while -121 and 10 are not.

### Approach

1. **Negative Numbers:** Negative numbers are not palindromes because the negative sign affects the reading direction.
2. **Single-Digit Numbers:** Single-digit numbers are always palindromes.
3. **Reversing the Number:** For positive numbers, we can reverse the number and check if it is equal to the original number.

### Solution Code

Original Question: Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where:

*   `'.'` Matches any single character.​​​​
*   `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "aa ", p =  "a "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:**  "a " does not match the entire string  "aa ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "aa ", p =  "a\* "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** '\*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes  "aa ".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "ab ", p =  ".\* "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**  ".\* " means  "zero or more (\*) of any character (.) ".

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 20`
*   `1 <= p.length <= 20`
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
*   `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'.'`, and `'*'`.
*   It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character `'*'`, there will be a previous valid character to match.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to implement a regular expression matcher that supports '.' and '*' operators. The '.' matches any single character, while '*' allows for zero or more occurrences of the preceding character.

### Approach
We'll use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently. The idea is to build a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` indicates whether the first `i` characters of the string `s` match the first `j` characters of the pattern `p`.

Original Question: You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

*   `0 <= height[i] <= 104`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find two lines that, together with the x-axis, form a container that holds the most water. The amount of water that can be contained between two lines is determined by the distance between them (width) and the height of the shorter line, since the water is limited by the shorter line.

### Approach

1. **Initial Considerations:**
   - We are given an array `height` where each element represents the height of a vertical line at a specific index.
   - The goal is to find two lines that can form a container with the maximum possible water volume.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The volume of water that can be contained between two lines is determined by the minimum height between the two lines multiplied by the distance between them.
   - To maximize the volume, we need to consider both the height and the width.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Use a two-pointer approach starting from both ends of the array.
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` at the start (index 0) and `right` at the end (index n-1).
   - Calculate the area formed by the lines at `left` and `right`.
   - Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line towards the other pointer.
   - Repeat the process, updating the maximum area found, until the pointers meet.

4. **Reasoning:**
   - By starting with the widest possible container (pointers at both ends), we maximize the width.
   - Moving the pointer at the shorter line towards the other pointer allows us to potentially find a taller line that can increase the area.
   - This approach ensures that we efficiently check possible combinations without needing to check every pair of lines, thus optimizing time complexity.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def maxArea(height):
    max_area = 0
    left = 0
    right = len(height) - 1

Original Question: Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

**Symbol**       **Value**
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

*   `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
*   `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
*   `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = 3
**Output:**  "III "
**Explanation:** 3 is represented as 3 ones.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = 58
**Output:**  "LVIII "

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num <= 3999`
CoT: To solve the problem of converting an integer to a Roman numeral, we need to understand the rules of Roman numeral representation. Roman numerals are constructed by combining letters from the Latin alphabet, each of which corresponds to a specific value. The key rules are:

1. **Basic Symbols and Values:**
   - I: 1
   - V: 5
   - X: 10
   - L: 50
   - C: 100
   - D: 500
   - M: 1000

2. **Additive Notation:**
   - Symbols are placed from left to right in order of value, starting with the largest.
   - Values are added together; for example, `III` is 3 (1 + 1 + 1), and `XXVII` is 27 (10 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1).

3. **Subtractive Notation:**
   - To avoid four characters being repeated in succession (such as `IIII` for 4), subtractive notation is used.
   - `I` before `V` or `X` indicates one less, so `IV` is 4 (5 - 1), and `IX` is 9 (10 - 1).
   - `X` before `L` or `C` indicates ten less, so `XL` is 40 (50 - 10), and `XC` is 90 (100 - 10).
   - `C` before `D` or `M` indicates one hundred less, so `CD` is 400 (500 - 100), and `CM` is 900 (1000 - 100).

Given these rules, our approach will be to repeatedly subtract the largest possible Roman numeral value from the given integer and append the corresponding Roman numeral symbol to the result string until the integer is reduced to zero.

### Approach

1. **Create Mappings:**
   - Define two lists: one for the integer values and another for the corresponding Roman numeral symbols.
   - Include values for subtractive notations (e.g., 4 for `IV`, 9 for `IX`, 40 for `XL`, etc.).

2. **Build the Roman Numeral:**
   - Iterate through the values from largest to smallest.
   - While the given number is greater than or equal to the current value:
     - Subtract the value from the number.
     - Append the corresponding Roman numeral symbol to the result string.
   - Continue this process until the number is reduced to zero.

CoT: So I've got this problem to convert Roman numerals to integers.

There are six instances where subtraction is used: IV (4), IX (9), XL (40), XC (90), CD (400), and CM (900).

First, I need to figure out how to map the Roman symbols to their integer values. I think the best way is to use a dictionary in Python, where the keys are the Roman symbols and the values are their corresponding integer values.

So, I'll create a dictionary like this:
Response: python
roman_values = {
    'I': 1,
    'V': 5,
    'X': 10,
    'L': 50,

CoT: Alright, I have this problem to solve: finding the longest common prefix among an array of strings. If there's no common prefix, I should return an empty string. Let's see how I can approach this.

First, I need to understand what a prefix is. A prefix of a string is the beginning part of it. For example, in "flower", "fl" is a prefix. So, the longest common prefix among an array of strings would be the longest such beginning part that all strings share.

Looking at the first example:

Input: strs = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]

Output: "fl"

All three strings start with "fl", and that's the longest common part.

In the second example:

Input: strs = ["dog", "racecar", "car"]

Output: ""

There's no common prefix because the strings don't share the same starting characters.

Alright, so I need to find the longest common starting substring among all strings in the array.

Let me think about how to implement this in Python.

One way is to iterate through the characters of the first string and check if those characters are present at the same positions in all other strings. I can stop at the first position where a mismatch occurs.

But I need to handle some edge cases:

1. If the array is empty, should return an empty string. But according to the constraints, strs.length >= 1, so I don't need to handle an empty array.

2. If there's only one string, the entire string is the common prefix.

3. If some strings are empty, the common prefix should be empty.

4. All strings are identical; the common prefix would be the entire string.

5. Strings have different lengths; the common prefix can't be longer than the shortest string.

So, I should find the minimum length among all strings because the common prefix can't exceed that length.

Here's a plan:

- Find the minimum length among all strings in strs.

- Iterate through the characters from index 0 to min_length - 1.

- For each index, check if all strings have the same character at that position.

- If they do, add that character to the result.

- If not, stop and return the accumulated prefix.

- If all characters match up to min_length, return that as the prefix.

- If no characters match, return an empty string.

Let me think about the implementation step by step.

First, find the minimum length:

min_len = min(len(s) for s in strs)

Then, iterate from 0 to min_len - 1:

for i in range(min_len):

    # Check if all strings have the same character at position i

    char = strs[0][i]

    for s in strs:

        if s[i]!= char:

            return strs[0][:i]

If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, return strs[0][:min_len]

Wait, there's a small issue here. If all characters match up to min_len, I should return that. Also, I need to handle the case where min_len is 0, which would mean at least one string is empty, so the common prefix is empty.

Let me adjust the plan:

- Find the minimum length among all strings.

- If min_len is 0, return ""

- Otherwise, iterate through indices 0 to min_len - 1:

- For each index, check if all strings have the same character at that position.

- If a mismatch is found at index i, return the substring from 0 to i.

- If no mismatch is found, return the substring from 0 to min_len.

Also, I should consider that the array has at least one string, as per constraints.

Let me try to write some pseudocode:

def longestCommonPrefix(strs):

    if not strs:

        return ""

    min_len = min(len(s) for s in strs)

    for i in range(min_len):

        char = strs[0][i]

        for s in strs:

            if s[i]!= char:

                return strs[0][:i]

    return strs[0][:min_len]

Let me test this pseudocode with the first example:

strs = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]

min_len = 2 (minimum length among the strings)

Iterate i from 0 to 1:

i=0:

char = 'f'

Check if 'f' == 'f' == 'f' -> yes

i=1:

char = 'l'

Check if 'l' == 'l' == 'l' -> yes

No mismatches, so return strs[0][:2] = "fl"

Correct.

Second example:

strs = ["dog", "racecar", "car"]

min_len = 3

i=0:

char = 'd'

"racecar"[0] = 'r'!= 'd' -> mismatch at i=0

Return strs[0][:0] = ""

Correct.

Another test case:

strs = ["abc", "ab", "abcde"]

min_len = 2

i=0:

char = 'a'

All strings start with 'a'

i=1:

char = 'b'

All strings have 'b' at position 1

No mismatch, return strs[0][:2] = "ab"

Correct.

Edge case:

strs = ["a"]

min_len = 1

Return "a"

Correct.

Edge case:

strs = ["", ""]

min_len = 0

Return ""

Correct.

Edge case:

strs = ["abc", "", "abd"]

min_len = 0 (since one empty string)

Return ""

Correct.

Seems like this approach works for these cases.

Now, let's think about optimizing it. Is there a way to make it more efficient?

Well, the time complexity is O(S), where S is the total number of characters in all strings, because in the worst case, we might need to look at each character.

But in practice, we might stop early if a mismatch is found.

Space complexity is O(1), since we're only storing a few variables.

Alternatively, I could sort the strings and compare only the first and last strings, since the common prefix of the entire array would be the common prefix of the smallest and largest strings.

Let's think about that.

If I sort the strings:

- The first string would be the smallest lexicographically.

- The last string would be the largest lexicographically.

- The common prefix between these two would be the common prefix for the entire array.

For example:

strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]

Sorted: ["flight","flow","flower"]

First: "flight"

Last: "flower"

Common prefix: "fl"

Which is correct.

Another example:

strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]

Sorted: ["car","dog","racecar"]

First: "car"

Last: "racecar"

Common prefix: ""

Which is correct.

This seems like a better approach because it reduces the number of comparisons. Instead of comparing each string to the first string, I only compare the first and last strings after sorting.

The time complexity for sorting is O(N log N), where N is the number of strings, and assuming the average length of strings is M, the sorting comparison would take O(M) time. So overall, O(N M log N).

But in the previous approach, the time complexity is O(N M), since in the worst case, we might look at each character of each string.

So, the first approach is more efficient in terms of time complexity.

However, in practice, if the number of strings is small, the difference might not be significant.

But according to the constraints, N can be up to 200, and M up to 200, so O(N M) is 40,000 operations, which is acceptable.

I think the first approach is sufficient and more efficient.

But let's see if there's another way.

Another approach could be to use the built-in zip function in Python to group characters at the same positions and then find the characters that are the same across all strings.

For example:

strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]

zip(*strs) would give:

('f', 'f', 'f')

('l', 'l', 'l')

('o', 'o', 'i')

('w', 'w', 'g')

So, the first two groups have all 'f' and 'l', but the third group has 'o', 'o', 'i' which are not all the same.

So, the common prefix is "fl".

This can be implemented as:

def longestCommonPrefix(strs):

    prefix = []

    for char_group in zip(*strs):

        if all(char == char_group[0] for char in char_group):

            prefix.append(char_group[0])

        else:

            break

    return ''.join(prefix)

This is quite clean and Pythonic.

Let's test it with the first example:

strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]

zip(*strs): [('f', 'f', 'f'), ('l', 'l', 'l'), ('o', 'o', 'i'), ('w', 'w', 'g'),...]

First two groups have all matching characters, third doesn't, so prefix = ['f','l'] -> "fl"

Correct.

Second example:

strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]

zip(*strs): [('d', 'r', 'c'), ('o', 'a', 'a'), ('g', 'c', 'r'),...]

First group doesn't have matching characters, so prefix = []

Return ""

Correct.

This approach also seems good.

Time complexity: O(N M), where N is the number of strings and M is the minimum length.

Space complexity: O(M), since we store the prefix list.

This is acceptable given the constraints.

I think this is a good solution.

I can also handle the case where the array is empty, but according to constraints, N >= 1.

I should also handle cases where some strings are empty.

In the zip(*strs) approach, if one string is empty, the zip will stop at the shortest string, which is correct, as the common prefix would be empty.

For example:

strs = ["a", ""]

zip(*strs): []

So, prefix = [] -> ""

Correct.

Another case:

strs = ["abc", "ab", "abcd"]

zip(*strs): [('a', 'a', 'a'), ('b', 'b', 'b'), ('c', '', 'c')]

First two groups match, third doesn't (because ''), so prefix = ['a','b'] -> "ab"

Correct.

Seems solid.

I can proceed with this implementation.

Just to be thorough, let's think about any potential issues.

- All strings are identical: e.g., ["abc", "abc", "abc"] -> "abc" Correct.

- Strings have different lengths, but share a common prefix: e.g., ["abc", "ab", "abcd"] -> "ab" Correct.

- Strings have no common prefix: e.g., ["abc", "def", "ghi"] -> "" Correct.

- Array with one string: e.g., ["abc"] -> "abc" Correct.

- Array with empty strings: e.g., ["", "", ""] -> "" Correct.

- Array with some empty strings: e.g., ["abc", "", "def"] -> "" Correct.

I think this covers most cases.

Now, I need to write the function accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the longest common prefix among an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, we should return an empty string.

### Approach
1. **Intuition**: The longest common prefix can be determined by comparing characters at the same indices across all strings in the array.
2. **Method**:
   - Use the `zip` function to group characters from each string at the same index.
   - Convert each group of characters to a set to check if they are all identical.
   - Continue building the prefix until a mismatch is found.
3. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(N * M), where N is the number of strings and M is the minimum length of strings in the array.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(M), where M is the minimum length of strings in the array.

CoT: To solve the "3Sum" problem in Python, we need to find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero. The challenge here is to efficiently find these triplets without exceeding time limits, especially given the constraints of the problem.

### Approach

1. **Sorting the Array**: 
   - Sorting the array makes it easier to avoid duplicates and use the two-pointer technique.
   
2. **Using Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - For each number in the array, treat it as the first element of the triplet.
   - Then, use two pointers (left and right) to find pairs that sum up to the negative of the first element.
   
3. **Avoiding Duplicates**:
   - Skip over duplicate values to ensure that the triplets are unique.
   - This is done by checking if the current value is the same as the previous one.

*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `-109 <= target <= 109`
CoT: To solve the "4Sum" problem, we need to find all unique quadruplets in the array that sum up to the given target. This is an extension of the "3Sum" problem, which itself is an extension of the "2Sum" problem. We can approach this problem by extending the techniques used in the "3Sum" problem, primarily involving sorting and the two-pointer technique.

### Approach

1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting the array makes it easier to avoid duplicates and use the two-pointer technique.
2. **Four Pointers**: We will use four pointers to represent the quadruplets. To reduce complexity, we will fix two pointers and use the two-pointer technique for the remaining two.
3. **Avoid Duplicates**: Since we need unique quadruplets, we will skip over duplicates while moving the pointers.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

- **Step 1**: Sort the array.
- **Step 2**: Iterate through the array with the first pointer `a`.
- **Step 3**: For each `a`, iterate with the second pointer `b` starting from `a + 1`.
- **Step 4**: For each pair `(a, b)`, use two pointers `c` and `d` starting from `b + 1` and `n - 1` respectively.
- **Step 5**: Calculate the sum of the four elements. If the sum is equal to the target, add the quadruplet to the result and move both pointers while skipping duplicates. If the sum is less than the target, move the `c` pointer to the right. If the sum is greater, move the `d` pointer to the left.
- **Step 6**: Skip duplicates for both `a` and `b` pointers to ensure uniqueness.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to remove the nth node from the end of a linked list in a single pass. We'll achieve this by using a two-pointer technique.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We'll use two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, both starting at a dummy node before the head. This dummy node helps handle cases where the head itself needs to be removed.
   
2. **Positioning Pointers**:
   - Move the `fast` pointer `n` steps ahead of the `slow` pointer.
   
3. **Moving Pointers Together**:
   - Then, move both pointers simultaneously until the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list.
   - At this point, the `slow` pointer will be just before the node that needs to be removed.
   
4. **Removing the Node**:
   - Adjust the pointers to skip the nth node from the end.

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets we encounter. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize a stack:** We'll use a list to simulate a stack.

2. **Define matching pairs:** We need a way to check if a closing bracket matches the last opening bracket. We can use a dictionary to map opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets.

3. **Iterate through each character in the string:**
   - If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
   - If it's a closing bracket, check if it matches the last opening bracket on the stack. If it does, pop the opening bracket from the stack. If it doesn't match or there's no opening bracket on the stack, return `False`.

4. **Check the stack at the end:** If the stack is empty, all brackets were properly closed; otherwise, return `False`.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:
Response: python
def is_valid(s):
    # Define a mapping from opening to closing brackets
    bracket_map = {'(': ')', '[': ']', '{': '}'}
    # Initialize an empty stack

                return False
    # If stack is empty, all brackets were properly closed
    return len(stack) == 0

*   Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list. The key points to consider are:

1. Both input linked lists are already sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. We need to splice the nodes from both lists to form a new sorted list.
3. Handle cases where one or both lists are empty.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a dummy node to serve as the starting point of the merged list. This helps in easily managing the head of the new list.
   - Use a current pointer to track the current end of the merged list.

2. **Merging Process**:
   - Compare the values of the nodes from both lists.
   - Append the smaller value node to the merged list and move the pointer of that list to the next node.
   - Move the current pointer of the merged list to the newly added node.
   - Repeat this process until one of the lists is exhausted.

3. **Handling Remaining Nodes**:
   - If one list is exhausted and the other still has nodes, append the remaining nodes of the non-exhausted list to the merged list.

4. **Return the Merged List**:
   - The merged list starts from the next of the dummy node.

**Example 2:**

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 8`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses given `n` pairs. A well-formed parentheses combination means that each opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')' and that they are properly nested.

### Approach

We can use a backtracking approach to build the combinations step by step. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We'll use a list to store the valid combinations.
   - We'll define a recursive function that builds the combinations by adding parentheses one by one.

2. **Backtracking Function**:
   - The function will take the current combination, the number of opening parentheses used, and the number of closing parentheses used.
   - At each step, we can decide to add an opening parenthesis if we haven't used all `n` opening parentheses.
   - We can add a closing parenthesis only if it won't lead to a mismatch (i.e., the number of closing parentheses doesn't exceed the number of opening parentheses used so far).

3. **Base Case**:
   - If the length of the current combination is `2*n`, we have a valid combination, so we add it to the result list.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to merge multiple sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list. Given that each individual list is already sorted, we can leverage this property to efficiently merge them.

### Approach

1. **Priority Queue (Min-Heap):** Use a min-heap to keep track of the smallest elements from each list. This way, we can always pick the smallest element available across all lists efficiently.

2. **Initialization:** Insert the head of each non-empty list into the min-heap. Each entry in the heap should contain the value of the node and a reference to the node itself to handle duplicates properly.

3. **Merging Process:** 
   - Pop the smallest element from the heap and add it to the result list.
   - If the popped node has a next node, insert the next node into the heap.
   - Repeat this process until the heap is empty.

*   `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

**Follow-up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra memory space?
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to reverse the nodes of a linked list in groups of size `k`. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k`, the remaining nodes at the end should remain as they are.

### Approach

1. **Check if reversal is needed:** First, we need to check if there are at least `k` nodes left in the list before performing a reversal. If there are fewer than `k` nodes left, we should leave the remaining nodes as they are.
2. **Reverse a group of k nodes:** We will use a standard linked list reversal technique to reverse `k` nodes at a time.
3. **Connect the reversed group to the previous part of the list:** After reversing a group, we need to connect it to the previously reversed group or to the head of the list.
4. **Iterate through the list in steps of k nodes:** We will continue this process until fewer than `k` nodes are left in the list.

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**. Then return _the number of unique elements in_ `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

*   Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
*   Return `k`.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array
int\[\] expectedNums = \[...\]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums\[i\] == expectedNums\[i\];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,2\]
**Output:** 2, nums = \[1,2,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4\]
**Output:** 5, nums = \[0,1,2,3,4,\_,\_,\_,\_,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`

CoT: I've got this problem to solve. So, I have an array of integers that's sorted in non-decreasing order, and I need to remove the duplicates in-place, meaning I shouldn't create a new array. I need to modify the original array such that only unique elements are kept, and they should remain in their original relative order. Then, I have to return the number of unique elements.

Let me try to understand this with the first example:

nums = [1,1,2]

After removing duplicates, it should be [1,2], and the function should return 2.

Another example:

nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]

After removing duplicates, it should be [0,1,2,3,4], and the function should return 5.

Okay, so I need to modify the array in-place, which means I should probably use some sort of pointer or index to keep track of where to place the next unique element.

Since the array is sorted, duplicates will be adjacent to each other. So, I can iterate through the array and compare each element with the previous one to check if it's a duplicate.

I think I can maintain a separate index that keeps track of the position where the next unique element should be placed.

Let's think about the steps:

1. If the array is empty, return 0 because there are no elements.

2. If the array has only one element, it's already unique, so return 1.

3. For arrays with more than one element, start iterating from the second element.

4. Compare each element with the previous one.

5. If the current element is different from the previous one, it's a unique element, and I should place it at the next position in the array.

6. Keep track of the position where the next unique element should be placed.

7. After processing all elements, the number of unique elements will be the index of the last unique element plus one.

Let me try to write this in code.

First, handle the edge cases:

if not nums:

return 0

if len(nums) == 1:

return 1

Now, initialize a variable to keep track of the position for the next unique element. Let's call it "unique_index" and set it to 0.

unique_index = 0

Then, iterate through the array starting from the second element (index 1).

for i in range(1, len(nums)):

if nums[i]!= nums[unique_index]:

unique_index += 1

nums[unique_index] = nums[i]

Finally, return unique_index + 1, since the number of unique elements is one more than the index.

Wait, in programming, indices start from 0, so if unique_index is 0, there's one unique element; if it's 1, there are two, and so on.

So, the function would look like this:

def removeDuplicates(nums):

if not nums:

return 0

unique_index = 0

for i in range(1, len(nums)):

if nums[i]!= nums[unique_index]:

unique_index += 1

nums[unique_index] = nums[i]

return unique_index + 1

Let me test this with the first example:

nums = [1,1,2]

unique_index starts at 0

i=1: nums[1]=1 == nums[0]=1 → skip

i=2: nums[2]=2!= nums[0]=1 → unique_index +=1 → unique_index=1

nums[1]=2

return 1+1=2

So, nums is now [1,2], and k=2. That's correct.

Second example:

nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]

unique_index=0

i=1: nums[1]=0 == nums[0]=0 → skip

i=2: nums[2]=1!= nums[0]=0 → unique_index=1, nums[1]=1

i=3: nums[3]=1 == nums[1]=1 → skip

i=4: nums[4]=1 == nums[1]=1 → skip

i=5: nums[5]=2!= nums[1]=1 → unique_index=2, nums[2]=2

i=6: nums[6]=2 == nums[2]=2 → skip

i=7: nums[7]=3!= nums[2]=2 → unique_index=3, nums[3]=3

i=8: nums[8]=3 == nums[3]=3 → skip

i=9: nums[9]=4!= nums[3]=3 → unique_index=4, nums[4]=4

return 4+1=5

So, nums is now [0,1,2,3,4], and k=5. Perfect.

I think this should work. The time complexity is O(n), which is efficient for the given constraints.

One thing to note is that the problem says it's okay to have anything beyond the first k elements. So, in the modified array, elements after the k-th position can be anything, and they won't be checked.

I should also consider the constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4

- -100 <= nums[i] <= 100

- nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

My solution should work within these constraints.

Let me think about any possible edge cases:

1. All elements are the same:

nums = [1,1,1,1,1]

After removal, nums should be [1], k=1

2. All elements are unique:

nums = [1,2,3,4,5]

After removal, nums remains the same, k=5

3. Single element array:

nums = [1]

After removal, nums remains [1], k=1

4. Empty array:

nums = []

After removal, k=0

Wait, but in the constraints, 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4, so empty array might not be considered. But in my code, I handle it by returning 0.

5. Array with negative numbers:

nums = [-100, -100, -99, -99, 0, 0, 100, 100]

After removal, nums = [-100, -99, 0, 100], k=4

6. Array with maximum size:

nums = [1] * (3 * 10**4)

Should return k=1

nums = list(range(3 * 10**4))

Should return k=3 * 10**4

I think my code handles all these cases correctly.

I can also think about the space complexity. Since I'm modifying the array in-place, the space complexity is O(1), which is acceptable.

I don't think there's a need for optimizing further, as O(n) time and O(1) space is efficient enough for the given constraints.

So, I'm confident this solution is correct.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same, and we need to return the number of unique elements.

## Approach
1. **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - If the array is empty, return 0.
    - If the array has only one element, return 1.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
    - Use one pointer (`unique_index`) to track the position of the last unique element found.
    - Iterate through the array with another pointer (`i`), starting from the second element.
    - If the current element (`nums[i]`) is different from the element at `unique_index`, it is a unique element.
    - Increment `unique_index` and update `nums[unique_index]` with the new unique element.

3. **Return the Count of Unique Elements**:
    - The number of unique elements is `unique_index + 1`.

## Solution Code

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm). The order of the elements may be changed. Then return _the number of elements in_ `nums` _which are not equal to_ `val`.

Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

*   Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int\[\] expectedNums = \[...\]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

CoT: Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers called `nums` and another integer `val`. I need to remove all occurrences of `val` from `nums` in-place, which means I shouldn't create a new array; I have to modify the original array directly. After removing all instances of `val`, I should return the new length of the array, which is the count of elements not equal to `val`. Also, the first part of the array up to this new length should contain all the elements that are not equal to `val`, and the rest of the array can be anything.

Okay, so in-place modification. That means I need to manipulate the array without using extra space for another array. Probably, I should think about shifting elements around or overwriting certain positions.

Let me think about examples to understand better.

First example:

nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3

After removal, it should be [2,2], and the length is 2.

Second example:

nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2

After removal, it should be [0,1,3,0,4], and the length is 5.

Note that the order of the elements doesn't matter as long as the first k elements are not equal to val.

So, one way to approach this is to have two pointers: one for iterating through the array and another for placing elements that are not equal to val.

Let me consider using a pointer `k` that keeps track of the position where the next non-val element should be placed.

Initialize `k` to 0.

Then, iterate through the array with another pointer `i` from 0 to len(nums)-1.

If nums[i] is not equal to val, place nums[i] at nums[k], and increment k.

This way, all elements from nums[0] to nums[k-1] will be not equal to val, and k will be the new length.

Yes, that sounds good.

Let me try this logic with the first example:

nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3

Initialize k=0

i=0: nums[0]=3 == val, skip

i=1: nums[1]=2!= val, set nums[k=0]=2, k=1

i=2: nums[2]=2!= val, set nums[k=1]=2, k=2

i=3: nums[3]=3 == val, skip

Return k=2, and the array is [2,2,2,3]. But according to the problem, it's okay to have anything beyond the first k elements, so [2,2,_,_] is fine.

Second example:

nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2

Initialize k=0

i=0: nums[0]=0!= val, set nums[0]=0, k=1

i=1: nums[1]=1!= val, set nums[1]=1, k=2

i=2: nums[2]=2 == val, skip

i=3: nums[3]=2 == val, skip

i=4: nums[4]=3!= val, set nums[2]=3, k=3

i=5: nums[5]=0!= val, set nums[3]=0, k=4

i=6: nums[6]=4!= val, set nums[4]=4, k=5

i=7: nums[7]=2 == val, skip

Return k=5, and the array is [0,1,3,0,4,0,4,2]. Again, beyond the first 5 elements, it's irrelevant.

This seems correct.

Now, what if the array is empty?

nums = [], val = 1

Then, k=0, and the array remains empty.

What if all elements are equal to val?

nums = [1,1,1], val = 1

Then, k=0, and the array can be left as is.

What if no elements are equal to val?

nums = [2,3,4], val = 1

Then, k=3, and the array remains [2,3,4].

What if nums contains only one element equal to val?

nums = [5], val = 5

Then, k=0, and the array can be left as is.

What if nums contains multiple instances of val interspersed?

nums = [1,2,3,2,4,2], val=2

Then, k=3, and the array should have [1,3,4,2,4,2]. The first three elements are not 2, and the rest can be anything.

This seems consistent.

Now, let's think about the implementation.

I need to iterate through the array with index i from 0 to len(nums)-1.

Maintain another index k, starting from 0.

Whenever nums[i]!= val, set nums[k] = nums[i] and increment k.

At the end, return k.

This is straightforward.

In terms of code, it would look like:

def removeElement(nums, val):

k = 0

for i in range(len(nums)):

if nums[i]!= val:

nums[k] = nums[i]

k += 1

return k

But wait, in Python, arrays are passed by reference, so modifying nums in-place should be fine.

Let me test this logic with the examples.

First example:

nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3

After execution:

i=0: nums[0]=3 == val, skip

i=1: nums[1]=2!= val, nums[0]=2, k=1

i=2: nums[2]=2!= val, nums[1]=2, k=2

i=3: nums[3]=3 == val, skip

Return k=2, nums=[2,2,2,3]

Which is correct.

Second example:

nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2

After execution:

i=0: nums[0]=0!= val, nums[0]=0, k=1

i=1: nums[1]=1!= val, nums[1]=1, k=2

i=2: nums[2]=2 == val, skip

i=3: nums[3]=2 == val, skip

i=4: nums[4]=3!= val, nums[2]=3, k=3

i=5: nums[5]=0!= val, nums[3]=0, k=4

i=6: nums[6]=4!= val, nums[4]=4, k=5

i=7: nums[7]=2 == val, skip

Return k=5, nums=[0,1,3,0,4,0,4,2]

Correct again.

Edge cases:

nums = [], val = 1

k=0, nums remains []

nums = [1], val = 1

k=0, nums can be [1]

nums = [2], val = 1

k=1, nums=[2]

nums = [1,1,1], val=1

k=0, nums=[1,1,1]

nums = [1,2,3,2,4,2], val=2

k=3, nums=[1,3,4,2,4,2]

All seem correct.

I think this approach is solid. It's efficient, with O(n) time complexity since it iterates through the array once, and O(1) space complexity because it modifies the array in-place without using extra space.

I don't think there's a need for a two-pointer approach where one pointer is moving from the end, as this simple approach suffices.

Also, since the problem allows the order of the first k elements to be irrelevant, we don't need to maintain the original order, which makes this approach even more suitable.

I should also consider the constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 100

0 <= nums[i] <= 50

0 <= val <= 100

So, the array can be empty, and the values are within a small range.

I don't think there are any corner cases I'm missing.

I can proceed to implement this function.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to remove all occurrences of a given value `val` from an integer array `nums` in-place and return the new length of the array after removal. The order of the elements is not important, and elements beyond the new length can be ignored.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: Use a pointer `k` to track the position for the next non-val element in the array.
2. **Iteration**: Traverse the array with another pointer `i`. If the element at `i` is not equal to `val`, place it at the position `k` and increment `k`.
3. **Result**: The pointer `k` will represent the count of elements not equal to `val`, which is the new length of the array.

This approach ensures that the first `k` elements of the array are all the elements not equal to `val`, and it modifies the array in-place as required.

### Solution Code

    k = 0

The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** haystack =  "leetcode ", needle =  "leeto "
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**  "leeto " did not occur in  "leetcode ", so we return -1.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104`
*   `haystack` and `needle` consist of only lowercase English characters.
Attacked Question: Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** haystack =  "sadbutsad ", needle =  "sad "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:**  "sad " occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** haystack =  "leetcode ", needle =  "leeto "
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**  "leeto " did not occur in  "leetcode ", so we return -1.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104`
*   `haystack` and `needle` consist of only lowercase English characters.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the first occurrence of the string `needle` within the string `haystack`. If `needle` is found, we return the starting index of its first occurrence; otherwise, we return -1.

### Approach

1. **Check for Empty Needle:** If `needle` is empty, return 0 immediately, as an empty string is considered to start at index 0.
2. **Iterate Through Haystack:** We'll iterate through `haystack` with a loop that goes up to `len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1` to ensure we don't go out of bounds.
3. **Check for Match:** For each position in `haystack`, check if the substring of length `len(needle)` starting from the current position matches `needle`.
4. **Return Index:** If a match is found, return the current index. If no match is found after checking all possible positions, return -1.

Original Question: Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide two integers **without** using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, `8.345` would be truncated to `8`, and `-2.7335` would be truncated to `-2`.

Return _the **quotient** after dividing_ `dividend` _by_ `divisor`.

**Note:** Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the **32-bit** signed integer range: `[-231, 231 - 1]`. For this problem, if the quotient is **strictly greater than** `231 - 1`, then return `231 - 1`, and if the quotient is **strictly less than** `-231`, then return `-231`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** dividend = 10, divisor = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 10/3 = 3.33333.. which is truncated to 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** dividend = 7, divisor = -3
**Output:** -2
**Explanation:** 7/-3 = -2.33333.. which is truncated to -2.

**Constraints:**

*   `-231 <= dividend, divisor <= 231 - 1`
*   `divisor != 0`

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to implement integer division without using multiplication, division, and mod operators. We have to handle edge cases, especially with the minimum and maximum values of a 32-bit signed integer.

### Approach

1. **Handle Edge Cases:**
   - If the dividend is `INT_MIN` and the divisor is `-1`, the result would be `INT_MAX + 1`, which overflows. So, we need to handle this case separately.
   - Determine the sign of the result based on the signs of the dividend and divisor.

2. **Use Bit Manipulation:**
   - Convert both dividend and divisor to their absolute values.
   - Use bit shifting to find the largest multiple of the divisor that can be subtracted from the dividend in each step.

3. **Build the Quotient:**
   - Use bit manipulation to build the quotient by shifting and adding based on the subtraction steps.

4. **Apply the Sign:**
   - Adjust the final result based on the determined sign.

Original Question: You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of `words` are of **the same length**.

A **concatenated substring** in `s` is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of `words` concatenated.

*   For example, if `words = [ "ab ", "cd ", "ef "]`, then `"abcdef "`, `"abefcd "`, `"cdabef "`, `"cdefab "`, `"efabcd "`, and `"efcdab "` are all concatenated strings. `"acdbef "` is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of `words`.

Return _the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in_ `s`. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "barfoothefoobarman ", words = \[ "foo ", "bar "\]
**Output:** \[0,9\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 2 and words\[i\].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.
The substring starting at 0 is  "barfoo ". It is the concatenation of \[ "bar ", "foo "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is  "foobar ". It is the concatenation of \[ "foo ", "bar "\] which is a permutation of words.
The output order does not matter. Returning \[9,0\] is fine too.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword ", words = \[ "word ", "good ", "best ", "word "\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 4 and words\[i\].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.
There is no substring of length 16 is s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.
We return an empty array.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "barfoofoobarthefoobarman ", words = \[ "bar ", "foo ", "the "\]
**Output:** \[6,9,12\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 3 and words\[i\].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 9.
The substring starting at 6 is  "foobarthe ". It is the concatenation of \[ "foo ", "bar ", "the "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is  "barthefoo ". It is the concatenation of \[ "bar ", "the ", "foo "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 12 is  "thefoobar ". It is the concatenation of \[ "the ", "foo ", "bar "\] which is a permutation of words.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 104`
*   `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
*   `s` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find all starting indices in the string `s` where a substring exists that is a concatenation of all the strings in `words`, in any order, without any intervals. Each string in `words` has the same length.

### Approach

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `s` is empty or `words` is empty, return an empty list.
   - Calculate the length of each word in `words` (assuming all are of the same length) and the total length of the concatenated substring we are looking for.

2. **Frequency Map**:
   - Create a frequency map for the words array to keep track of how many times each word appears.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - Use a sliding window of size equal to the total length of the concatenated words.
   - For each window, check if the substring can be formed by the words in `words` by maintaining a frequency map of the words in the current window.
   - If the frequency map of the current window matches the frequency map of `words`, record the starting index of the window.

4. **Optimization**:
   - To handle cases where the string length is large, optimize the sliding window approach to avoid redundant computations.

Original Question: A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

*   For example, for `arr = [1,2,3]`, the following are all the permutations of `arr`: `[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]`.

The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

*   For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.
*   Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.
*   While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers `nums`, _find the next permutation of_ `nums`.

The replacement must be **[in place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** and use only constant extra memory.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** \[1,3,2\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,1\]
**Output:** \[1,2,3\]

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,5\]

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to implement the "next permutation" algorithm, which finds the lexicographically next greater permutation of a given array of numbers. If such a permutation does not exist (i.e., the array is in descending order), the algorithm should rearrange the array into the smallest possible order, which is ascending order.

### Approach

1. **Find the Pivot**: Starting from the end of the array, find the first element that is smaller than the element immediately after it. This element is called the pivot.
2. **Find the Successor**: Find the smallest element to the right of the pivot that is larger than the pivot.
3. **Swap the Pivot and Successor**: Swap these two elements.
4. **Reverse the_suffix**: Reverse the subarray to the right of the original pivot position to get the smallest lexicographical order for that part.

If no pivot is found, it means the entire array is in descending order, and we simply reverse the entire array to make it ascending.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest valid parentheses substring in a given string consisting of only '(' and ')' characters. We will use a stack-based approach to efficiently solve this problem.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize a stack to keep track of the indices of parentheses.
   - We push -1 onto the stack to handle the case when the entire string is valid parentheses.

2. **Iterate through the string**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - If it is '(', we push its index onto the stack.
     - If it is ')':
       - We check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is '('. If so, we pop the stack (matching pair found).
       - If not, we push the index of this ')' onto the stack.

3. **Calculate the length of valid substrings**:
   - After processing all characters, the stack will contain indices of unmatched parentheses.
   - We calculate the length between these indices to find the lengths of valid parentheses substrings.
   - The maximum length among these is our answer.

## Solution Code
Response: python
def longestValidParentheses(s):
    stack = []
    stack.append(-1)  # Initialize stack with -1
    max_length = 0

                max_length = max(max_length, i - stack[-1])
            else:

Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return _the index of_ `target` _if it is in_ `nums`_, or_ `-1` _if it is not in_ `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,6,7,0,1,2\], target = 0
**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,6,7,0,1,2\], target = 3
**Output:** -1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1\], target = 0
**Output:** -1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
*   All values of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
*   `-104 <= target <= 104`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the index of a target value in a rotated sorted array with distinct values, and we must do it efficiently, specifically in O(log n) time complexity. This suggests that we should use a binary search approach, which is typically O(log n), but we need to adapt it to handle the rotation.

### Approach

1. **Identify the Rotation Point**: The array is sorted but rotated. If we can find the index where the rotation occurs (the pivot), we can adjust our binary search accordingly.
2. **Modified Binary Search**: Instead of performing a standard binary search, we need to consider which part of the array is sorted and how the target relates to those parts.

Original Question: Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value.

If `target` is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[5,7,7,8,8,10\], target = 8
**Output:** \[3,4\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[5,7,7,8,8,10\], target = 6
**Output:** \[-1,-1\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[\], target = 0
**Output:** \[-1,-1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `nums` is a non-decreasing array.
*   `-109 <= target <= 109`

*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the starting and ending positions of a given target value in a sorted array of integers. The algorithm should have a runtime complexity of O(log n), which suggests using binary search.

### Approach

1. **Binary Search for Left Boundary:**
   - We perform a binary search to find the leftmost occurrence of the target.
   - If the middle element is equal to the target, we record its position and continue searching to the left.
   - If the middle element is less than the target, we search in the right half.
   - If the middle element is greater than the target, we search in the left half.

2. **Binary Search for Right Boundary:**
   - Similarly, we perform another binary search to find the rightmost occurrence of the target.
   - If the middle element is equal to the target, we record its position and continue searching to the right.
   - If the middle element is less than the target, we search in the right half.
   - If the middle element is greater than the target, we search in the left half.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the target is not found in the array, both boundary searches will return -1.
   - If the array is empty, immediately return [-1, -1].

### Solution Code
Response: python
def searchRange(nums, target):
    left = find_left(nums, target)

        if nums[mid] == target:
            boundary = mid

Original Question: Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1.  Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2.  Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3.  Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given 9x9 Sudoku board is valid based on the rules provided. Specifically, we need to check that:

1. Each row contains the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column contains the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes contains the digits 1-9 without repetition.

We are only concerned with the filled cells (cells containing digits from 1 to 9), and we can ignore the empty cells denoted by '.'.

### Approach

1. **Check Rows:** For each row, collect the digits and ensure there are no duplicates.
2. **Check Columns:** For each column, collect the digits and ensure there are no duplicates.
3. **Check Sub-Boxes:** For each of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes, collect the digits and ensure there are no duplicates.

To implement this efficiently, we can use sets to track the occurrences of digits in rows, columns, and sub-boxes.

CoT: To solve a Sudoku puzzle using Python, we can use a backtracking algorithm. Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions and abandons a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be extended to a valid solution.

### Approach

1. **Identify Empty Cells:** Start by finding an empty cell (represented by '.'). If all cells are filled, the puzzle is solved.
2. **Try Possible Numbers:** For each empty cell, try numbers from 1 to 9.
3. **Check Validity:** For each number, check if it is safe to place in the current position. This involves checking the row, column, and the 3x3 subgrid to ensure the number doesn't already exist there.
4. **Backtrack:** If a number is valid, place it in the cell and recursively try to fill the next empty cell. If this leads to a solution, return true. If not, backtrack and try the next number.
5. **Mark Invalid Paths:** If no number can be placed in a cell, mark the path as invalid and return false to trigger backtracking.

Original Question: The **count-and-say** sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

*   `countAndSay(1) = "1 "`
*   `countAndSay(n)` is the way you would "say " the digit string from `countAndSay(n-1)`, which is then converted into a different digit string.

To determine how you "say " a digit string, split it into the **minimal** number of substrings such that each substring contains exactly **one** unique digit. Then for each substring, say the number of digits, then say the digit. Finally, concatenate every said digit.

For example, the saying and conversion for digit string `"3322251 "`:

Given a positive integer `n`, return _the_ `nth` _term of the **count-and-say** sequence_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:**  "1 "
**Explanation:** This is the base case.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 4
**Output:**  "1211 "
**Explanation:**
countAndSay(1) =  "1 "
countAndSay(2) = say  "1 " = one 1 =  "11 "
countAndSay(3) = say  "11 " = two 1's =  "21 "
countAndSay(4) = say  "21 " = one 2 + one 1 =  "12 " +  "11 " =  "1211 "

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 30`

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence. The sequence is defined recursively, starting from the first term which is "1". Each subsequent term is generated by "saying" the previous term and converting that description into digits.

### Approach

1. **Base Case:** If `n` is 1, the sequence is "1".
2. **Recursive Generation:** For `n > 1`, we need to generate the sequence step by step from the first term up to the nth term.
3. **Say Function:** We need a helper function to "say" the current sequence, which involves counting consecutive digits and forming a new sequence based on these counts and digits.

Original Question: Given an array of **distinct** integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return _a list of all **unique combinations** of_ `candidates` _where the chosen numbers sum to_ `target`_._ You may return the combinations in **any order**.

The **same** number may be chosen from `candidates` an **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** candidates = \[2,3,6,7\], target = 7
**Output:** \[\[2,2,3\],\[7\]\]
**Explanation:**
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.

**Example 2:**

**Constraints:**

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach. The idea is to explore all possible combinations of candidates that sum up to the target. Since we can use the same candidate multiple times, we need to allow revisiting the same candidate in our recursive calls.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Sort the Candidates:** Sorting the array can help in pruning some branches early if the current candidate exceeds the remaining target.

2. **Backtracking Function:** We'll define a recursive function that takes the current combination, the current index in candidates, and the remaining target.

3. **Base Cases:**
   - If the remaining target is zero, we've found a valid combination.
   - If the remaining target is negative or we've considered all candidates, this path doesn't lead to a solution.

4. **Recursive Case:**
   - For each candidate starting from the current index, we add it to the current combination and recurse with the updated target.
   - After the recursive call, we backtrack by removing the last added candidate.

Let's implement this plan in Python.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find all unique combinations of numbers from the given `candidates` array that sum up to the `target`. We can use each number in `candidates` an unlimited number of times. The key points are:

- The numbers in `candidates` are distinct.
- We need to return a list of combinations, where each combination sums up to the target.
- The same number can be used multiple times in a combination.
- The frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers must be different for two combinations to be unique.

### Approach

1. **Sorting the Candidates:**
   - Sorting the array helps in pruning some branches early if the current candidate exceeds the remaining target.

2. **Backtracking Approach:**
   - Use a recursive backtracking function to explore all possible combinations.
   - The function will keep track of the current combination, the current index in the candidates array, and the remaining target.
   - **Base Cases:**
     - If the remaining target is zero, add the current combination to the result list.
     - If the remaining target is negative or all candidates have been considered, terminate the recursion.
   - **Recursive Case:**
     - For each candidate starting from the current index, add it to the current combination and recurse with the updated target.
     - Backtrack by removing the last added candidate after the recursive call.

*   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest missing positive integer from an unsorted array of integers. The challenge is to do this in O(n) time complexity and using constant extra space.

### Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array.
   - The array can contain any integers, including negatives and zeros.

2. **Insights:**
   - The smallest positive integer is 1.
   - If 1 is missing, then 1 is the answer.
   - If 1 is present, we need to check for 2, and so on.

3. **Optimal Solution:**
   - We can use the array indices to mark the presence of numbers.
   - Since we are dealing with positive integers, and the array is of size n, the smallest missing positive integer must be between 1 and n+1.
   - Place each number in its correct position, i.e., number x should be at index x-1.
   - After rearranging, iterate through the array to find the first position where the number is not equal to its index + 1.

4. **Steps:**
   - Ignore numbers that are less than or equal to 0 or greater than n, as they are not in the range of possible smallest missing positive integers.
   - Swap numbers to their correct positions.
   - Finally, iterate through the array to find the first number that does not match its index + 1.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == height.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
*   `0 <= height[i] <= 105`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much water can be trapped between the bars represented by their heights. This is a classic problem that can be efficiently solved using the two-pointer approach.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We'll use two pointers, one starting from the left end and the other from the right end of the array.
   - We'll also keep track of the maximum height seen so far from both the left and the right.
   - We'll initialize a variable to store the total amount of trapped water.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - While the left pointer is less than the right pointer:
     - If the height at the left pointer is less than the height at the right pointer:
       - If the current height at the left pointer is greater than the left maximum, update the left maximum.
       - Otherwise, add the difference between the left maximum and the current height to the total trapped water.
       - Move the left pointer to the right.
     - Else:
       - If the current height at the right pointer is greater than the right maximum, update the right maximum.
       - Otherwise, add the difference between the right maximum and the current height to the total trapped water.
       - Move the right pointer to the left.

3. **Return the Total Trapped Water**.

This approach ensures that we only traverse the array once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n).

### Solution Code

def trap(height):
    if not height:
        return 0

    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to multiply two numbers represented as strings without converting them directly into integers or using any big integer libraries. We will achieve this by simulating the multiplication process digit by digit, similar to how we do it manually.

### Approach

1. **Initialization:**
   - Determine the lengths of the input strings `num1` and `num2`.
   - Create a result array of zeros with a length equal to the sum of the lengths of `num1` and `num2`. This will store the intermediate results of the multiplication.

2. **Multiplication:**
   - Iterate through each digit of `num1` and `num2` from right to left.
   - For each pair of digits, multiply them and add the result to the appropriate position in the result array.
   - Handle carrying over to the next position if the product is greater than 9.

3. **Conversion to String:**
   - Convert the result array back into a string, removing any leading zeros.

Original Question: Given an input string (`s`) and a pattern (`p`), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for `'?'` and `'*'` where:

*   `'?'` Matches any single character.
*   `'*'` Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "aa ", p =  "a "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:**  "a " does not match the entire string  "aa ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "aa ", p =  "\* "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** '\*' matches any sequence.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "cb ", p =  "?a "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** '?' matches 'c', but the second letter is 'a', which does not match 'b'.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length, p.length <= 2000`
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
*   `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'?'` or `'*'`.

*   `0 <= s.length, p.length <= 2000`
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
*   `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'?'` or `'*'`.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to implement a wildcard pattern matching algorithm that supports the special characters `'?'` and `'*'`. The goal is to determine if the entire input string `s` matches the pattern `p`.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Wildcards:**
   - `'?'` matches any single character.
   - `'*'` matches any sequence of characters, including the empty sequence.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Table:**
   - We will use a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the first `i` characters of `s` match the first `j` characters of `p`.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `dp[0][0]` is `True` because an empty pattern matches an empty string.
   - For patterns starting with `'*'`, `dp[0][j]` can be `True` if the previous pattern character is `'*'`.

4. **Filling the DP Table:**
   - If the current pattern character is a lowercase letter or `'?'`, check if it matches the corresponding character in `s`.
   - If the current pattern character is `'*'`, it can match zero or more characters in `s`.

5. **Result:**
   - The value at `dp[len(s)][len(p)]` will tell us if the entire string `s` matches the pattern `p`.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def isMatch(s: str, p: str) -> bool:
    m, n = len(s), len(p)
    
    # Initialize DP table

    # Empty pattern matches empty string
    dp[0][0] = True
    
    # Handle patterns with '*' at the beginning
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if p[j - 1] == '*':

Original Question: You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at `nums[0]`.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index `i`. In other words, if you are at `nums[i]`, you can jump to any `nums[i + j]` where:

*   `0 <= j <= nums[i]` and
*   `i + j < n`

Return _the minimum number of jumps to reach_ `nums[n - 1]`. The test cases are generated such that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,1,1,4\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,0,1,4\]
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
*   It's guaranteed that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.

*   It's guaranteed that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index of the array `nums`, starting from the first index. Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum distance we can jump forward from that position.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize three variables:
     - `jumps` to count the number of jumps made.
     - `current_end` to keep track of the farthest position we can reach with the current number of jumps.
     - `farthest` to keep track of the farthest position we can reach with one more jump.

2. **Iteration**:
   - We iterate through the array from the start to the second last element.
   - For each position `i`, we calculate the farthest position we can reach from `i`, which is `i + nums[i]`, and update `farthest` if this value is greater than the current `farthest`.
   - When we reach the end of the current jump range (`i` equals `current_end`), we make a jump, increment the `jumps` count, and set `current_end` to the `farthest` position we could reach.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop continues until we reach the last index or beyond.
   - The number of jumps made will be the minimum number required to reach the last index.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def jump(nums):
    jumps = 0
    current_end = 0
    farthest = 0
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        farthest = max(farthest, i + nums[i])
        if i == current_end:
            jumps += 1
            current_end = farthest

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 6`
*   `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
*   All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to generate all possible permutations of a given array of distinct integers. A permutation is a rearrangement of the elements of the array. For example, for the input array [1, 2, 3], the permutations are:

1. [1, 2, 3]
2. [1, 3, 2]
3. [2, 1, 3]
4. [2, 3, 1]
5. [3, 1, 2]
6. [3, 2, 1]

We need to return all these permutations in any order.

### Approach

We can use a backtracking approach to generate all permutations. Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to a problem that involves searching through a large number of potential candidates.

Here’s how the backtracking approach works for generating permutations:

1. **Choose an Element:** Start by choosing an element from the array to be the first element of the permutation.
2. **Recurse with Remaining Elements:** Recursively generate permutations of the remaining elements.
3. **Backtrack:** Once all permutations starting with the chosen element are generated, backtrack and choose the next element.

We can implement this using a recursive function that maintains a current permutation and a list of used indices to avoid duplicates.

### Solution Code

def permute(nums):
    def backtrack(start):
        if start == len(nums):

        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]
            backtrack(start + 1)
            nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]  # backtrack

    result = []
    backtrack(0)

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to generate all unique permutations of a given list of numbers, `nums`, which may contain duplicates. The key here is to ensure that the permutations are unique, even when there are duplicate numbers in the input list.

### Approach

1. **Sorting for Grouping Duplicates:** We start by sorting the `nums` list. This step is crucial because it groups identical numbers together, making it easier to handle duplicates.

2. **Backtracking for Permutations:** We use a backtracking approach to generate permutations. This involves recursively building permutations by choosing one number at a time and backtracking when all positions are filled.

3. **Skipping Duplicates:** To avoid generating duplicate permutations, we skip over identical numbers that have already been considered at the current position in the permutation.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise in place, meaning we should not use extra space for another matrix. The key to achieving this is to realize that rotating the matrix can be broken down into two simple steps:

1. **Transpose the matrix:** This means swapping elements across the diagonal, turning rows into columns and vice versa.
2. **Reverse each row:** After transposing, reversing each row will give us the desired 90-degree clockwise rotation.

### Approach

1. **Transpose the Matrix:**
   - For each element in the upper triangle of the matrix (excluding the diagonal), swap it with its corresponding element in the lower triangle.
   - This step effectively mirrors the matrix over its main diagonal.

2. **Reverse Each Row:**
   - After transposing, reverse the order of elements in each row to complete the 90-degree rotation.

*   `-104 <= xn <= 104`
CoT: I've got this problem to implement the power function, which calculates x raised to the power of n, or x^n. I need to do this in Python. Let's see how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking for. Given a number x and an integer n, I need to compute x to the power of n. Simple enough. But I need to make sure I handle all the cases, especially since n can be negative.

Looking at the constraints:

- x is between -100 and 100, excluding -100 and 100.

- n is an integer between -2^31 and 2^31 - 1, which is a pretty wide range.

- The result should be between -10^4 and 10^4.

I need to handle both positive and negative exponents. For positive exponents, it's straightforward. For negative exponents, I need to compute 1 over x to the power of the absolute value of n.

I should also consider the edge cases:

1. When n is 0, anything to the power of 0 is 1.

2. When x is 0, 0 to any positive power is 0, but 0 to a negative power is undefined (division by zero).

3. When x is negative, and n is positive, it's fine. But if n is negative, I need to handle the reciprocal, which would be a fraction with a negative number in the denominator.

4. Also, need to handle large exponents without causing overflow or making the function too slow.

Efficiency is important, especially since n can be up to 2^31 - 1, which is over 2 billion. If I use a simple loop to multiply x by itself n times, that would be too slow for large n. So, I need a more efficient way to compute large exponents.

I recall that there's a method called "exponentiation by squaring" which is a faster way to compute large powers. It reduces the number of multiplications needed by using the property that x^n = (x^(n/2))^2 if n is even, and x^n = x * (x^((n-1)/2))^2 if n is odd. This approach has a time complexity of O(log n), which is much better than the naive O(n) approach.

Let me think about how to implement this.

First, handle the base cases:

- If n is 0, return 1.

- If x is 0, need to handle separately based on n being positive or negative.

Then, for positive n, use the exponentiation by squaring method.

For negative n, compute the positive power and take the reciprocal.

Also, need to handle negative x values properly, especially when n is negative.

Let me sketch a rough plan:

1. If n is 0, return 1.

2. If x is 0:

- If n is positive, return 0.

- If n is negative, it's undefined (division by zero), so maybe return a special value or raise an error.

3. If n is positive:

- Use exponentiation by squaring to compute x^n.

4. If n is negative:

- Compute x^|n| using exponentiation by squaring.

- Then take the reciprocal: 1 / (x^|n|).

Now, implement the exponentiation by squaring function.

I can write a helper function, say `pow_helper(x, n)`, which assumes n is non-negative.

Here's a rough idea of how `pow_helper` can work:

- Initialize result to 1.

- While n is greater than 0:

- If n is odd, multiply result by x.

- n = n // 2

- x = x * x

- Return result.

This is the iterative version of exponentiation by squaring.

Let me test this logic with an example.

Say x = 2, n = 10.

Initialize result = 1.

Loop:

n = 10 (even), x = 4, n = 5.

n = 5 (odd), result = 1 * 4 = 4, n = 2, x = 16.

n = 2 (even), x = 256, n = 1.

n = 1 (odd), result = 4 * 256 = 1024, n = 0.

Return 1024.

Correct.

Another example: x = 3, n = 4.

result = 1.

n = 4 (even), x = 9, n = 2.

n = 2 (even), x = 81, n = 1.

n = 1 (odd), result = 1 * 81 = 81, n = 0.

Return 81.

Correct.

Now, for negative n, say x = 2, n = -3.

Compute x^3 = 8.

Then, 1 / 8 = 0.125.

Correct.

Edge cases:

- x = 0, n = 0: undefined? But usually, 0^0 is defined as 1 in programming contexts.

- x = 0, n = positive: 0.

- x = 0, n = negative: undefined, since it's 1 / 0^|n|, which is division by zero.

So, I need to handle x = 0 and n negative by raising an error or returning infinity or something.

In Python, 1 / 0 raises a ZeroDivisionError.

I should decide how to handle x = 0 and n negative.

Perhaps, I can return infinity or NaN, but according to the constraints, the result should be between -10^4 and 10^4, so maybe it's assumed that x won't be 0 when n is negative.

I need to check the constraints again.

Constraints:

- -100.0 < x < 100.0

- -2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1

- n is an integer.

- -10^4 <= x^n <= 10^4

Wait, but x^n can be between -10^4 and 10^4, but what if x is 0 and n is negative? 0^-1 is 1/0, which is infinity, which is outside of -10^4 to 10^4.

Maybe in this problem, it's assumed that x won't be 0 when n is negative.

I need to check the problem statement again.

It says: "-100.0 < x < 100.0", so x cannot be -100 or 100, but can be 0.

And n can be negative.

So, perhaps I need to handle the case when x is 0 and n is negative by raising an error or returning NaN.

But to keep it simple, maybe I can assume that x won't be 0 when n is negative, as per the constraints.

Alternatively, in the constraints for the result: "-10^4 <= x^n <= 10^4", which wouldn't include infinity.

So, probably, I should assume that x won't be 0 when n is negative.

I can add a check for that.

Now, another consideration is floating point precision.

Since x can be a float, and n can be large, I need to make sure that the result is accurate within the precision of floating points.

Python's float should handle this adequately for the given constraints.

Also, need to make sure that the function doesn't take too much time for large n.

But since I'm using the exponentiation by squaring method, which is O(log n), it should be fast enough even for n up to 2^31 - 1.

Now, let's think about the implementation step by step.

First, define the function, say `my_pow(x, n)`.

Check if n is 0:

return 1.0

Check if x is 0:

if n > 0:

return 0.0

else:

raise ValueError("Cannot raise zero to a negative power")

If n > 0:

return pow_helper(x, n)

else:

return 1 / pow_helper(x, -n)

Now, implement pow_helper(x, n), assuming n >= 0.

Initialize result = 1.0

While n > 0:

if n is odd:

result *= x

n //= 2

x *= x

Return result

I need to make sure that all variables are floats to handle decimal places.

Also, need to handle negative x values.

Wait, if x is negative and n is fractional, it would be a complex number, but since n is an integer, it's fine.

Wait, n is an integer, so even if n is negative, x^n is 1 / (x^|n|), which is fine for negative x.

But in the constraints, x is between -100 and 100, excluding -100 and 100, and n is an integer.

So, no issue with complex numbers.

I need to make sure that the function works for negative x and positive n.

For example, x = -2, n = 3: (-2)^3 = -8.

x = -2, n = 2: (-2)^2 = 4.

x = -2, n = -2: 1 / (-2)^2 = 1 / 4 = 0.25.

So, the sign is important when x is negative and n is positive.

When n is negative, it's the reciprocal, but since n is integer, it's fine.

I think the helper function will handle this correctly.

Let me test it with x = -2, n = 3.

pow_helper(-2, 3):

result = 1

n = 3 (odd), result = 1 * (-2) = -2, n = 1, x = 4

n = 1 (odd), result = -2 * 4 = -8, n = 0

Return -8

Correct.

Another test: x = -2, n = 2.

result = 1

n = 2 (even), x = 4, n = 1

n = 1 (odd), result = 1 * 4 = 4, n = 0

Return 4

Correct.

For x = -2, n = -2:

Compute pow_helper(-2, 2) = 4

Then, 1 / 4 = 0.25

Correct.

Looks good.

Now, implement this in code.

Also, need to consider the time and space complexity.

The iterative approach uses O(1) space and O(log n) time, which is efficient.

I should also consider the edge cases in terms of floating point precision.

For example, very small exponents may result in very small numbers close to zero.

Python's float should handle this adequately.

Another consideration is when n is INT_MIN, which is -2^31.

In Python, integers can be arbitrary size, so no issue.

But need to make sure that -n doesn't cause overflow.

In Python, it's not an issue.

Now, let's think about writing the code.

Define the function my_pow(x, n):

if n == 0:

return 1.0

if x == 0:

if n > 0:

return 0.0

else:

raise ValueError("Cannot raise zero to a negative power")

if n > 0:

return pow_helper(x, n)

else:

return 1 / pow_helper(x, -n)

Define pow_helper(x, n):

result = 1.0

while n > 0:

if n % 2 == 1:

result *= x

n //= 2

x *= x

return result

I need to make sure that all operations are using floating points.

Also, need to handle negative n correctly.

Let me test this logic with the sample inputs.

Example 1:

x = 2.00000, n = 10

pow_helper(2, 10) = 1024.0

Return 1024.0

Correct.

Example 2:

x = 2.10000, n = 3

pow_helper(2.1, 3) = 2.1 * (2.1^2) = 2.1 * 4.41 = 9.261

Correct.

Example 3:

x = 2.00000, n = -2

pow_helper(2, 2) = 4

1 / 4 = 0.25

Correct.

Another test:

x = -2, n = 3

pow_helper(-2, 3) = -8

Correct.

x = -2, n = 2

pow_helper(-2, 2) = 4

Correct.

x = -2, n = -2

pow_helper(-2, 2) = 4

1 / 4 = 0.25

Correct.

Looks good.

Now, implement this in code.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to implement a function that calculates \( x^n \) efficiently, handling both positive and negative exponents, and considering edge cases such as zero and negative bases.

### Approach
1. **Base Cases**:
   - If \( n \) is 0, return 1 since any number to the power of 0 is 1.
   - If \( x \) is 0, handle it based on the value of \( n \):
     - If \( n \) is positive, return 0.
     - If \( n \) is negative, raising zero to a negative power is undefined (division by zero), so we need to handle this case appropriately.

2. **Positive Exponent**:
   - Use the "exponentiation by squaring" method for efficiency. This method reduces the number of multiplications needed and works in \( O(\log n) \) time complexity.

3. **Negative Exponent**:
   - Compute the positive power and then take the reciprocal.

4. **Helper Function**:
   - Implement a helper function `pow_helper(x, n)` that computes \( x^n \) for non-negative \( n \) using an iterative approach to exponentiation by squaring.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def my_pow(x, n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1.0
    if x == 0:
        if n > 0:
            return 0.0
        else:
            raise ValueError("Cannot raise zero to a negative power")
    
    if n > 0:
        return pow_helper(x, n)
    else:
        return 1 / pow_helper(x, -n)

def pow_helper(x, n):
    result = 1.0
    while n > 0:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            result *= x
        n //= 2
        x *= x
    return result

# Example usage:
print(my_pow(2.00000, 10))  # Output: 1024.00000
print(my_pow(2.10000, 3))   # Output: 9.26100
print(my_pow(2.00000, -2))  # Output: 0.25000

CoT: To solve the N-Queens problem, we need to place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

### Approach

1. **Backtracking**: We will use a backtracking approach to place queens one by one in different columns, starting from the leftmost column. For each column, we try placing a queen in each row of that column, checking if this placement leads to a solution. If placing a queen in a particular position leads to a conflict, we backtrack and try another position.

2. **Conflict Checking**: For each position where we place a queen, we need to check if it is safe from attacks by previously placed queens. This involves checking the row, column, and both diagonals.

3. **Solution Representation**: We will represent the chessboard as a list of strings, where each string represents a row on the board. Each character in the string is either 'Q' (queen) or '.' (empty space).

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum. This is a classic problem in computer science known as the "Maximum Subarray Problem." There are several approaches to solve this problem, but I'll focus on two efficient methods: Kadane's Algorithm and the Divide and Conquer approach.

### Approach 1: Kadane's Algorithm

Kadane's Algorithm is a dynamic programming approach that solves the problem in linear time, O(n). The idea is to iterate through the array, keeping track of the current subarray sum. If the current subarray sum becomes negative, we reset it to zero because a negative sum would only decrease the sum of any future subarrays. We also keep track of the maximum sum found so far.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to traverse a 2D matrix in a spiral order and collect all its elements in that sequence. The matrix has dimensions `m x n`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Determine the total number of elements in the matrix, which is `m * n`.
   - Initialize four variables to keep track of the boundaries of the spiral: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.

2. **Traversal**:
   - Traverse the top row from left to right.
   - Traverse the right column from top to bottom.
   - Traverse the bottom row from right to left.
   - Traverse the left column from bottom to top.
   - Adjust the boundary variables after each full traversal of a row or column.
   - Repeat the process until all elements are traversed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle matrices with a single row or a single column.
   - Ensure that no element is visited more than once.

Original Question: You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` _if you can reach the last index, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,1,1,4\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,1,0,4\]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can reach the last index of an array given that each element in the array represents the maximum jump length from that position. We can approach this problem using a greedy algorithm, where we keep track of the farthest position we can reach as we iterate through the array.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**: Start with the first element of the array. Initialize a variable `max_reach` to keep track of the maximum index we can reach.
2. **Iteration**: Iterate through the array from the first index to the last. For each index `i`, check if it is within the current `max_reach`. If it is, update `max_reach` to be the maximum of its current value and `i + nums[i]`. If `max_reach` is greater than or equal to the last index, return `True`.
3. **Check for impossibility**: If we encounter an index that is beyond the current `max_reach`, return `False` because it's impossible to reach further.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check the reachability without unnecessary computations, making it optimal for large arrays.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def canJump(nums):
    max_reach = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if i > max_reach:

Original Question: Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return _an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input_.

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = \[\[1,4\],\[4,5\]\]
**Output:** \[\[1,5\]\]
**Explanation:** Intervals \[1,4\] and \[4,5\] are considered overlapping.

*   `intervals[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= starti <= endi <= 104`

*   `1 <= intervals.length <= 104`
*   `intervals[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= starti <= endi <= 104`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to merge overlapping intervals in a given list of intervals. Each interval is represented as a pair of start and end times. The goal is to return a new list of intervals where overlapping intervals are combined into a single interval.

### Approach

1. **Sort the Intervals**: First, we sort the intervals based on their start times. This helps us to efficiently merge overlapping intervals by traversing the sorted list sequentially.

2. **Initialize a Result List**: We create an empty list to store the merged intervals.

3. **Merge Intervals**:
   - We iterate through the sorted intervals.
   - For each interval, we check if it overlaps with the last interval in the result list.
   - If it overlaps, we merge them by updating the end time of the last interval in the result list to the maximum of the current end time and the end time of the last interval in the result list.
   - If it does not overlap, we add the current interval to the result list.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the list of merged intervals.

    if not intervals:

Original Question: You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the `ith` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` _after the insertion_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = \[\[1,3\],\[6,9\]\], newInterval = \[2,5\]
**Output:** \[\[1,5\],\[6,9\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = \[\[1,2\],\[3,5\],\[6,7\],\[8,10\],\[12,16\]\], newInterval = \[4,8\]

   - We'll use a list to collect the resulting intervals.

2. **Iteration and Merge Logic**:
   - Traverse the list of intervals:
     - If the current interval ends before the new interval starts, add the current interval to the result list.
     - If the new interval ends before the current interval starts, add the new interval to the result list and then add the remaining intervals.
     - If there is an overlap between the current interval and the new interval, merge them by updating the start and end of the new interval to cover both.

3. **Final Addition**:
   - After processing all intervals, add the new interval to the result list if it hasn't been added yet.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** \[\[1\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 20`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to generate an `n x n` matrix filled with numbers from 1 to `n²` in a spiral order. This means we fill the matrix starting from the top-left corner and move right, then down, then left, and then up, repeating this pattern until the entire matrix is filled.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create an `n x n` matrix initialized with zeros.
   - Define variables to keep track of the current position in the matrix: `row` and `col`.
   - Define variables to keep track of the boundaries of the spiral: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.

2. **Filling the Matrix in Spiral Order**:
   - Use a loop to fill the matrix in layers, starting from the outermost layer and moving inwards.
   - For each layer, fill the top row from left to right, the right column from top to bottom, the bottom row from right to left, and the left column from bottom to top.
   - Adjust the boundaries after filling each layer.
   - Increment a counter to fill the matrix with consecutive integers.

3. **Termination**:
   - Continue the process until all layers are filled.

2. **Steps to Find the k-th Permutation**:
   - Calculate factorial values up to n-1.
   - Create a list of candidates (numbers from 1 to n).
   - Adjust k to be zero-based.

CoT: To solve the problem of rotating a linked list to the right by `k` places, we need to perform a series of steps to manipulate the list's structure. The key idea is to make the list circular, find the new head after rotation, and then break the circularity.

### Approach

1. **Handle Edge Cases:** If the list is empty or has only one node, or if `k` is zero, return the list as is.
2. **Calculate Length:** Determine the length of the list and make it circular by connecting the last node to the head.
3. **Find New Head:** Calculate the position of the new head after rotating right by `k` places. Since rotating right by `k` places is equivalent to rotating left by `length - k % length` places, we can find the new head accordingly.
4. **Break Circularity:** Set the new tail's next pointer to `None` to break the circular structure and return the new head.

Attacked Question: There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 7
**Output:** 28

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 2
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= m, n <= 100`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to build up a solution by calculating the number of unique paths to each cell in the grid, starting from the top-left corner and moving towards the bottom-right corner.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a 2D array `dp` of size `m x n`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of unique paths to reach cell `(i, j)`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - The number of paths to reach any cell in the first row is 1 because the robot can only move right.
   - Similarly, the number of paths to reach any cell in the first column is 1 because the robot can only move down.

3. **Fill the DP Table**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)` (starting from `(1, 1)`), the number of unique paths is the sum of the paths from the cell above `(i-1, j)` and the cell to the left `(i, j-1)`.

4. **Result**:
   - The value in `dp[m-1][n-1]` will be the number of unique paths to reach the bottom-right corner.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def uniquePaths(m, n):
    # Initialize a 2D list with zeros
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Fill the first row with 1
    for i in range(m):
        dp[i][0] = 1
    
    # Fill the first column with 1
    for j in range(n):
        dp[0][j] = 1
    
    # Fill the dp table
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
    
    return dp[m-1][n-1]

Original Question: You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid`. There is a robot initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as `1` or `0` respectively in `grid`. A path that the robot takes cannot include **any** square that is an obstacle.

Return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** obstacleGrid = \[\[0,0,0\],\[0,1,0\],\[0,0,0\]\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right

**Example 2:**

**Input:** obstacleGrid = \[\[0,1\],\[0,0\]\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

### Approach

1. **Initialization:**
   - If the starting cell `(0, 0)` is an obstacle, there are no paths to reach the destination.
   - Initialize `dp[0][0]` to 1 if the starting cell is not an obstacle.

2. **Fill the DP Table:**
   - For the first row and first column, set `dp[i][0]` and `dp[0][j]` to 1 if there are no obstacles before cell `(i, 0)` or `(0, j)`, otherwise set to 0.
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, if it is not an obstacle, the number of unique paths to reach it is the sum of the unique paths to reach the cell above it (`dp[i-1][j]`) and the cell to the left of it (`dp[i][j-1]`).

3. **Return the Result:**
   - The value in `dp[m-1][n-1]` will be the number of unique paths to reach the bottom-right corner.

Original Question: Given a `m x n` `grid` filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,3,1\],\[1,5,1\],\[4,2,1\]\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** Because the path 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 minimizes the sum.

### Approach

1. **Initialize a DP Table:**
   - Create a 2D array `dp` of the same size as the grid to store the minimum path sum to each cell.
   
2. **Base Cases:**
   - The minimum path sum to the starting cell `(0, 0)` is simply `grid[0][0]`.
   - For cells in the first row, the path can only come from the left.
   - For cells in the first column, the path can only come from above.

3. **Fill the DP Table:**
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, the minimum path sum is the cell's value plus the minimum of the path sums from the cell above `(i-1, j)` and the cell to the left `(i, j-1)`.

Original Question: You are given a **large integer** represented as an integer array `digits`, where each `digits[i]` is the `ith` digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading `0`'s.

Increment the large integer by one and return _the resulting array of digits_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** digits = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** \[1,2,4\]
**Explanation:** The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be \[1,2,4\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** digits = \[4,3,2,1\]
**Output:** \[4,3,2,2\]
**Explanation:** The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be \[4,3,2,2\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** digits = \[9\]
**Output:** \[1,0\]
**Explanation:** The array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be \[1,0\].

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= digits.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= digits[i] <= 9`
*   `digits` does not contain any leading `0`'s.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to increment a large integer represented as an array of digits by one. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant, meaning the first element in the array is the highest place value.

### Approach

1. **Start from the least significant digit:** Since we're adding one to the number, we start from the last digit (least significant digit).
2. **Handle the addition and carry-over:** If the current digit is less than 9, we can simply add one to it and return the array. If it is 9, it becomes 0 and we carry over 1 to the next significant digit.
3. **Handle the case where all digits are 9:** If all digits are 9, adding one will turn all digits to 0 and we need to add an additional digit at the beginning with value 1.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def plusOne(digits):
    n = len(digits)
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        if digits[i] < 9:

            return digits
        digits[i] = 0
    # If all digits were 9
    return [1] + [0] * n

# Example usage:
print(plusOne([1,2,3]))  # Output: [1,2,4]
print(plusOne([4,3,2,1]))  # Output: [4,3,2,2]

**Constraints:**

*   `a` and `b` consist only of `'0'` or `'1'` characters.
*   Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
Attacked Question: Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return _their sum as a binary string_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** a = "11", b = "1"
**Output:** "100"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** a = "1010", b = "1011"

*   `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104`
*   `a` and `b` consist only of `'0'` or `'1'` characters.
*   Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to add two binary strings `a` and `b` and return their sum as a binary string. Binary addition follows the same rules as decimal addition, but with only two digits (0 and 1). The rules for binary addition are:

- 0 + 0 = 0
- 0 + 1 = 1
- 1 + 0 = 1
- 1 + 1 = 10 (which is 0 with a carry of 1)

Given that the input strings can be up to 10,000 characters long, we need an efficient way to handle the addition without converting the entire strings to integers, performing the addition, and then converting back to a string, as this could be inefficient for very large strings.

### Approach

1. **Initialize Pointers and Variables:**
   - Use pointers to traverse the strings from right to left.
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the carry.

2. **Iterate Through the Strings:**
   - Add the corresponding digits from each string along with the carry.
   - Compute the sum and the new carry.
   - Build the result string from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.

3. **Handle Remaining Digits and Carry:**
   - If one string is longer than the other, continue adding the remaining digits.
   - After processing both strings, if there is still a carry, add it to the result.

4. **Reverse the Result:**
   - Since we built the result from left to right (least significant bit to most significant bit), reverse it to get the correct binary string.

Original Question: Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

*   A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
*   Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than `0` and not exceed `maxWidth`.
*   The input array `words` contains at least one word.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = \[ "This ",  "is ",  "an ",  "example ",  "of ",  "text ",  "justification. "\], maxWidth = 16
**Output:**
\[
    "This    is    an ",

    "justification.   "
\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = \[ "What ", "must ", "be ", "acknowledgment ", "shall ", "be "\], maxWidth = 16
**Output:**
\[
   "What   must   be ",
   "acknowledgment   ",
   "shall be         "
\]
**Explanation:** Note that the last line is  "shall be     " instead of  "shall     be ", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = \[ "Science ", "is ", "what ", "we ", "understand ", "well ", "enough ", "to ", "explain ", "to ", "a ", "computer. ", "Art ", "is ", "everything ", "else ", "we ", "do "\], maxWidth = 20
**Output:**
\[

   "enough to explain to ",
   "a  computer.  Art is ",
   "everything  else  we ",

\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= words.length <= 300`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
*   `words[i]` consists of only English letters and symbols.
*   `1 <= maxWidth <= 100`

*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
*   `words[i]` consists of only English letters and symbols.
*   `1 <= maxWidth <= 100`
*   `words[i].length <= maxWidth`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to format a list of words into lines with a specified maximum width, applying specific justification rules. The key steps involve:

1. **Grouping words into lines:** Determine how many words can fit into each line without exceeding the maxWidth.
2. **Justifying the text:** For each line except the last one, distribute spaces evenly between words, giving extra spaces to the left slots if necessary. For the last line, left-justify the words with a single space between them and pad the remaining spaces on the right.

### Approach

1. **Line Formation:**
   - Use a greedy approach to pack as many words as possible into each line without exceeding the maxWidth.
   - Keep track of the current line's word count and the total length of words plus the minimum spaces needed.

2. **Text Justification:**
   - For each line except the last one:
     - Calculate the total number of spaces to distribute.
     - Determine the number of gaps between words and how to distribute the spaces evenly.
     - Assign extra spaces starting from the left.
   - For the last line:
     - Left-justify the words with a single space between them.
     - Pad the remaining spaces on the right to reach maxWidth.

3. **Edge Cases:**

Original Question: Given a non-negative integer `x`, return _the square root of_ `x` _rounded down to the nearest integer_. The returned integer should be **non-negative** as well.

You **must not use** any built-in exponent function or operator.

*   For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in c++ or `x ** 0.5` in python.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** x = 4
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = 8
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= x <= 231 - 1`
Attacked Question: Given a non-negative integer `x`, return _the square root of_ `x` _rounded down to the nearest integer_. The returned integer should be **non-negative** as well.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= x <= 231 - 1`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to compute the square root of a given non-negative integer `x` and return the largest integer less than or equal to the square root. We are not allowed to use any built-in exponent functions or operators, such as `pow(x, 0.5)` or `x ** 0.5`.

### Approach

1. **Binary Search:** We can use a binary search algorithm to efficiently find the integer square root of `x`. The square root of `x` lies between 0 and `x` itself.
2. **Initialization:** Start with the search range from 0 to `x`.
3. **Midpoint Calculation:** Calculate the midpoint of the current range and check if its square is equal to, less than, or greater than `x`.
4. **Adjust Search Range:** 
   - If the square of the midpoint is equal to `x`, we have found the exact square root.
   - If the square of the midpoint is less than `x`, the square root must be at least the midpoint, so adjust the lower bound.
   - If the square of the midpoint is greater than `x`, the square root must be less than the midpoint, so adjust the upper bound.
5. **Termination:** The process continues until the lower and upper bounds converge, ensuring we have the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `x`.

Original Question: You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 45`
Attacked Question: You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

**Explanation:** There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 45`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The key observation is that the number of ways to reach step `n` is equal to the sum of the ways to reach step `n-1` and step `n-2`, because from step `n-1` you can take one step to reach `n`, and from step `n-2` you can take two steps to reach `n`.

This is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones.

### Approach

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If `n` is 1, there is only one way to climb the staircase: take one step.
   - If `n` is 2, there are two ways: take two single steps or one double step.

2. **Dynamic Programming Array**:
   - We can use an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach the `i`-th step.
   - Initialize `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 2`.

3. **Filling the DP Array**:
   - For each step from 3 to `n`, calculate `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - The result will be `dp[n]`.

### Solution Code

Original Question: Given a string `path`, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.

In a Unix-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory, a double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `'//'`) are treated as a single slash `'/'`. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

The **canonical path** should have the following format:

*   The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.
*   Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.
*   The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.
*   The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

Return _the simplified **canonical path**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** path =  "/home/ "
**Output:**  "/home "
**Explanation:** Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** path =  "/../ "
**Output:**  "/ "
**Explanation:** Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** path =  "/home//foo/ "
**Output:**  "/home/foo "
**Explanation:** In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= path.length <= 3000`
*   `path` consists of English letters, digits, period `'.'`, slash `'/'` or `'_'`.
*   `path` is a valid absolute Unix path.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to simplify a given absolute path in a Unix-style file system to its canonical form. The canonical path should handle special cases like `.` (current directory), `..` (parent directory), and multiple slashes correctly.

### Approach

1. **Split the Path:** We'll split the input path by slashes `/` to get the individual components of the path.
2. **Use a Stack:** We'll use a stack to keep track of the directories. We'll iterate through each component:
   - If the component is `..`, we'll pop from the stack (go up one level, if possible).
   - If the component is `.` or empty (resulting from multiple slashes), we'll ignore it.
   - Otherwise, we'll push the component onto the stack.
3. **Construct the Canonical Path:** Finally, we'll construct the canonical path by joining the components in the stack with slashes and ensuring it starts with a slash.

Original Question: Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return _the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`_.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

*   Delete a character
*   Replace a character

**Example 1:**

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Edit Distance, which is a way of quantifying how different two strings are by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other. The operations allowed are insertion, deletion, and substitution of a single character.

### Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - We'll use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of operations to convert the first `i` characters of `word1` to the first `j` characters of `word2`.
   
2. **Base Cases**:
   - If one of the strings is empty, the number of operations is the length of the other string (all insertions or deletions).

3. **State Transition**:
   - If the characters at positions `i-1` and `j-1` are the same, no operation is needed, so `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.
   - If the characters are different, we consider the minimum of three operations:
     - Replace the character: `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`
     - Insert a character: `dp[i][j-1] + 1`
     - Delete a character: `dp[i-1][j] + 1`

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to set entire rows and columns to zero in a given matrix whenever we encounter a zero in any cell, and we have to do this in place, meaning we shouldn't use extra space beyond a few variables.

### Approach

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - Determine the number of rows (`num_rows`) and columns (`num_cols`) in the matrix.
   
2. **Identify Zero Positions:**
   - Use two sets, `zero_rows` and `zero_cols`, to record the rows and columns that contain zeros.
   - Iterate through the matrix, and for each cell that contains zero, add its row and column indices to the respective sets.
   
3. **Set Rows and Columns to Zero:**
   - For each row index in `zero_rows`, set all elements in that row to zero.
   - For each column index in `zero_cols`, set all elements in that column to zero.

This approach ensures that we only use additional space proportional to the number of rows and columns containing zeros, which is `O(m + n)`. However, the problem asks for a constant space solution, which would be `O(1)` additional space.

We are required to solve this in O(log(m * n)) time complexity, which suggests using a binary search approach.

### Approach

1. **Binary Search on Rows:**
   - First, we perform a binary search on the rows to find the potential row where the target could exist. This is based on the last element of each row since the first element of each row is greater than the last element of the previous row.

2. **Binary Search on Columns:**

Original Question: Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them **[in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,0,2,1,1,0\]
**Output:** \[0,0,1,1,2,2\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,0,1\]
**Output:** \[0,1,2\]

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 300`
*   `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

**Follow up:** Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?

**Follow up:** Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use the Dutch National Flag algorithm, which is an efficient in-place sorting algorithm for sorting an array of three distinct elements. In this case, the three colors are represented by the integers 0, 1, and 2.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We will use three pointers: `low`, `mid`, and `high`.
   - `low` pointer will track the end of the section containing 0s.
   - `mid` pointer will traverse the array.
   - `high` pointer will track the start of the section containing 2s.

2. **Traversal**:
   - We will iterate through the array with the `mid` pointer from the start to the `high` pointer.
   - If the element at `mid` is 0, we swap it with the element at `low` and increment both `low` and `mid`.
   - If the element at `mid` is 1, we leave it in place and just increment `mid`.
   - If the element at `mid` is 2, we swap it with the element at `high` and decrement `high` without incrementing `mid` because the new element at `mid` after swap might need to be processed.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop continues until `mid` is greater than `high`.

This algorithm ensures that all 0s are moved to the beginning, all 1s are in the middle, and all 2s are at the end of the array, sorted in linear time O(n) and constant space O(1).

### Solution Code
Response: python
def sortColors(nums):
    low = 0
    mid = 0
    high = len(nums) - 1

    while mid <= high:
        if nums[mid] == 0:
            nums[low], nums[mid] = nums[mid], nums[low]
            low += 1
            mid += 1
        elif nums[mid] == 1:
            mid += 1
        else:
            nums[mid], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[mid]
            high -= 1

Original Question: Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return _the **minimum window**_ **_substring_** _of_ `s` _such that every character in_ `t` _(**including duplicates**) is included in the window_. If there is no such substring, return _the empty string_ `" "`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "ADOBECODEBANC ", t =  "ABC "
**Output:**  "BANC "
**Explanation:** The minimum window substring  "BANC " includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "a ", t =  "a "
**Output:**  "a "
**Explanation:** The entire string s is the minimum window.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "a ", t =  "aa "
**Output:**  " "
**Explanation:** Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest substring in string `s` that contains all the characters from string `t`, including duplicates. This is commonly known as the "Minimum Window Substring" problem.

### Approach

1. **Sliding Window Technique**: We'll use a sliding window approach to efficiently solve this problem. The idea is to maintain a window within `s` that contains all characters of `t` and keep moving the window to find the smallest such substring.

2. **Character Frequency Counters**: We'll use dictionaries to count the frequency of each character in `t` and keep track of the frequencies of characters in the current window of `s`.

3. **Window Expansion and Contraction**:
   - Start with two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window in `s`.
   - Expand the `right` pointer to include more characters until the window contains all characters from `t`.
   - Once the window contains all characters from `t`, try to contract the window from the left to find the smallest such window.
   - Repeat the process until the `right` pointer reaches the end of `s`.

4. **Tracking the Minimum Window**: Keep track of the minimum window found during the expansion and contraction of the window.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def minWindow(s, t):
    from collections import Counter

    # Frequency counter for characters in t
    t_counter = Counter(t)
    required = len(t_counter)

    # Pointers for the sliding window
    left = 0
    right = 0

    # Count of unique characters in the current window that match the required frequency
    formed = 0

    # Dictionary to keep track of frequencies of characters in the current window
    window_counter = {}

    # Initialize variables to store the minimum window
    min_length = float('inf')
    min_left = 0

    while right < len(s):
        # Add the current character to the window counter
        character = s[right]
        window_counter[character] = window_counter.get(character, 0) + 1

        # If the frequency of the current character matches the required frequency
        if character in t_counter and window_counter[character] == t_counter[character]:
            formed += 1

        # Try to contract the window from the left
        while left <= right and formed == required:
            character = s[left]

            # Update the minimum window if the current window is smaller
            if right - left + 1 < min_length:
                min_length = right - left + 1
                min_left = left

            # Remove the leftmost character from the window counter
            window_counter[character] -= 1
            if character in t_counter and window_counter[character] < t_counter[character]:
                formed -= 1

            # Move the left pointer to the right
            left += 1

        # Move the right pointer to the right
        right += 1

    # Return the minimum window or an empty string if no such window exists
    return s[min_left:min_left + min_length] if min_length!= float('inf') else " "

# Example usage:

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1, k = 1

**Explanation:** There is 1 choose 1 = 1 total combination.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 20`
*   `1 <= k <= n`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to generate all possible combinations of `k` numbers from the range `[1, n]`. Combinations are subsets of the specified size, and the order in which they are produced does not matter.

## Approach

We can use a backtracking approach to generate combinations. Backtracking is a systematic way to iterate through all possible configurations of a search space. Here's how it works for this problem:

1. **Initialization**: We'll start with an empty combination and build it up one number at a time.
2. **Choice**: At each step, we choose a number from the range `[1, n]` to add to the current combination.
3. **Constraints**: We ensure that we don't exceed the combination size `k` and that we don't reuse numbers in the same combination.
4. **Goal**: When the combination reaches size `k`, we add it to our result list.
5. **Backtrack**: After adding a number, we recurse with the next numbers and then remove the last added number to explore other possibilities.

To optimize, we'll start our choices from the next available number to avoid duplicates and ensure that combinations are in increasing order.

## Solution Code
Response: python
def combine(n, k):
    def backtrack(start, path):
        # If the combination is of size k, add a copy to the result
        if len(path) == k:
            result.append(path[:])
            return
        # Iterate through all possible choices from'start' to 'n'
        for i in range(start, n + 1):
            # Choose
            path.append(i)
            # Explore
            backtrack(i + 1, path)
            # Unchoose
            path.pop()

### Approach

1. **Backtracking**: We can use a backtracking approach to generate all subsets. The idea is to build subsets incrementally by choosing or not choosing each element in the array.

2. **Recursive Function**: We define a recursive function that takes the current index in the array and the current subset being built. At each step, we have two choices:
   - Include the current element in the subset.

**Follow up:** Could you use search pruning to make your solution faster with a larger `board`?
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore the grid and check if the word can be formed by traversing adjacent cells.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We are given a 2D grid of characters (`board`) and a target word (`word`).
   - We need to determine if the word exists in the grid by moving horizontally or vertically to adjacent cells without reusing the same cell more than once.

2. **DFS Function**:
   - We define a DFS function that takes the current position in the grid (`row`, `col`), the current index in the word (`index`), and the board with a visited mask.
   - The DFS function checks if the current cell matches the current character in the word and explores all possible directions (up, down, left, right) recursively.
   - We use a visited mask to keep track of cells already used in the current path.

3. **Main Function**:
   - Iterate through each cell in the grid to start the DFS from every possible cell.
   - If the DFS from any starting cell returns `True`, then the word exists in the grid.

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove some duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears **at most twice**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` _after placing the final result in the first_ `k` _slots of_ `nums`.

Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array
int\[\] expectedNums = \[...\]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums\[i\] == expectedNums\[i\];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,1,2,2,3\]
**Output:** 5, nums = \[1,1,2,2,3,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3\]
**Output:** 7, nums = \[0,0,1,1,2,3,3,\_,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums\[i\] == expectedNums\[i\];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,1,2,2,3\]
**Output:** 5, nums = \[1,1,2,2,3,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3\]
**Output:** 7, nums = \[0,0,1,1,2,3,3,\_,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
*   `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to remove duplicates from a sorted array such that each unique element appears at most twice. We must do this in-place with O(1) extra memory.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We'll use a pointer `k` to track the position in the array where the next non-duplicate element should be placed.
   - We'll use a counter to keep track of the number of times a particular element has appeared.

2. **Traversal**:
   - We'll iterate through the array with another pointer `i`.
   - For each element, we'll check if it's the same as the element at position `k-1` and `k-2`.
   - If it is the same as both, we'll skip it (since we already have two instances).
   - Otherwise, we'll place it at position `k` and increment `k`.

3. **Return**:
   - The value of `k` will be the length of the array after removing duplicates beyond two occurrences.

### Solution Code

def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if len(nums) <= 2:

            nums[k] = nums[i]
            k += 1

Original Question: There is an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with **distinct** values).

Before being passed to your function, `nums` is **rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`0 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `5` and become `[4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the rotation and an integer `target`, return `true` _if_ `target` _is in_ `nums`_, or_ `false` _if it is not in_ `nums`_._

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,5,6,0,0,1,2\], target = 0
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,5,6,0,0,1,2\], target = 3
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
*   `nums` is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
*   `-104 <= target <= 104`

**Follow up:** This problem is similar to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, but `nums` may contain **duplicates**. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?

**Follow up:** This problem is similar to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, but `nums` may contain **duplicates**. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?
CoT: So I've got this problem here. It's about searching for a target value in a rotated sorted array that may contain duplicates. The array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, but then it was rotated at some pivot unknown to me. My task is to find out if the target value is present in the array, returning true if it is and false otherwise. The catch is that I need to do this as efficiently as possible, minimizing the number of operations.

First, I need to understand the nature of the problem. In a regular sorted array without duplicates and without rotation, a simple binary search would suffice, which runs in O(log n) time. However, the array here is both rotated and may contain duplicates, which complicates things.

Let me think about the rotation. Rotation means that the array is split into two parts at some pivot point, and these two parts are swapped. For example, if the original array was [0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7], and it's rotated at pivot 5, it becomes [4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4]. So, the array is still somewhat sorted, but not completely.

In a rotated sorted array without duplicates, I can still use a modified binary search where I adjust the search based on which part of the array is actually sorted at each step. But since there are duplicates here, that complicates things further because duplicates can make it harder to determine which part is sorted.

Let me consider an example to illustrate this. Take nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0. In this case, the array is rotated, and there are duplicates (the two 0's). I need to find out if 0 is present, which it is, so the function should return true.

Another example: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3. Here, 3 is not in the array, so return false.

Okay, so how do I approach this?

I know that in a standard binary search, I look at the middle element and decide which half to proceed with based on whether the target is greater or smaller than the middle element. In a rotated sorted array, I need to consider which part is actually sorted and make decisions based on that.

Let me outline a plan:

1. Initialize two pointers, low and high, to the start and end of the array, respectively.

2. While low <= high:

a. Calculate mid = (low + high) // 2

b. If nums[mid] == target, return true

c. Else, determine which part of the array is sorted:

i. If nums[low] < nums[mid], then the left part is sorted.

ii. Else if nums[low] > nums[mid], then the right part is sorted.

iii. Else, nums[low] == nums[mid], which means there are duplicates, and I can't be sure which part is sorted. In this case, I'll have to increment low by 1 to skip the duplicate.

3. Based on which part is sorted, decide where the target might be present and adjust the pointers accordingly.

Wait, but in the case where nums[low] == nums[mid], I can't determine which side is sorted. For example, in [2,2,2,0,2,2,2], it's hard to tell. In such cases, the best I can do is to increment low by 1 and retry.

Let me try to write this logic more concretely.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

- Set low = 0, high = len(nums) - 1

- While low <= high:

- mid = (low + high) // 2

- If nums[mid] == target, return true

- If nums[low] < nums[mid]: # left side is sorted

- If target >= nums[low] and target < nums[mid]:

- high = mid - 1

- Else:

- low = mid + 1

- Elif nums[low] > nums[mid]: # right side is sorted

- If target > nums[mid] and target <= nums[high]:

- low = mid + 1

- Else:

- high = mid - 1

- Else: # nums[low] == nums[mid]

- If nums[low]!= target:

- low += 1

- Else:

- return true

Wait, in the else case, if nums[low] == nums[mid], and nums[low]!= target, I can safely increment low by 1 to skip the duplicate. If nums[low] == target, then I can return true immediately.

But I need to be careful here. If nums[low] == nums[mid], and nums[low]!= target, I can skip the low pointer by incrementing it, but I need to ensure that I don't skip over the target. However, since nums[low] == nums[mid], and nums[mid]!= target, it's safe to skip low because the target cannot be between low and mid in this case.

Let me test this logic with the example:

nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0

Initial low = 0, high = 6, mid = 3, nums[mid] = 0 == target, return true.

Another example: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3

low = 0, high = 6, mid = 3, nums[mid] = 0!= 3

nums[low] = 2 > nums[mid] = 0, so right side is sorted.

Check if 3 > 0 and 3 <= 2? 3 <= 2 is false, so high = mid - 1 = 2

Now low = 0, high = 2, mid = 1, nums[mid] = 5!= 3

nums[low] = 2 < nums[mid] = 5, so left side is sorted.

Check if 3 >= 2 and 3 < 5? Yes, so high = mid - 1 = 0

Now low = 0, high = 0, mid = 0, nums[mid] = 2!= 3

nums[low] = 2 == nums[mid] = 2, and 2!= 3, so low += 1, low = 1

Now low > high, exit loop, return false.

Seems correct.

Another test case: nums = [1,0,1,1,1], target = 0

low = 0, high = 4, mid = 2, nums[mid] = 1!= 0

nums[low] = 1 > nums[mid] = 1, so right side is sorted.

Check if 0 > 1 and 0 <= 4? 0 > 1 is false, so high = mid - 1 = 1

Now low = 0, high = 1, mid = 0, nums[mid] = 1!= 0

nums[low] = 1 == nums[mid] = 1, and 1!= 0, so low += 1, low = 1

Now low = 1, high = 1, mid = 1, nums[mid] = 0 == target, return true.

Good.

Edge case: nums = [1], target = 1 -> return true

nums = [1], target = 0 -> return false

nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], target = 0 -> should return true

This array is all 1's except for one 0. The rotation could be anywhere.

Alright, I think this logic should work. Now, about the complexity.

In the best case, when there are no duplicates or the duplicates don't interfere, the complexity remains O(log n). However, in the worst case, where there are many duplicates, the complexity can degrade to O(n). For example, in an array like [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1], the algorithm might need to skip duplicates one by one, leading to linear time complexity.

So, duplicates can affect the runtime complexity, making it less efficient in the worst-case scenario.

In summary, the presence of duplicates can lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(n), but in cases where duplicates are fewer or absent, it remains O(log n).

Now, I'll proceed to implement this in Python.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given target value exists in a rotated sorted array that may contain duplicates. The array is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot, and our task is to perform this check as efficiently as possible.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: We use two pointers, `low` and `high`, to maintain the current search space.
2. **Binary Search with Adjustments**:
   - Calculate the middle index `mid`.
   - If `nums[mid]` is equal to the `target`, return `True`.
   - If the left half is sorted (`nums[low] < nums[mid]`):
     - Check if the `target` lies within the left sorted half. If yes, adjust the `high` pointer.
     - Otherwise, adjust the `low` pointer.
   - If the right half is sorted (`nums[low] > nums[mid]`):
     - Check if the `target` lies within the right sorted half. If yes, adjust the `low` pointer.
     - Otherwise, adjust the `high` pointer.
   - If `nums[low]` is equal to `nums[mid]`, we cannot determine which half is sorted. Increment `low` to skip duplicate values.
3. **Termination**: If the search space is exhausted without finding the target, return `False`.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def search(nums, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(nums) - 1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return True
        
        if nums[low] < nums[mid]:
            # Left side is sorted
            if target >= nums[low] and target < nums[mid]:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the largest rectangular area in a histogram represented by an array of integers, where each integer represents the height of a bar and the width of each bar is 1.

### Approach

1. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - For each bar, calculate the maximum area considering it as the smallest bar.
   - For every bar at position `i`, iterate through all bars from `j` to `k` where `j <= i <= k` and all bars from `j` to `k` are greater than or equal to `heights[i]`.
   - Calculate the area as `(k - j + 1) * heights[i]` and keep track of the maximum area.
   - This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is inefficient for large arrays.

2. **Optimized Approach Using Stacks**:
   - Use a stack to keep track of bars that are potential candidates for the largest rectangle.
   - Iterate through the array, and for each bar, while the stack is not empty and the current bar's height is less than the bar at the top of the stack:
     - Pop the bar from the stack.
     - Calculate the area with the popped bar as the smallest bar.
     - Update the maximum area if necessary.
   - Push the current bar's index onto the stack.
   - After iterating through the array, pop any remaining bars from the stack and calculate their areas considering the right boundary as the end of the array.
   - This approach has a time complexity of O(n), which is efficient for large arrays.

**Input:** matrix = \[\[ "1 ", "0 ", "1 ", "0 ", "0 "\],\[ "1 ", "0 ", "1 ", "1 ", "1 "\],\[ "1 ", "1 ", "1 ", "1 ", "1 "\],\[ "1 ", "0 ", "0 ", "1 ", "0 "\]\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** matrix = \[\[ "0 "\]\]
**Output:** 0

**Example 3:**

**Input:** matrix = \[\[ "1 "\]\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `rows == matrix.length`
*   `cols == matrix[i].length`
*   `1 <= row, cols <= 200`
*   `matrix[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach combined with the largest rectangle in histogram algorithm. The idea is to treat each row of the matrix as the base of a histogram, where the height of each bar in the histogram is determined by the number of consecutive '1's above it in the column.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialize Heights Array:** 
   - Create an array `heights` of size `cols`, where `heights[j]` represents the height of the histogram at column `j` for the current row.

2. **Iterate Through Each Row:**
   - For each row in the matrix, update the `heights` array:
     - If the cell is '1', increment the height from the previous row's height plus one.
     - If the cell is '0', set the height to zero since a '0' breaks the sequence of '1's.

3. **Calculate Maximum Rectangle in Histogram:**
   - For each updated `heights` array, calculate the maximum area of a rectangle in the histogram using the largest rectangle in histogram algorithm.
   - Keep track of the maximum area found across all rows.

4. **Largest Rectangle in Histogram Algorithm:**
   - Use a stack to keep track of bars that are being considered for forming a rectangle.
   - Iterate through the bars, and for each bar, while the stack is not empty and the current bar's height is less than the bar at the top of the stack:
     - Calculate the area with the top of the stack as the smallest bar.
     - Pop the top bar.
   - Push the current bar onto the stack.
   - After processing all bars, handle any remaining bars in the stack similarly.

5. **Return the Maximum Area Found:**
   - After processing all rows, return the maximum area found.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum rectangle area by reusing the heights from previous rows and applying the histogram algorithm for each row.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the largest rectangle containing only '1's in a given binary matrix and return its area. We will use a dynamic programming approach combined with the largest rectangle in histogram algorithm.

### Approach

1. **Initialize Heights Array:**
   - Create an array `heights` to represent the height of histograms for each column.

2. **Iterate Through Each Row:**
   - For each row in the matrix:
     - Update the `heights` array where `heights[j]` is incremented by 1 if `matrix[i][j]` is '1', otherwise set to 0.
     - Calculate the maximum area of a rectangle in the current histogram using the largest rectangle in histogram algorithm.

3. **Largest Rectangle in Histogram Algorithm:**
   - Use a stack to keep track of bars that are being considered for forming a rectangle.
   - For each bar, adjust the stack to calculate the maximum area that can be formed with the current bar as the smallest bar.

4. **Track Maximum Area:**
   - Keep track of the maximum area found across all rows and return it.

Original Question: Given the `head` of a linked list and a value `x`, partition it such that all nodes **less than** `x` come before nodes **greater than or equal** to `x`.

You should **preserve** the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[1,4,3,2,5,2\], x = 3
**Output:** \[1,2,2,4,3,5\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[2,1\], x = 2
**Output:** \[1,2\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 200]`.

*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to partition a given linked list such that all nodes with values less than a given value `x` come before nodes with values greater than or equal to `x`. Additionally, we must maintain the original relative order of the nodes in each partition.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create two dummy nodes: one for nodes with values less than `x` (`before`) and another for nodes with values greater than or equal to `x` (`after`).
   - Use two pointers (`beforePtr` and `afterPtr`) to track the current ends of these two partitions.

2. **Traversal and Partitioning**:
   - Traverse the original linked list starting from the head.
   - For each node, if its value is less than `x`, append it to the `before` partition; otherwise, append it to the `after` partition.
   - This ensures that the original order is preserved within each partition.

3. **Connecting Partitions**:
   - After traversing the entire list, connect the end of the `before` partition to the start of the `after` partition.
   - Set the next pointer of the last node in the `after` partition to `None` to terminate the list properly.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - The new head of the modified list will be the next node of the `before` dummy node.

Original Question: We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:

1.  If the length of the string is 1, stop.
2.  If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
    *   Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is `s`, divide it to `x` and `y` where `s = x + y`.
    *   **Randomly** decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, `s` may become `s = x + y` or `s = y + x`.
    *   Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings `x` and `y`.

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of **the same length**, return `true` if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  "great ", s2 =  "rgeat "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
 "great " -->  "gr/eat " // divide at random index.
 "gr/eat " -->  "gr/eat " // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
 "gr/eat " -->  "g/r / e/at " // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
 "g/r / e/at " -->  "r/g / e/at " // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
 "r/g / e/at " -->  "r/g / e/ a/t " // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide  "at " to  "a/t ".
 "r/g / e/ a/t " -->  "r/g / e/ a/t " // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is  "rgeat " which is s2.
As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  "abcde ", s2 =  "caebd "
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  "a ", s2 =  "a "
**Output:** true

*   `s1.length == s2.length`
*   `1 <= s1.length <= 30`

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if one string can be obtained from another by recursively scrambling its substrings. This is a classic problem that can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming.

### Approach

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If both strings are identical, return `True`.
   - If the lengths of the strings are different or they have different character counts, return `False`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - Use a 3D dictionary to store the results of subproblems. The keys will be tuples representing the start and end indices of substrings in both strings.

3. **Recursive Function**:
   - Define a recursive function that checks if a substring of `s1` from `i` to `j` can be scrambled to match a substring of `s2` from `k` to `l`.
   - For each possible split position, check if the left and right parts can be scrambled to match correspondingly, considering both the same order and swapped order.

4. **Memoization**:
   - Use the dictionary to memoize the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations.

Original Question: You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array_ `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,2,3,0,0,0\], m = 3, nums2 = \[2,5,6\], n = 3
**Output:** \[1,2,2,3,5,6\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[1,2,3\] and \[2,5,6\].
The result of the merge is \[1,2,2,3,5,6\] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1\], m = 1, nums2 = \[\], n = 0
**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[1\] and \[\].
The result of the merge is \[1\].

**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[\] and \[1\].
The result of the merge is \[1\].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to merge two sorted arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, into `nums1` such that `nums1` contains the sorted combination of both arrays. The arrays are already sorted in non-decreasing order, and `nums1` has enough space at the end to hold the elements of `nums2`.

### Approach

1. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Since both arrays are sorted, we can use two pointers to traverse both arrays from the end simultaneously. This way, we can place the largest elements at the end of `nums1` first, moving backwards.

2. **Merge from the End**: By starting from the end of both arrays, we avoid overwriting elements in `nums1` that haven't been considered yet.

3. **Handle Remaining Elements**: After merging, if there are any remaining elements in `nums2`, they are already in the correct position in `nums1`.

Response: python
def merge(nums1, m, nums2, n):

### Approach

2. **Generating Gray Code Sequence**:
   - We will generate Gray codes for all numbers from 0 to 2^n - 1.
   - For each number i in this range, compute its Gray code using the formula `i XOR (i >> 1)`.
   - Collect these Gray codes in a list.

3. **Ensuring Properties**:
   - The sequence starts with 0.
   - Each pair of adjacent numbers in the sequence differs by exactly one bit.
   - The first and last numbers in the sequence differ by exactly one bit.

Attacked Question: Given an integer array `nums` that may contain duplicates, return _all possible_ _subsets_ _(the power set)_.

The solution set **must not** contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,2\]
**Output:** \[\[\],\[1\],\[1,2\],\[1,2,2\],\[2\],\[2,2\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0\]
**Output:** \[\[\],\[0\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 10`
*   `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to generate all possible subsets of the given array `nums`, including the empty subset and the full set, while ensuring that there are no duplicate subsets in the result. Since the array may contain duplicates, we have to handle these duplicates carefully to avoid generating duplicate subsets.

### Approach

1. **Sorting the Array**: By sorting the array first, we group duplicate elements together, which makes it easier to skip over duplicates and avoid creating duplicate subsets.

2. **Backtracking**: We use a backtracking approach to generate all possible subsets. Backtracking is a systematic way to iterate through all possible configurations of a problem by building candidates incrementally and abandoning a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot lead to a valid solution.

3. **Skipping Duplicates**: During the backtracking process, when we encounter duplicate elements, we skip them to prevent generating duplicate subsets. This is done by checking if the current element is the same as the previous one in the sorted array.

### Solution Code

    def backtrack(start, path):
        res.append(path[:])

Original Question: A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be **encoded** into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' ->  "1 "
'B' ->  "2 "
...
'Z' ->  "26 "

To **decode** an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `"11106 "` can be mapped into:

*   `"AAJF "` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`
*   `"KJF "` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`

Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `"06 "` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `"6 "` is different from `"06 "`.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return _the **number** of ways to **decode** it_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "12 "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:**  "12 " could be decoded as  "AB " (1 2) or  "L " (12).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "226 "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**  "226 " could be decoded as  "BZ " (2 26),  "VF " (22 6), or  "BBF " (2 2 6).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "06 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:**  "06 " cannot be mapped to  "F " because of the leading zero ( "6 " is different from  "06 ").

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
*   `s` contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).

**Constraints:**

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to decode a string containing only digits into letters using the mapping 'A' -> "1", 'B' -> "2",..., 'Z' -> "26". We will use dynamic programming to efficiently compute the number of decodings.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We handle special cases where the string is empty or starts with '0' since '0' cannot be decoded.
   - We initialize a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to decode the substring `s[0:i]`.

2. **DP Array Definition**:
   - `dp[0]` is set to 1 because there is one way to decode an empty string.
   - `dp[1]` is set to 1 if the first character is not '0', otherwise 0.

3. **Filling the DP Array**:
   - For each position `i` from 2 to the length of the string:
     - We check if the current digit `s[i-1]` can be decoded alone (i.e., not '0').
     - We check if the last two digits `s[i-2:i]` form a number between 10 and 26, which can be decoded together.
     - We update `dp[i]` based on these checks.

4. **Result**:
   - The value of `dp[n]` where `n` is the length of the string, represents the total number of ways to decode the entire string.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** \[\[1\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 8`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to generate all unique binary search trees (BSTs) with exactly `n` nodes using the values from 1 to `n`. Each BST must satisfy the property that for any node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than its own value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than its own value.

### Approach

1. **Recursive Generation**:
   - We will use a recursive approach to generate all possible BSTs for a given range of values `[start, end]`.
   - For each value `i` in this range, we will consider `i` as the root of the tree and recursively generate all possible left and right subtrees.
   - The left subtree will be generated using values from `[start, i-1]`, and the right subtree will be generated using values from `[i+1, end]`.
   - We will combine each possible left subtree with each possible right subtree to form all possible trees with `i` as the root.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If `start > end`, it means there are no nodes to form a subtree, so we return `[None]`.
   - If `start == end`, there is only one node, so we return a tree with that single node.

3. **Combining Subtrees**:
   - For each root value `i`, we get lists of all possible left and right subtrees.
   - We then iterate through all combinations of left and right subtrees and create a new tree for each combination with `i` as the root.

**Output:** 5

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 19`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of unique binary search trees (BSTs) that can be created with `n` nodes, where each node has a unique value from 1 to `n`. This is a classic problem in computer science and combinatorics, and it can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming.

### Approach

1. **Understanding BST Properties**:
   - In a BST, for any given node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than its own value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than its own value.
   - The structure of a BST is determined by its inorder traversal, which for unique values from 1 to `n` is always 1, 2, 3,..., n.

2. **Catalan Number Relationship**:
   - The number of unique BSTs for `n` nodes is given by the `n`-th Catalan number.
   - The Catalan numbers can be computed using dynamic programming.

3. **Dynamic Programming Solution**:
   - We use a table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with `i` nodes.
   - For each number of nodes `i` from 1 to `n`, we consider each possible root value `j` from 1 to `i`.
   - For each root `j`, the number of unique BSTs is the product of the number of unique BSTs formed by the left subtree (nodes 1 to j-1) and the right subtree (nodes j+1 to i).
   - We sum these products for all possible roots `j` to get `dp[i]`.

### Solution Code

*   `s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
*   `t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
*   `|n - m| <= 1`
*   The **interleaving** is `s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ...` or `t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...`

**Note:** `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  "aabcc ", s2 =  "dbbca ", s3 =  "aadbbcbcac "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 =  "aa " +  "bc " +  "c ", and s2 into s2 =  "dbbc " +  "a ".
Interleaving the two splits, we get  "aa " +  "dbbc " +  "bc " +  "a " +  "c " =  "aadbbcbcac ".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  "aabcc ", s2 =  "dbbca ", s3 =  "aadbbbaccc "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  " ", s2 =  " ", s3 =  " "
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= s3.length <= 200`
*   `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` consist of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it using only `O(s2.length)` additional memory space?

**Follow up:** Could you solve it using only `O(s2.length)` additional memory space?
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if the string `s3` can be formed by interleaving the strings `s1` and `s2`. This means that we need to check if we can construct `s3` by taking characters from `s1` and `s2` in such a way that the relative order of characters from each string is maintained.

### Approach

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If the lengths of `s1` and `s2` do not add up to the length of `s3`, it's impossible for `s3` to be formed by interleaving `s1` and `s2`.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Table**:
   - We use a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the first `i` characters of `s1` and the first `j` characters of `s2` can form the first `i+j` characters of `s3`.
   
3. **DP Initialization**:
   - `dp[0][0]` is `True` because two empty strings can form another empty string.
   - Initialize the first row and column of the DP table:
     - `dp[0][j]` is `True` if the first `j` characters of `s2` match the first `j` characters of `s3`.
     - `dp[i][0]` is `True` if the first `i` characters of `s1` match the first `i` characters of `s3`.
   
4. **DP Transition**:
   - For each position `(i, j)` in the DP table, check if we can reach `dp[i][j]` by either:
     - Taking the `i`-th character from `s1` and matching it with the `(i+j)`-th character of `s3`, provided `dp[i-1][j]` is `True`.
     - Taking the `j`-th character from `s2` and matching it with the `(i+j)`-th character of `s3`, provided `dp[i][j-1]` is `True`.

5. **Result**:
   - The value at `dp[len(s1)][len(s2)]` will tell us if `s3` can be formed by interleaving `s1` and `s2`.

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree, _determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)_.

A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

*   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
*   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
*   Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[2,1,3\]
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[5,1,4,null,null,3,6\]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
*   `-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`
Attacked Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree, _determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)_.

A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

*   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
*   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
*   Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[2,1,3\]
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[5,1,4,null,null,3,6\]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
*   `-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST). A BST has the property that for every node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than its own value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than its own value. Additionally, both subtrees must also be BSTs.

### Approach

1. **Recursive Validation with Bounds**:
   - We can validate the BST by recursively checking each node while maintaining a valid range for its value.
   - Initially, the root node can have any value within the limits of a 32-bit signed integer.
   - For each left child node, the upper bound is the value of its parent, and for each right child node, the lower bound is the value of its parent.
   - If any node violates this range, the tree is not a valid BST.

2. **Initialization**:
   - We start with the root node and initialize the lower and upper bounds to the smallest and largest possible integer values, respectively.

3. **Recursive Function**:
   - Define a helper function that takes a node and its allowed lower and upper bounds.
   - If the node is `None`, it is considered a valid BST.
   - If the node's value is outside the allowed bounds, it is not a valid BST.
   - Recursively validate the left and right subtrees with updated bounds.

    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):

Original Question: You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of **exactly** two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. _Recover the tree without changing its structure_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,3,null,null,2\]
**Output:** \[3,1,null,null,2\]

CoT: I'm going to solve this problem of recovering a binary search tree (BST) where exactly two nodes have been swapped incorrectly. The goal is to fix the tree by swapping them back without changing the tree's structure.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - In a BST, the inorder traversal produces a sorted list of values.
   - If two nodes are swapped, the inorder traversal will have two elements out of order.
   
2. **Inorder Traversal**:
   - Perform an inorder traversal to identify the nodes that are out of place.
   - During traversal, keep track of the previous node to compare with the current node.
   
3. **Identifying the Swapped Nodes**:
   - There can be two scenarios:
     - The two swapped nodes are adjacent.
     - The two swapped nodes are not adjacent.
   - In both cases, identifying the nodes where the inorder traversal sequence violates the sorted order will help locate the incorrect nodes.
   
4. **Fixing the Tree**:
   - Once the two incorrect nodes are identified, simply swap their values to fix the tree.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if a binary tree is symmetric around its center. This means that the left subtree must be a mirror reflection of the right subtree.

### Approach

1. **Recursive Solution:**
   - We can recursively check if the left subtree and the right subtree are mirrors of each other.
   - For two trees to be mirrors, the following conditions must be met:
     - Their root nodes have the same value.
     - The left subtree of one is mirrored by the right subtree of the other.
     - The right subtree of one is mirrored by the left subtree of the other.

2. **Iterative Solution:**
   - We can use a queue to perform a level-order traversal and check if each level is symmetric.
   - For each level, we check if the node values are symmetric around the center.

Attacked Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values_. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[3,9,20,null,null,15,7\]
**Output:** \[\[3\],\[20,9\],\[15,7\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[1\]
**Output:** \[\[1\]\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to perform a zigzag level order traversal on a binary tree. This means that for each level of the tree, we traverse the nodes from left to right for one level and from right to left for the next level, alternating between the two directions.

### Approach

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** We will use a BFS approach to traverse the tree level by level. BFS is naturally suited for level-order traversal using a queue.

2. **Direction Toggle:** We will maintain a flag to indicate the current direction of traversal for each level. This flag will toggle between left-to-right and right-to-left for each level.

3. **Deque for Efficient Insertion:** To handle the zigzag order efficiently, we will use a deque (double-ended queue). This allows us to append nodes to the front or back of the queue depending on the current direction.

A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[3,9,20,null,null,15,7\]
**Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum depth of a binary tree. The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

### Approach
We can solve this problem using a recursive approach. The idea is to calculate the maximum depth of the left subtree and the right subtree and then take the maximum of these two depths, adding 1 for the root node.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Base Case:** If the tree is empty (i.e., the root is `None`), the depth is 0.
2. **Recursive Case:** 
   - Recursively find the maximum depth of the left subtree.
   - Recursively find the maximum depth of the right subtree.
   - The maximum depth of the tree is the maximum of the depths of the left and right subtrees plus 1 (for the root node).

3. **Recursive Construction**:
   - Identify the root from the postorder list.
   - Find the root value in the inorder list to split it into left and right subtrees.
   - Recursively construct the right subtree first (since postorder processes left-right-root).
   - Then construct the left subtree.

4. **Optimizations**:
   - Use a dictionary to store the indices of inorder values for O(1) lookups.
   - Use pointers to track the current root in the postorder list and the subtrees in the inorder list.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in `head` is in the range `[0, 2 * 104]`.
*   `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to convert a sorted singly-linked list into a height-balanced binary search tree (BST). The key points to consider are:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output:**
   - Input: The head of a singly-linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order.
   - Output: The root of a height-balanced BST.

2. **Height-Balanced BST:**
   - A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

3. **Approach:**
   - To create a height-balanced BST from a sorted array, we can pick the middle element as the root, then recursively do the same for the left and right halves.
   - Since we have a linked list, we need an efficient way to find the middle element.

4. **Efficiently Finding the Middle Element:**
   - We can use the "two pointers" technique (slow and fast pointers) to find the middle element of the linked list in O(N) time.
   - Once we have the middle element, we can make it the root of the BST and recursively construct the left and right subtrees from the left and right halves of the list.

5. **Time and Space Complexity:**
   - Time Complexity: O(N log N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because each level of recursion processes all elements, and the height of the recursion tree is log N.
   - Space Complexity: O(log N), due to the recursion stack.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - Empty linked list: Should return None.
   - Single element linked list: Should return a single-node BST.
   - Linked list with duplicates: Although the problem states the list is sorted, duplicates are allowed and should be handled appropriately in the BST.

7. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Define a helper function that takes the head of the linked list and the length of the list, and returns the root of the BST.
   - Use the two pointers technique to find the middle element.
   - Recursively construct the left and right subtrees.
   - Link the subtrees to the root.

8. **Potential Pitfalls:**
   - Correctly handling the pointers while splitting the linked list into halves.
   - Ensuring that the linked list is split correctly without losing track of the remaining elements.

9. **Testing:**
   - Test with the provided examples.
   - Test with edge cases like an empty list, a single element list, and lists with duplicates.
   - Verify that the resulting BST is height-balanced.

10. **Optimization:**
    - Avoid redundant traversals of the linked list.
    - Ensure that each recursive call gets the correct subset of the linked list.

By following these steps and considerations, we can successfully convert the sorted linked list into a height-balanced BST.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[3,9,20,null,null,15,7\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
*   `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if a binary tree is height-balanced. A binary tree is considered height-balanced if for every node in the tree, the height difference between its left and right subtrees is no more than 1.

### Approach

1. **Depth Calculation**: For each node, calculate the depth of its left and right subtrees.
2. **Balance Check**: Check if the absolute difference between the depths of the left and right subtrees is no more than 1.
3. **Recursive Traversal**: Traverse the tree recursively to check the balance condition for every node.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[3,9,20,null,null,15,7\]
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum depth of a binary tree. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node. A leaf node is a node with no children.

### Approach

1. **Base Case:** If the tree is empty (i.e., the root is `None`), the minimum depth is 0.
2. **Leaf Node:** If the root node is a leaf node (i.e., both left and right children are `None`), the minimum depth is 1.
3. **One Child Missing:** If one of the children is `None` and the other is not, we need to explore the non-None child and add 1 for the root.
4. **Both Children Present:** If both children are present, we recursively find the minimum depth of both subtrees and take the smaller one, then add 1 for the root.

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return `true` if the tree has a **root-to-leaf** path such that adding up all the values along the path equals `targetSum`.

A **leaf** is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1\], targetSum = 22
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3\], targetSum = 5
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
(1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
(1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = \[\], targetSum = 0
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if there is a path from the root of the binary tree to any leaf node such that the sum of the values along this path equals the given `targetSum`.

### Approach

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to check if there is a path from the root to a leaf where the sum of the node values equals `targetSum`.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If the tree is empty (i.e., `root` is `None`), return `False` because there are no paths.
   - If we reach a leaf node (a node with no children), check if the remaining `targetSum` equals the value of this node.

3. **Recursive Approach**:
   - Subtract the current node's value from the `targetSum`.
   - Recursively check both the left and right subtrees with the updated `targetSum`.
   - If either the left or right subtree returns `True`, then there exists a path from the root to a leaf with the desired sum.

A **root-to-leaf** path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A **leaf** is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

**Output:** \[\[5,4,11,2\],\[5,8,4,5\]\]

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree where the sum of the nodes equals a given target sum. We will use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree and keep track of the current path and its sum.

### Approach

1. **Define the TreeNode Class:**
   - We need a class to represent the nodes of the binary tree.

2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - Use a recursive DFS function to traverse from the root to each leaf.
   - Keep track of the current path and the sum of the values in that path.
   - If the current node is a leaf and the path sum equals the target sum, add the path to the result list.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to flatten a binary tree into a linked list using a pre-order traversal approach. The key is to rearrange the tree's nodes such that each node's left child is `null`, and its right child points to the next node in the pre-order traversal sequence.

### Approach

1. **Pre-order Traversal**: In a pre-order traversal, we visit the current node, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree. We need to arrange the tree such that this sequence is maintained in the right child pointers.

2. **Flattening Logic**:
    - We'll use a recursive approach to flatten the left and right subtrees first.
    - After flattening the left and right subtrees, we'll rearrange the pointers:
        - Set the left child of the current node to `null`.
        - Set the right child of the current node to the flattened left subtree.
        - Find the rightmost node in the flattened left subtree and set its right child to the flattened right subtree.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - If the tree is empty (`root` is `null`), do nothing.
    - If the tree has only one node, it is already flattened.

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node \*left;
  Node \*right;
  Node \*next;
}

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3,4,5,6,7\]
**Output:** \[1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#\]
**Explanation:** Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to connect the nodes of a perfect binary tree at the same level using their `next` pointers. We aim to achieve this with constant extra space, which means we should not use any additional data structures like queues or stacks beyond a few variables.

Given that the tree is perfect, every level is fully filled, and all leaves are at the same level. This property allows us to connect nodes level by level efficiently.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**: Start with the root node. If the tree is empty, return NULL.
2. **Connect Nodes**: For each level, starting from the root, connect the nodes from left to right.
3. **Traversal**: Use the `next` pointers of the current level to traverse the next level and set their `next` pointers.

Original Question: Given a binary tree

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node \*left;
  Node \*right;
  Node \*next;
}

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3,4,5,null,7\]
**Output:** \[1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#\]
**Explanation:** Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 6000]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**Follow-up:**

*   You may only use constant extra space.
*   The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

CoT: I'm going to solve this problem of populating next pointers in each node of a binary tree to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL. Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a binary tree where each node has a `next` pointer in addition to the left and right child pointers.
   - We need to connect each node's `next` pointer to its immediate right neighbor on the same level.
   - If there is no right neighbor, the `next` pointer should be set to NULL.

2. **Initial Thoughts:**
   - This problem resembles level order traversal (BFS) of a binary tree, where we process nodes level by level.
   - However, the challenge is to do this using constant extra space, excluding the implicit stack space for recursion.

3. **Proposed Solution:**
   - We'll use a modified BFS approach where we keep track of the current level and the next level's nodes.
   - We'll use a queue to manage the nodes level by level.
   - For each level, we'll connect the nodes from left to right by setting the `next` pointer of each node to the one following it in the queue.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - An empty tree (root is NULL).
   - A tree with only one node.
   - A tree where some nodes have only left or only right children.

### Solution Code
Response: python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.next = next

from collections import deque

    def connect(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':

**Example 1:**

**Input:** numRows = 5
**Output:** \[\[1\],\[1,1\],\[1,2,1\],\[1,3,3,1\],\[1,4,6,4,1\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** numRows = 1
**Output:** \[\[1\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= numRows <= 30`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to generate the first `numRows` rows of Pascal's triangle. Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. Each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We start by handling the base case where `numRows` is 0. In this case, we return an empty list.
   - For any `numRows` greater than 0, we initialize the triangle with the first row, which is always `[1]`.

2. **Building the Triangle**:
   - For each subsequent row, we calculate its values based on the previous row.
   - Each row starts and ends with 1.
   - The middle elements of the row are the sum of two consecutive elements from the previous row.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - We use a loop to build each row one by one, appending it to the result list.
   - To calculate the middle elements, we iterate through the previous row and sum each pair of elements.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def generate(numRows):
    if numRows == 0:

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to generate the rowIndex-th row of Pascal's triangle. Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. Each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Pascal's Triangle:**
   - Row 0: [1]
   - Row 1: [1, 1]
   - Row 2: [1, 2, 1]
   - Row 3: [1, 3, 3, 1]
   -...
   - Row n: [C(n,0), C(n,1),..., C(n,n)]

   Where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient.

2. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - Each element in the row can be calculated using the formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)
   - However, calculating factorials for large n is inefficient and can lead to integer overflow.

3. **Optimized Calculation:**
   - Use the property of binomial coefficients: C(n, k) = C(n, k-1) * (n - k + 1) / k
   - This way, we can compute each element iteratively without calculating large factorials.

4. **Space Optimization:**
   - We only need to store the current row, which reduces space complexity to O(rowIndex).

Original Question: Given a `triangle` array, return _the minimum path sum from top to bottom_.

For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index `i` on the current row, you may move to either index `i` or index `i + 1` on the next row.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** triangle = \[\[2\],\[3,4\],\[6,5,7\],\[4,1,8,3\]\]
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** The triangle looks like:
   2

**Follow up:** Could you do this using only `O(n)` extra space, where `n` is the total number of rows in the triangle?
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to start from the bottom of the triangle and work our way up, calculating the minimum path sum at each step.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. **Initialization**: We'll use the original triangle array to store the minimum path sums. This way, we avoid using extra space beyond what's already allocated for the input.

2. **Bottom-up Calculation**:
   - Start from the second-to-last row of the triangle and move upwards to the top.
   - For each element in the current row, add the minimum of the two adjacent elements from the row below.
   - This step effectively calculates the minimum path sum for each position from bottom to top.

3. **Result**: Once we reach the top of the triangle, the element at triangle[0][0] will hold the minimum path sum from top to bottom.

This approach ensures that we only use O(1) extra space beyond the input array, as we're modifying the input triangle in place. If modifying the input is not allowed, we can use a separate array of size equal to the last row to store intermediate results, which would be O(n) space, where n is the number of rows.

Let's implement this approach in Python.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we use a dynamic programming approach that efficiently calculates the minimum path sum from the top to the bottom of the triangle.

### Approach

1. **Start from the bottom**: We leverage the fact that the minimum path sum for the bottom row is the value of each element itself.
2. **Iterate upwards**: For each element in the triangle, starting from the second-to-last row up to the top:
   - Add the minimum of the two possible adjacent elements from the row below.
3. **Utilize in-place modification**: To optimize space, we use the triangle array itself to store the minimum path sums.

This method ensures that we update each element to represent the minimum path sum from that element to the bottom of the triangle.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def minimumTotal(triangle):
    # Start from the second-to-last row and move upwards
    for row in range(len(triangle) - 2, -1, -1):
        for col in range(len(triangle[row])):
            # For each element, add the minimum of the two adjacent elements below
            triangle[row][col] += min(triangle[row + 1][col], triangle[row + 1][col + 1])
    # The top element now contains the minimum path sum
    return triangle[0][0]

Original Question: You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,1,5,3,6,4\]

**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

**Example 2:**

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling a stock given its prices on different days. We have to buy before we sell, and we can only make one transaction.

### Approach

1. **Initial Thoughts:**
   - We need to find two days: one for buying and one for selling, where the selling day comes after the buying day and the difference in prices is maximized.
   - A brute-force approach would be to consider every pair of days and calculate the profit, then select the maximum. However, this would be inefficient for large arrays.

2. **Efficient Solution:**
   - We can use a single pass approach where we keep track of the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit that can be achieved.
   - As we iterate through the array, we update the minimum price if we find a lower price.
   - We also calculate the profit if we sell on the current day and update the maximum profit if the current profit is higher.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - Initialize `min_price` to a large value and `max_profit` to 0.
   - Iterate through each price in the array:
     - If the current price is lower than `min_price`, update `min_price`.
     - Otherwise, calculate the profit if sold today (current price - `min_price`).
     - If this profit is greater than `max_profit`, update `max_profit`.
   - Return `max_profit`.

Find and return _the **maximum** profit you can achieve_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,1,5,3,6,4\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from buying and selling stocks given the daily prices. We can buy and sell multiple times, but we can only hold at most one share at a time. The key insight is to realize that we should buy and sell whenever there is a price increase between consecutive days.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize a variable `profit` to keep track of the total profit.

2. **Iterate through the prices**:
   - We start from the second day and compare each day's price with the previous day's price.
   - If the price of the current day is higher than the price of the previous day, it means there is a potential profit to be made.
   - We calculate the difference between the current day's price and the previous day's price and add this profit to the total profit.

3. **Return the total profit**:
   - After iterating through all the days, we return the accumulated profit.

**Input:** prices = \[7,6,4,3,1\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 105`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum profit achievable by completing at most two transactions, with the constraint that we cannot engage in multiple transactions simultaneously. This means we must sell a stock before buying again.

### Approach

1. **Initialization:**
   - We need to track the costs and profits for up to two transactions.
   - `cost1`: Cost of the first transaction.
   - `cost2`: Cost of the second transaction.
   - `profit1`: Profit after the first transaction.
   - `profit2`: Profit after the second transaction.

2. **Iterate through the prices:**
   - For each price, update the costs and profits:
     - Update `cost1` to be the minimum price seen so far.
     - Update `profit1` to be the maximum profit after the first sale.
     - Update `cost2` considering the profit from the first transaction.
     - Update `profit2` to be the maximum profit after the second sale.

3. **Final Result:**
   - The maximum profit will be stored in `profit2`.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def maxProfit(prices):
    if not prices:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize variables
    cost1 = float('inf')
    cost2 = float('inf')
    profit1 = 0
    profit2 = 0
    
    for price in prices:
        # Update the cost for the first transaction
        cost1 = min(cost1, price)
        # Update the profit after the first transaction
        profit1 = max(profit1, price - cost1)
        # Update the cost for the second transaction
        # The second buy is after the first sell, so cost2 is minimized by considering profit1
        cost2 = min(cost2, price - profit1)
        # Update the profit after the second transaction
        profit2 = max(profit2, price - cost2)
    
    return profit2

Original Question: A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[-10,9,20,null,null,15,7\]
**Output:** 42
**Explanation:** The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 104]`.
*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum path sum in a binary tree, where a path is defined as a sequence of nodes connected by edges without any node appearing more than once. The path does not necessarily have to pass through the root.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to consider all possible paths in the tree and find the one with the maximum sum.
   - The path can start and end at any node in the tree.

2. **Key Insights:**
   - For any node, the maximum path sum that includes that node can be calculated using the maximum path sums of its left and right subtrees.
   - However, when recursing, we need to decide whether to include the current node in the path or start a new path.

3. **Recursive Function:**
   - Define a recursive function that computes the maximum sum of a path starting from the current node and going downwards (i.e., it does not split at the current node).
   - During this recursion, calculate the maximum path sum that passes through the current node by considering the sums from both subtrees.

4. **Global Maximum:**
   - Maintain a global variable to track the maximum path sum found so far.

Original Question: A phrase is a **palindrome** if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` _if it is a **palindrome**, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**  "amanaplanacanalpanama " is a palindrome.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "race a car "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:**  "raceacar " is not a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "  "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** s is an empty string  " " after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105`
*   `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105`

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases. We will follow these steps:

1. **Preprocess the String**:
   - Convert the entire string to lowercase to ignore case differences.
   - Remove all non-alphanumeric characters from the string.

2. **Check for Palindrome**:
   - Check if the processed string reads the same forwards and backwards.

### Approach

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Use the `lower()` method to convert all characters in the string to lowercase.
   - Use a list comprehension to filter out non-alphanumeric characters. We'll use the `isalnum()` method to check if a character is alphanumeric.

2. **Palindrome Check**:
   - Compare the processed string with its reverse to check if it's a palindrome.

    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:

Original Question: A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk` such that:

*   Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
*   Every `si` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
*   `sk == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return _all the **shortest transformation sequences** from_ `beginWord` _to_ `endWord`_, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words_ `[beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** beginWord =  "hit ", endWord =  "cog ", wordList = \[ "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "lot ", "log ", "cog "\]
**Output:** \[\[ "hit ", "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "cog "\],\[ "hit ", "hot ", "lot ", "log ", "cog "\]\]
**Explanation:** There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
 "hit " ->  "hot " ->  "dot " ->  "dog " ->  "cog "
 "hit " ->  "hot " ->  "lot " ->  "log " ->  "cog "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** beginWord =  "hit ", endWord =  "cog ", wordList = \[ "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "lot ", "log "\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** The endWord  "cog " is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= beginWord.length <= 5`
*   `endWord.length == beginWord.length`
*   `1 <= wordList.length <= 500`
*   `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
*   `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
*   `beginWord != endWord`
*   All the words in `wordList` are **unique**.
*   The **sum** of all shortest transformation sequences does not exceed `105`.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find all the shortest transformation sequences from `beginWord` to `endWord` using the words in `wordList`, where each transformation changes only one letter at a time and each intermediate word must be in `wordList`.

### Approach

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - We can model this problem as a graph traversal problem where each word is a node, and there is an edge between two nodes if they differ by exactly one letter.
   - To efficiently find words that differ by one letter, we can use a hash map to group words by their patterns. For example, for the word "hit", patterns would be "*it", "h*t", "hi*".

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - We use BFS to find the shortest path from `beginWord` to `endWord`. BFS is suitable because it explores all possible transformations level by level.
   - We need to keep track of the path taken to reach each word and also maintain the levels to ensure we only consider the shortest paths.

3. **Path Reconstruction**:
   - Once we reach `endWord` during BFS, we need to reconstruct all possible shortest paths from `beginWord` to `endWord`.

   - Connect two nodes with an edge if the corresponding words differ by exactly one letter.

2. **BFS Traversal**:
   - Start from the `beginWord` and explore all possible transformations step by step.
   - Keep track of the visited words to avoid revisiting them.
   - Use a queue to manage the words to be explored, along with the current path length.

*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest consecutive sequence in an unsorted array of integers. The challenge is to do this in O(n) time complexity.

### Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given an array of integers, which may contain duplicates and is not sorted.
   - We need to find the length of the longest sequence of consecutive numbers.

2. **Initial Thoughts:**
   - Sorting the array would make it easy to find consecutive sequences, but sorting would take O(n log n) time, which is not acceptable.
   - We need a way to process the array in linear time.

3. **Insight:**
   - Use a set to store the unique elements of the array for O(1) lookups.
   - For each number in the set, check if it's the start of a sequence (i.e., no predecessor exists in the set).
   - If it is the start, iterate through the sequence by checking subsequent numbers in the set and count the length of this sequence.

4. **Algorithm:**
   - Convert the array to a set for O(1) lookups.
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the longest sequence length.
   - For each number in the set:
     - If the number minus one is not in the set (i.e., it's the start of a sequence), start counting the sequence length by checking subsequent numbers.
     - Keep track of the maximum length found.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Empty array: return 0.
   - Array with one element: return 1.
   - Array with all elements being the same: return 1.
   - Array with no consecutive numbers: return 1.
   - Array with multiple consecutive sequences: return the length of the longest one.

*   For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.

Return _the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers_. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

A **leaf** node is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** 25
**Explanation:**
The root-to-leaf path `1->2` represents the number `12`.
The root-to-leaf path `1->3` represents the number `13`.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = `25`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[4,9,0,5,1\]
**Output:** 1026
**Explanation:**
The root-to-leaf path `4->9->5` represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path `4->9->1` represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path `4->0` represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = `1026`.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
*   The depth of the tree will not exceed `10`.

*   The depth of the tree will not exceed `10`.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the sum of all numbers formed by the root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree where each node contains a digit from 0 to 9.

### Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Each path from the root to a leaf forms a number.
   - We need to sum all such numbers.

2. **Key Insights:**
   - As we traverse from the root to the leaves, we can build the number step by step.
   - When we move from a node to its child, the number is updated by multiplying the current number by 10 and adding the value of the child node.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - Use a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree.
   - Keep track of the current number as we traverse.
   - When we reach a leaf node, add the current number to the total sum.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Single node tree.
   - Trees with nodes having value 0.
   - Trees with maximum depth and number of nodes.

Original Question: Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, _capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by_ `'X'`.

A region is **captured** by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[ "X ", "X ", "X ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "O ", "O ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "X ", "O ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "O ", "X ", "X "\]\]
**Output:** \[\[ "X ", "X ", "X ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "X ", "X ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "X ", "X ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "O ", "X ", "X "\]\]
**Explanation:** Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\[ "X "\]\]
**Output:** \[\[ "X "\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.

*   `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to capture all regions filled with 'O' that are completely surrounded by 'X' on all sides. The key idea is to identify the 'O's that are connected to the border and cannot be captured, and then flip the remaining 'O's to 'X's.

### Approach

1. **Identify Unflippable 'O's:** 
   - These are the 'O's that are on the border or connected to an 'O' on the border via adjacent 'O's.
   - We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to mark these 'O's as unflippable.

2. **Mark Flippable 'O's:**
   - After identifying the unflippable 'O's, we can iterate through the entire board and flip the remaining 'O's to 'X's.

**Constraints:**

*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of cuts required to partition a given string `s` such that each substring of the partition is a palindrome.

### Approach

1. **Palindrome Check Optimization**:
   - We use dynamic programming to precompute whether the substring from index `i` to `j` is a palindrome. This is stored in a 2D array `is_palindrome`.
   - We iterate over all possible substring lengths and check if the characters at the start and end are the same, and if the substring between them is a palindrome.

2. **Minimum Cuts Calculation**:
   - We use another dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cuts needed for the substring `s[0:i]`.
   - We initialize `dp[i]` to `i-1` (the maximum possible cuts), and update it whenever we find a palindrome substring ending at position `i`.

3. **Efficient Updates**:
   - For each position `i`, we check all previous positions `j` to see if the substring `s[j:i]` is a palindrome.
   - If it is, we update `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

def minCut(s):
    n = len(s)

    # Check for substring of length 2 to n
    for length in range(2, n + 1):
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            if length == 2:

Original Question: Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List neighbors;
}

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\]\]
**Output:** \[\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\]\]
**Explanation:** There are 4 nodes in the graph.

3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\[\]\]

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to create a deep copy of an undirected graph given a reference node. The graph consists of nodes where each node has an integer value and a list of its neighbors. We need to ensure that the cloned graph is a complete copy of the original graph, meaning that all nodes and their connections are duplicated without any reference to the original nodes.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a reference to a node in a connected undirected graph.
   - We need to create a deep copy of the entire graph.
   - Each node has a unique integer value, and a list of neighbors.

2. **Key Points:**
   - The graph is connected, so starting from the given node, we can reach all other nodes.
   - We need to handle the creation of new nodes and ensuring that the neighbor relationships are correctly copied.
   - Avoid cycles and ensure that no node is copied multiple times.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - Use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the graph.
   - Maintain a dictionary to keep track of nodes that have already been visited and copied.
   - For each node, create a new node with the same value and store it in the dictionary.
   - Recursively copy its neighbors.

4. **Steps in Code:**
   - Define a `Node` class to represent the graph nodes.
   - Implement a DFS function that takes a node as input and returns its copy.
   - Use a dictionary to map original nodes to their copies.
   - If a node is already copied, return its copy from the dictionary.
   - Otherwise, create a new node, add it to the dictionary, and recursively copy its neighbors.

### Solution Code

Original Question: There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `ith` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith` station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return _the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return_ `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**

**Example 1:**

**Input:** gas = \[1,2,3,4,5\], cost = \[3,4,5,1,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** gas = \[2,3,4\], cost = \[3,4,3\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == gas.length == cost.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104`

Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** gas = \[2,3,4\], cost = \[3,4,3\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == gas.length == cost.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the starting gas station index from which we can complete a circular route around all stations, given the constraints on gas and cost.

### Approach

1. **Initial Check**:
   - If the total gas available is less than the total cost to travel all stations, it's impossible to complete the circuit, so return -1.

2. **Finding the Starting Point**:
   - Initialize variables to track the total gas in the tank and the starting index.
   - Iterate through each station, updating the total gas by adding the gas at the current station and subtracting the cost to travel to the next station.
   - If at any point the total gas becomes negative, reset the starting index to the next station and reset the total gas to zero.
   - The starting index will be the point from which the cumulative gas never goes negative.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def can_complete_circuit(gas, cost):
    if sum(gas) < sum(cost):
        return -1
    
    total = 0
    start = 0
    for i in range(len(gas)):
        total += gas[i] - cost[i]
        if total < 0:
            start = i + 1
            total = 0
    return start if start < len(gas) else -1

Original Question: There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

*   Each child must have at least one candy.
*   Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return _the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ratings = \[1,0,2\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** ratings = \[1,2,2\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == ratings.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
*   `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104`

*   `n == ratings.length`

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to distribute candies to children in such a way that each child gets at least one candy, and children with higher ratings get more candies than their neighbors. Our goal is to minimize the total number of candies used.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We start by initializing an array `candies` where each child is assigned at least one candy.

2. **Left to Right Pass**:
   - We iterate from left to right. If a child has a higher rating than their left neighbor, we assign them one more candy than their neighbor.

3. **Right to Left Pass**:
   - We then iterate from right to left. If a child has a higher rating than their right neighbor, we assign them the maximum between their current candies and one more than their neighbor's candies.

4. **Summing Up**:
   - Finally, we sum up the candies assigned to each child to get the total minimum candies needed.

### Solution Code

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the element in an array that appears only once while all other elements appear twice, with linear runtime complexity and constant extra space.

### Approach

1. **Bit Manipulation using XOR**:
   - XOR of a number with itself is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.
   - So, XOR of all elements in the array will cancel out the elements appearing twice and leave the unique element.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize a variable `result` to 0.
   - Iterate through each element in the array and XOR it with `result`.
   - The final value of `result` will be the unique element.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the element that appears only once in an array where every other element appears exactly three times. We are required to do this with linear runtime complexity and constant extra space.

### Approach

1. **Bit Manipulation Insight**:
   - Since we're dealing with numbers appearing three times and one appearing once, we can use bitwise operations to track the occurrences.
   - We need to maintain a state for each bit position across all numbers in the array.

2. **Using Two Variables**:
   - We'll use two variables, `once` and `twice`, to track the bits that have appeared once and twice, respectively.
   - For each number in the array, we update these variables:
     - `once` is updated to include bits that are new (not in `once` and not in `twice`).
     - `twice` is updated to include bits that have appeared twice (from `once` to `twice`).
     - If a bit appears for the third time, it should be reset in both `once` and `twice`.

3. **Final Result**:
   - After processing all numbers, the `once` variable will hold the bits of the number that appears only once.

### Solution Code

def singleNumber(nums):
    once = 0
    twice = 0
    for num in nums:
        # Update once and twice with the incoming number

Original Question: A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` **brand new** nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. **None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list**.

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return _the head of the copied linked list_.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

*   `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
*   `random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

Your code will **only** be given the `head` of the original linked list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[\[7,null\],\[13,0\],\[11,4\],\[10,2\],\[1,0\]\]

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to create a deep copy of a linked list where each node has a `next` and a `random` pointer. The challenge lies in correctly copying the `random` pointers, as they can point to any node in the list, including `null`.

### Approach

1. **Initial Thoughts:**
   - We need to create new nodes for each existing node and ensure that the `next` and `random` pointers in the new list correspond to the new nodes, not the original ones.
   - Directly copying pointers won't work because the new nodes don't exist yet.

2. **Insights:**
   - We can use a hash map to keep track of the mapping between original nodes and their corresponding new nodes.
   - By iterating through the list twice, we can first create the new nodes and map them to the original nodes, and then in the second pass, set the `next` and `random` pointers based on this map.

3. **Optimized Solution:**
   - To optimize space, we can use a single pass approach by modifying the original list to interweave the new nodes with the original nodes.
   - This way, we can avoid using extra space for the hash map.

    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):

*   `1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20`
*   `s` and `wordDict[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.
*   All the strings of `wordDict` are **unique**.
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to keep track of positions in the string `s` that can be reached by segmentation using words from the dictionary `wordDict`.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a set from `wordDict` for quick lookups.
   - Initialize a boolean list `dp` of size `n+1`, where `n` is the length of `s`, with all elements set to `False` except `dp[0]`, which is set to `True`. `dp[i]` will be `True` if the substring `s[0:i]` can be segmented into words from the dictionary.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Iterate through the string from left to right.
   - For each position `i` in the string, check all substrings ending at `i`. Specifically, for each `j` from `0` to `i`, check if `dp[j]` is `True` and the substring `s[j:i]` is in the dictionary.
   - If both conditions are satisfied for some `j`, set `dp[i]` to `True` and break out of the inner loop.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - The value of `dp[n]` will indicate whether the entire string can be segmented into words from the dictionary.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible segmentations without redundant computations.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be segmented into a sequence of one or more dictionary words. We will use a dynamic programming approach to efficiently solve this problem.

### Approach

1. **Initialization:**
   - Convert the list of words `wordDict` into a set for O(1) look-up times.
   - Create a dynamic programming array `dp` of size `n+1`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. `dp[i]` will be `True` if the substring `s[0:i]` can be segmented into dictionary words.
   - Set `dp[0]` to `True` because an empty string can always be segmented.

2. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Iterate through the string from index `1` to `n`.
   - For each index `i`, check all substrings ending at `i`. Specifically, for each `j` from `0` to `i`, check if `dp[j]` is `True` and if the substring `s[j:i]` is in the word set.
   - If both conditions are met for any `j`, set `dp[i]` to `True` and break out of the inner loop.

3. **Result:**
   - The value of `dp[n]` will be `True` if the entire string can be segmented into dictionary words, otherwise `False`.

1. **DFS with Backtracking**:
   - We will iterate through the string `s`, checking for substrings that exist in the dictionary.
   - For each valid word found, we will recursively search for the remaining part of the string.
   - We will use backtracking to explore all possible combinations.

2. **Optimization**:
   - To avoid redundant computations, we will use memoization. We will store the results of subproblems (i.e., the results for substrings starting at certain indices) in a dictionary.

Original Question: Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[3,2,0,-4\], pos = 1
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[1,2\], pos = 0
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[1\], pos = -1
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
*   `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if a linked list contains a cycle. A cycle exists if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer.

### Approach

We will use the "Floyd's Tortoise and Hare" algorithm, which is an efficient method for detecting cycles in a linked list. This algorithm uses two pointers: a slow pointer and a fast pointer.

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize both the slow and fast pointers to the head of the linked list.

2. **Traversal:**
   - Move the slow pointer one step at a time.
   - Move the fast pointer two steps at a time.
   - If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer again.

3. **Cycle Detection:**
   - If the fast pointer meets the slow pointer, it indicates the presence of a cycle.
   - If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list (i.e., `None`), it indicates there is no cycle.

            # If they meet, there is a cycle
            if slow == fast:
                return True

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to detect if there is a cycle in a linked list and, if there is, find the node where the cycle begins. This is a classic problem that can be solved using the Floyd's Cycle-Finding algorithm, also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm.

### Approach

1. **Detecting the Cycle:**
   - Use two pointers, a slow pointer and a fast pointer.
   - The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time.
   - If there is a cycle, these two pointers will eventually meet at some point within the cycle.

2. **Finding the Start of the Cycle:**
   - Once the meeting point is found, initialize another pointer at the head of the linked list.
   - Move this pointer and the slow pointer one step at a time.
   - The point at which they meet again is the start of the cycle.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to reorder a given singly linked list such that the first element is followed by the last element, then the second element is followed by the second last element, and so on. We are not allowed to modify the values in the nodes; only the node connections can be changed.

### Approach

1. **Find the Middle of the List:**
   - Use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list.
   - The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time.
   - When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle.

2. **Reverse the Second Half of the List:**
   - Reverse the second half of the list starting from the middle.
   - This can be done by iterating through the second half and reversing the links between nodes.

3. **Merge the Two Halves:**
   - Merge the first half and the reversed second half alternately.
   - Adjust the next pointers to create the reordered list.

CoT: To solve the problem of performing a preorder traversal on a binary tree iteratively, we need to simulate the recursive behavior using a stack. In a preorder traversal, we visit the root node first, then traverse the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.

### Approach
1. **Initialize a Stack:** We'll use a stack to keep track of nodes that we need to visit.
2. **Start with the Root:** Push the root node onto the stack if it exists.
3. **Iterate while the Stack is Not Empty:**
   - Pop a node from the stack and add its value to the result list.
   - Push the right child onto the stack (if it exists), followed by the left child (if it exists). We push the right child first because we want to process the left child before the right child.
4. **Return the Result List:** Once the stack is empty, we have traversed the entire tree in preorder.

**Follow up:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
CoT: To solve the problem of performing a postorder traversal on a binary tree iteratively, we need to understand the postorder traversal process and adapt it to an iterative approach using a stack.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Postorder Traversal**:
   - In postorder traversal, nodes are visited in the order left subtree, right subtree, then the root.
   - For example, in the tree with root node 1 and right child 2 which has a left child 3:
     - Postorder traversal would visit 3, then 2, then 1.

2. **Iterative Approach Using Stack**:
   - Unlike preorder and inorder traversals, postorder is a bit trickier because the root is visited last.
   - We will use a stack to simulate the recursive call stack.
   - To handle the order correctly, we will keep track of the last node processed.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize an empty stack and start from the root.
   - Iterate until the stack is not empty:
     - Push all left children of the current node onto the stack.
     - Once we reach a leaf node, check if it has a right child or if the right child has been processed.
     - If it has a right child and it hasn't been processed, push the right child onto the stack.
     - If it doesn't have a right child or the right child has been processed, process the node and pop it from the stack.
   - This ensures that nodes are processed in the correct postorder sequence.

Original Question: Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a **[Least Recently Used (LRU) cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU)**.

Implement the `LRUCache` class:

*   `LRUCache(int capacity)` Initialize the LRU cache with **positive** size `capacity`.
*   `int get(int key)` Return the value of the `key` if the key exists, otherwise return `-1`.
*   `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the `key` if the `key` exists. Otherwise, add the `key-value` pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the `capacity` from this operation, **evict** the least recently used key.

The functions `get` and `put` must each run in `O(1)` average time complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "LRUCache ",  "put ",  "put ",  "get ",  "put ",  "get ",  "put ",  "get ",  "get ",  "get "\]
\[\[2\], \[1, 1\], \[2, 2\], \[1\], \[3, 3\], \[2\], \[4, 4\], \[1\], \[3\], \[4\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4\]

**Explanation**
LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}

lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}

*   `1 <= capacity <= 3000`
*   `0 <= key <= 104`
*   `0 <= value <= 105`

*   `0 <= value <= 105`
*   At most `2 * 105` calls will be made to `get` and `put`.
CoT: To implement an LRU cache in Python with O(1) time complexity for both get and put operations, we can use a combination of a dictionary and a doubly-linked list. The dictionary will provide fast access to the nodes, while the doubly-linked list will allow us to efficiently manage the order of recently used items.

### Approach

1. **Data Structures:**
   - **Dictionary:** To store the keys and their corresponding nodes for O(1) access.
   - **Doubly-Linked List:** To maintain the order of keys based on their usage. The most recently used key will be at the head, and the least recently used key will be at the tail.

2. **Node Class:**
   - Each node in the doubly-linked list will store the key and value, along with pointers to the previous and next nodes.

3. **LRUCache Class:**
   - **Initialization:** Set the capacity and initialize the dictionary, head, and tail of the linked list.
   - **get Operation:**
     - If the key is not present, return -1.
     - If the key is present, move the corresponding node to the head (to mark it as recently used) and return its value.
   - **put Operation:**
     - If the key is already present, update its value and move the node to the head.
     - If the key is not present, create a new node and add it to the head.
     - If the cache exceeds its capacity after adding the new node, remove the least recently used node (tail).

Original Question: Given the `head` of a singly linked list, sort the list using **insertion sort**, and return _the sorted list's head_.

The steps of the **insertion sort** algorithm:

1.  Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list.
2.  At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list and inserts it there.
3.  It repeats until no input elements remain.

The following is a graphical example of the insertion sort algorithm. The partially sorted list (black) initially contains only the first element in the list. One element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list with each iteration.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[4,2,1,3\]
**Output:** \[1,2,3,4\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[-1,5,3,4,0\]
**Output:** \[-1,0,3,4,5\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5000]`.
*   `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5000]`.
*   `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to implement the insertion sort algorithm on a singly linked list. Insertion sort works by iterating through the list, removing one element at a time, and inserting it into its correct position in a sorted sublist.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Create a dummy node to serve as the head of the sorted list. This simplifies edge cases where we need to insert nodes before the current head.
   
2. **Iteration**:
   - Maintain two pointers: one for the current node we're considering (`current`), and another for the sorted list (`sorted_head`).
   - For each node in the original list, find the correct position in the sorted list and insert it there.
   
3. **Insertion**:
   - Use a pointer (`prev`) to track the node just before the insertion point in the sorted list.
   - Adjust pointers to insert the current node into the sorted list.

4. **Termination**:
   - Continue this process until all nodes from the original list have been inserted into the sorted list.

CoT: To solve the problem of sorting a linked list in ascending order, we can use the merge sort algorithm, which is efficient and well-suited for linked lists. The merge sort algorithm divides the list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

### Approach

1. **Find the Middle:** 
   - Use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list.
   
2. **Divide the List:**
   - Split the list into two halves at the middle.
   
3. **Recursively Sort:**
   - Recursively sort the two halves.
   
4. **Merge the Sorted Lists:**
   - Merge the two sorted halves back into a single sorted list.

This approach ensures that the list is sorted in O(n log n) time complexity, which is efficient for large lists.

*   `points[i].length == 2`
*   `-104 <= xi, yi <= 104`
*   All the `points` are **unique**.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line from a given array of points on the X-Y plane. 

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of points that are collinear, i.e., they lie on the same straight line.
   - Given that all points are unique, we don't need to handle duplicate points.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - Three or more points are collinear if the slope between any two pairs of points is the same.
   - The slope between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \(\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\) (if \(x_2 \neq x_1\)), otherwise, it's vertical (infinite slope).

3. **Algorithm:**
   - For each point, calculate the slope with every other point and use a hash map to count the occurrences of each slope.
   - Keep track of the maximum count of points sharing the same slope with respect to the current point.
   - Iterate through all points and update the global maximum count.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - All points are the same (but given all points are unique).
   - All points lie on a vertical line.
   - All points lie on a horizontal line.
   - Points with both vertical and horizontal lines.
   - General scattered points with various slopes.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - Time Complexity: \(O(N^2)\) due to the nested loops for pairs of points.
   - Space Complexity: \(O(N)\) for the hash map storing slopes.

*   `tokens[i]` is either an operator: `"+ "`, `"- "`, `"* "`, or `"/ "`, or an integer in the range `[-200, 200]`.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to evaluate an arithmetic expression given in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). RPN is a way of writing expressions where the operators follow their operands. For example, the infix expression `(3 + 4) * 5` would be written in RPN as `3 4 + 5 *`.

### Approach

1. **Understand RPN Evaluation**:
   - In RPN, we process the expression from left to right.
   - When we encounter an operand, we push it onto a stack.
   - When we encounter an operator, we pop the top one or two operands from the stack, apply the operator, and push the result back onto the stack.

2. **Handle Operators**:
   - We need to handle four operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.
   - Division should truncate towards zero.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Ensure that there are enough operands before applying an operator.
   - Handle negative numbers and integers within the range `[-200, 200]`.

4. **Stack Usage**:
   - Use a stack to keep track of operands.
   - For each token:
     - If it's a number, push it onto the stack.
     - If it's an operator, pop the necessary operands, apply the operation, and push the result back.

**Explanation:** You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 104`
*   `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.
*   There is **at least one** word in `s`.

**Follow-up:** If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it **in-place** with `O(1)` extra space?
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of words in a given string `s`, while handling extra spaces appropriately. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

### Approach

1. **Trim the input string**: Remove leading and trailing spaces.
2. **Split the string into words**: Split the string by spaces, ensuring that multiple spaces are treated as a single separator.
3. **Reverse the list of words**: Reverse the list of words obtained from the split operation.
4. **Join the words with a single space**: Combine the reversed list of words into a single string with words separated by a single space.

### Solution Code
Response: python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Trim the input string and split into words
        words = s.strip().split()
        # Reverse the list of words
        reversed_words = words[::-1]
        # Join the reversed words with a single space
        return''.join(reversed_words)

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums`, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return _the product_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,-2,4\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** \[2,3\] has the largest product 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[-2,0,-1\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The result cannot be 2, because \[-2,-1\] is not a subarray.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
*   `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
*   The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

*   `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
*   The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the subarray within the given array `nums` that has the largest product. The key challenge here is handling the signs of the numbers, especially since negative numbers can turn a small product into a large one when multiplied together.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize three variables:
     - `result` to store the maximum product found so far. We set it to the first element of the array.
     - `currMin` to track the minimum product ending at the current position.
     - `currMax` to track the maximum product ending at the current position.
   - Both `currMin` and `currMax` are initially set to the first element.

2. **Iteration**:
   - We iterate through the array starting from the second element.
   - At each step, we consider the current number and decide whether to multiply it by the previous `currMax`, `currMin`, or take it as is.
   - This is because a negative number can turn a minimum product into a maximum one and vice versa.
   - We update `currMax` and `currMin` accordingly.

3. **Updating the Result**:
   - After updating `currMax` and `currMin`, we update `result` to be the maximum of itself and `currMax`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The array can contain zeros, which reset the product to zero.
   - The array can contain negative numbers, which require tracking both minimum and maximum products.

Original Question: Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

*   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
*   `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time.`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,4,5,1,2\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The original array was \[1,2,3,4,5\] rotated 3 times.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,6,7,0,1,2\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The original array was \[0,1,2,4,5,6,7\] and it was rotated 4 times.

**Example 3:**

**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** The original array was \[11,13,15,17\] and it was rotated 4 times. 

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 5000`
*   `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
*   All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum element in a sorted and rotated array efficiently, preferably in O(log n) time complexity. Given that the array is sorted and then rotated, we can leverage a modified binary search to achieve this.

### Approach

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - We have a sorted array that has been rotated an unknown number of times.
   - The array contains unique elements.
   - We need to find the minimum element in this array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - In a sorted and rotated array, there is a single point where the order changes. For example, in [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], the order changes from 7 to 0.
   - The minimum element is the one at the point where the array wraps around.

3. **Modified Binary Search**:
   - Use binary search to find the point where the array is no longer in order.
   - Compare the middle element with its previous and next elements to find the wrap-around point.
   - Adjust the search range based on the comparison between the middle element and the end element.

*   `[0,1,4,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` that may contain **duplicates**, return _the minimum element of this array_.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum element in a sorted and rotated array that may contain duplicates. The array is rotated between 1 and n times, where n is the length of the array.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The array is initially sorted in ascending order.
   - It is then rotated, meaning some elements from the end are moved to the start.
   - The rotation can happen multiple times, but since rotating n times brings the array back to its original state, the effective rotation is between 1 and n times.
   - The array may contain duplicates, which complicates the search for the minimum element.

2. **Key Insights:**
   - In a sorted and rotated array without duplicates, we can use binary search to find the minimum element efficiently.
   - Duplicates can make it difficult to decide which half of the array to discard during binary search, as the start, middle, and end elements might be equal.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - Use a binary search approach.
   - Compare the middle element with the end element to decide which half might contain the minimum.
   - If the middle element is greater than the end element, the minimum must be in the right half.
   - If the middle element is less than the end element, the minimum is in the left half.
   - If the middle element is equal to the end element, we cannot decide directly. In this case, decrement the end pointer to skip the duplicate.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Array with all elements the same.
   - Array with duplicates.
   - Array rotated n times (i.e., original sorted array).
   - Array with single element.

Implement the `MinStack` class:

*   `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
*   `void push(int val)` pushes the element `val` onto the stack.
*   `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.

You must implement a solution with `O(1)` time complexity for each function.

\[ "MinStack ", "push ", "push ", "push ", "getMin ", "pop ", "top ", "getMin "\]
\[\[\],\[-2\],\[0\],\[-3\],\[\],\[\],\[\],\[\]\]

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to turn a binary tree upside down according to the specified rules. Let's break down the problem and understand the steps required to achieve this transformation.

2. **Recursive Approach:**
   - We will use recursion to traverse the tree depth-first.
   - At each step, we perform the transformation on the current node and its children.
   - We need to handle the base cases where the node is `None` or a leaf node.

3. **Tracking Parent and Sibling Information:**
   - During the recursion, we need to keep track of the parent and sibling information to correctly rewire the tree.

Original Question: Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method to read `n` characters.

**Method read4:**

The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

File file( "abcde `"); // File is  "`abcde `", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  "abcd ", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  "e ", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  " ", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The `read` function will only be called once for each test case.
*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** file =  "abc ", n = 4
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abc ". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
Note that  "abc " is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** file =  "abcde ", n = 5
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abcde ". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** file =  "abcdABCD1234 ", n = 12
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abcdABCD1234 ". We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= file.length <= 500`
*   `file` consist of English letters and digits.
*   `1 <= n <= 1000`

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

File file( "abcde `"); // File is  "`abcde `", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  "abcd ", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  "e ", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  " ", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The `read` function will only be called once for each test case.
*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** file =  "abc ", n = 4
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abc ". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
Note that  "abc " is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** file =  "abcde ", n = 5
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abcde ". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** file =  "abcdABCD1234 ", n = 12
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abcdABCD1234 ". We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= file.length <= 500`
*   `file` consist of English letters and digits.
*   `1 <= n <= 1000`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to implement a method called `read` that reads `n` characters from a file using a given method `read4`. The `read4` method reads up to 4 characters at a time into a buffer array `buf4` and returns the number of characters actually read.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We need a buffer to hold the characters read from `read4`.
   - We also need to keep track of the characters read so far and the total number of characters read.

2. **Reading Characters**:
   - We will repeatedly call `read4` until we have read `n` characters or there are no more characters to read.
   - Each call to `read4` can read up to 4 characters, so we need to handle cases where `n` is not a multiple of 4.
   - We need to copy the characters read by `read4` into the destination buffer `buf`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is 0, we should return 0 immediately.
   - If the file has fewer characters than `n`, we should read all available characters and return the actual number read.
   - If `n` is larger than the file size, we should read the entire file and return the number of characters read.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

### Approach

1. **Internal Buffer:** Use an internal buffer to store characters read from the file using `read4`. This buffer will help in managing characters across multiple calls to `read`.

*   `s` consists of English letters.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring in a given string `s` that contains at most two distinct characters. We can use the sliding window technique to efficiently solve this problem.

### Approach

1. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - We maintain a window defined by two pointers, `left` and `right`, which represent the current substring we are considering.
   - We use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of characters within the current window.
   - We expand the window by moving the `right` pointer to the right, adding characters to the frequency dictionary.
   - If the number of distinct characters in the window exceeds two, we shrink the window from the left by moving the `left` pointer to the right until we have at most two distinct characters.

2. **Tracking Maximum Length**:
   - As we adjust the window, we keep track of the maximum length of the window that contains at most two distinct characters.

            char_frequency[s[right]] += 1
        else:
            char_frequency[s[right]] = 1
        
        # If there are more than two distinct characters, shrink the window from the left
        while len(char_frequency) > 2:
            char_frequency[s[left]] -= 1
            if char_frequency[s[left]] == 0:
                del char_frequency[s[left]]

Original Question: Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

*   `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
*   `listA` - The first linked list.
*   `listB` - The second linked list.
*   `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 8, listA = \[4,1,8,4,5\], listB = \[5,6,1,8,4,5\], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[4,1,8,4,5\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[5,6,1,8,4,5\]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 2, listA = \[1,9,1,2,4\], listB = \[3,2,4\], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
**Output:** Intersected at '2'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[1,9,1,2,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[3,2,4\]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = \[2,6,4\], listB = \[1,5\], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[2,6,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[1,5\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
*   The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
*   `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104`
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `0 <= skipA < m`
*   `0 <= skipB < n`
*   `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
*   `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that runs in `O(m + n)` time and use only `O(1)` memory?

*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 8, listA = \[4,1,8,4,5\], listB = \[5,6,1,8,4,5\], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[4,1,8,4,5\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[5,6,1,8,4,5\]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.

From the head of A, it reads as \[1,9,1,2,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[3,2,4\]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = \[2,6,4\], listB = \[1,5\], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[2,6,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[1,5\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
*   The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
*   `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104`
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `0 <= skipA < m`
*   `0 <= skipB < n`
*   `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
*   `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that runs in `O(m + n)` time and use only `O(1)` memory?
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the intersection point of two singly linked lists, if it exists. The challenge is to do this efficiently, preferably in linear time and constant space.

### Approach

1. **Calculate Lengths:** First, we need to determine the lengths of both linked lists. This will help us handle any difference in their lengths, ensuring that both pointers are at the same distance from the intersection point.

2. **Align Pointers:** We'll advance the pointer of the longer list by the difference in lengths. This way, both pointers will be at the same distance from the intersection point.

3. **Find Intersection:** Then, we move both pointers forward in tandem. The first node where the pointers meet is the intersection point. If no intersection exists, both pointers will reach the end simultaneously.

*   Delete **exactly one** character from `s` to get `t`.
*   Replace **exactly one** character of `s` with **a different character** to get `t`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "ab ", t =  "acb "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** We can insert 'c' into s to get t.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  " ", t =  " "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** We cannot get t from s by only one step.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length, t.length <= 104`
*   `s` and `t` consist of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits.
Attacked Question: Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if they are both one edit distance apart, otherwise return `false`.

A string `s` is said to be one distance apart from a string `t` if you can:

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length, t.length <= 104`
*   `s` and `t` consist of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if two strings, `s` and `t`, are exactly one edit distance apart. The edit operations allowed are insertion, deletion, or replacement of exactly one character.

### Approach

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `s` and `t` are equal, they are not one edit distance apart unless one is empty.
   - If the length difference between `s` and `t` is more than 1, they cannot be one edit distance apart.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - We will iterate through both strings simultaneously.
   - If we find a mismatch, we will handle it based on the lengths of the strings:
     - If `s` is longer than `t`, consider deleting one character from `s`.
     - If `t` is longer than `s`, consider inserting one character into `s` (which is equivalent to deleting one character from `t`).
     - If both strings are of the same length, consider replacing one character in `s` with the corresponding character in `t`.
   - After the operation, the remaining parts of the strings should match exactly.

3. **Helper Function**:
   - Use a helper function to check if the remaining parts of the strings match after the edit operation.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def isOneEditDistance(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    len_s = len(s)
    len_t = len(t)
    
    if len_s > len_t:

    if len_t - len_s > 1:
        # Length difference is more than 1
        return False
    
    for i in range(len_s):
        if s[i]!= t[i]:
            # If strings have the same length, check by replacing one character
            if len_s == len_t:
                return s[i+1:] == t[i+1:]
            # If t is longer than s, check by inserting one character into s
            else:
                return s[i:] == t[i+1:]
    
    # If all characters are the same, check if s is missing exactly one character at the end

Original Question: A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,1,3,5,6,4\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
*   `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.

*   `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find a peak element in an array where a peak element is defined as one that is greater than its neighbors. The array is visualized with imaginary negative infinity at both ends, meaning the first and last elements can be peaks if they are greater than their single neighbors.

### Approach

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array has only one element, that element is a peak.
   - If the first element is greater than the second, it is a peak.
   - If the last element is greater than the second last, it is a peak.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - Since the problem requires a O(log n) solution, binary search is suitable.
   - At each mid-point in the array, check if it is greater than both its neighbors.
   - If it is, return the index.
   - If it is not, decide to search the left or right half based on which neighbor is greater.
     - If the right neighbor is greater, there must be a peak in the right half.
     - If the left neighbor is greater, there must be a peak in the left half.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def findPeakElement(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

        mid = (left + right) // 2

            left = mid + 1
        else:

Original Question: You are given an inclusive range `[lower, upper]` and a **sorted unique** integer array `nums`, where all elements are in the inclusive range.

A number `x` is considered **missing** if `x` is in the range `[lower, upper]` and `x` is not in `nums`.

Return _the **smallest sorted** list of ranges that **cover every missing number exactly**_. That is, no element of `nums` is in any of the ranges, and each missing number is in one of the ranges.

Each range `[a,b]` in the list should be output as:

*   `"a->b "` if `a != b`
*   `"a "` if `a == b`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,3,50,75\], lower = 0, upper = 99
**Output:** \[ "2 ", "4->49 ", "51->74 ", "76->99 "\]
**Explanation:** The ranges are:
\[2,2\] -->  "2 "
\[4,49\] -->  "4->49 "
\[51,74\] -->  "51->74 "
\[76,99\] -->  "76->99 "

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to identify all the missing numbers in the given range [lower, upper] that are not present in the sorted unique integer array nums. We have to return these missing numbers as a list of ranges, formatted appropriately.

### Approach

1. **Initialize Pointers and Result List:**
   - We will iterate through the nums array and keep track of the current number and its position.
   - We will maintain a result list to store the formatted missing ranges.

2. **Handle Edge Cases:**
   - If nums is empty, the entire range [lower, upper] is missing.
   - If lower is missing before the first element in nums.
   - If upper is missing after the last element in nums.
   - If there are gaps between consecutive elements in nums.

3. **Iterate Through nums:**
   - For each element in nums, check if there is a gap between the current element and the previous one.
   - If there is a gap, format the missing range and add it to the result list.

4. **Format the Ranges:**
   - If the start and end of the range are the same, format it as a single number (e.g., "2").
   - If the start and end are different, format it as a range (e.g., "4->49").

5. **Edge Handling:**
   - Start from lower - 1 to handle the case where lower is missing.
   - End at upper + 1 to handle the case where upper is missing.

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums`, return _the maximum difference between two successive elements in its sorted form_. If the array contains less than two elements, return `0`.

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear time and uses linear extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,6,9,1\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The sorted form of the array is \[1,3,6,9\], either (3,6) or (6,9) has the maximum difference 3.

**Example 2:**

**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 109`

**Explanation:** The array contains less than 2 elements, therefore return 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 109`
CoT: To solve this problem with the constraints of linear time and space complexity, we need to be careful about the sorting method we use because traditional comparison-based sorting algorithms have a lower bound of O(n log n). Therefore, we need to use a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that can sort in linear time.

One such algorithm is radix sort, which sorts integers by processing individual digits. However, radix sort typically requires multiple passes based on the number of digits in the largest number, which could potentially exceed linear time in the worst case.

Another approach is to use bucket sort, which distributes elements into a number of buckets and then sorts each bucket individually. If we can distribute the elements uniformly across the buckets, we can ensure that the maximum gap is between the maximum of one bucket and the minimum of the next non-empty bucket.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Find the range of the array:** Determine the minimum and maximum values in the array.
2. **Calculate bucket sizes:** Determine the size of each bucket based on the desired maximum gap.
3. **Distribute elements into buckets:** Place each element into its corresponding bucket based on its value.
4. **Find the maximum gap:** Iterate through the buckets and find the largest gap between the maximum of one bucket and the minimum of the next non-empty bucket.

To ensure linear time complexity, we need to make sure that the number of buckets and the operations within each bucket are managed efficiently.

Let's proceed to implement this approach in Python.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem in linear time and space, we need to find the maximum difference between two successive elements in the sorted form of the array. Given the constraints, we cannot use traditional sorting algorithms directly because they typically have a time complexity of O(n log n). Instead, we will use a bucket sort approach, which allows us to achieve linear time complexity under certain conditions.

### Approach

1. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - If the array has less than two elements, return 0 immediately since no difference can be computed.

2. **Finding Minimum and Maximum**:
   - Determine the minimum and maximum values in the array to understand the range of values.

3. **Bucket Size Calculation**:
   - Calculate the intended bucket size. This is determined by dividing the range (max - min) by the number of elements minus one to maximize the potential gap.

4. **Bucket Initialization**:
   - Create buckets that can hold the minimum and maximum values. Each bucket will track the smallest and largest values assigned to it.

5. **Distribute Elements into Buckets**:
   - Distribute the elements of the array into the appropriate buckets based on their value.

6. **Calculate Maximum Gap**:
   - Iterate through the buckets to find the largest gap between the largest value of the current bucket and the smallest value of the next non-empty bucket.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def maximumGap(nums):
    if len(nums) < 2:
        return 0
    
    # Find the minimum and maximum values in the array

Original Question: Given two version numbers, `version1` and `version2`, compare them.

Version numbers consist of **one or more revisions** joined by a dot `'.'`. Each revision consists of **digits** and may contain leading **zeros**. Every revision contains **at least one character**. Revisions are **0-indexed from left to right**, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example `2.5.33` and `0.1` are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in **left-to-right order**. Revisions are compared using their **integer value ignoring any leading zeros**. This means that revisions `1` and `001` are considered **equal**. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then **treat the revision as `0`**. For example, version `1.0` is less than version `1.1` because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are `0` and `1` respectively, and `0 < 1`.

_Return the following:_

*   If `version1 < version2`, return `-1`.
*   If `version1 > version2`, return `1`.
*   Otherwise, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** version1 =  "1.01 ", version2 =  "1.001 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** Ignoring leading zeroes, both  "01 " and  "001 " represent the same integer  "1 ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** version1 =  "1.0 ", version2 =  "1.0.0 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** version1 does not specify revision 2, which means it is treated as  "0 ".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** version1 =  "0.1 ", version2 =  "1.1 "
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** version1's revision 0 is  "0 ", while version2's revision 0 is  "1 ". 0 < 1, so version1 < version2.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= version1.length, version2.length <= 500`
*   `version1` and `version2` only contain digits and `'.'`.
*   `version1` and `version2` **are valid version numbers**.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to compare two version numbers represented as strings. Version numbers are composed of revisions separated by dots, and each revision may contain leading zeros. The comparison should be done by comparing the integer values of the revisions from left to right.

### Approach

1. **Split the Version Strings:** 
   - Split both `version1` and `version2` by the dot character (`.`) to get lists of revisions.
   
2. **Normalize the Revision Lists:**
   - Convert each revision to an integer, ignoring leading zeros.
   - Determine the maximum length of the two revision lists.
   - Pad the shorter list with zeros to match the length of the longer list.

3. **Compare Revisions:**
   - Iterate through the revisions from left to right.
   - Compare the integer values of corresponding revisions.
   - If a revision in `version1` is greater than the corresponding revision in `version2`, return 1.
   - If a revision in `version1` is less than the corresponding revision in `version2`, return -1.
   - If all revisions are equal, return 0.

Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return _the indices of the two numbers,_ `index1` _and_ `index2`_, **added by one** as an integer array_ `[index1, index2]` _of length 2._

The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may not** use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** numbers = \[2,7,11,15\], target = 9
**Output:** \[1,2\]
**Explanation:** The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return \[1, 2\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** numbers = \[2,3,4\], target = 6
**Output:** \[1,3\]
**Explanation:** The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return \[1, 3\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** numbers = \[\-1,0\], target = -1
**Output:** \[1,2\]
**Explanation:** The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return \[1, 2\].

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
*   `numbers` is sorted in **non-decreasing order**.
*   `-1000 <= target <= 1000`

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a specific target. The array is 1-indexed, and we need to return the indices of these two numbers, added by one, as an integer array of length 2.

### Approach

Given that the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, we can use the two-pointer technique to efficiently find the two numbers that add up to the target.

1. **Initialize two pointers**:
   - One pointer starts at the beginning of the array (`left = 0`).
   - The other pointer starts at the end of the array (`right = len(numbers) - 1`).

2. **Iterate until the pointers meet**:
   - Calculate the sum of the elements at the current positions of the two pointers.
   - If the sum is equal to the target, return the 1-based indices of these two elements.
   - If the sum is less than the target, move the left pointer to the right (to increase the sum).
   - If the sum is greater than the target, move the right pointer to the left (to decrease the sum).

3. **Ensure constant extra space**:
   - We only use a constant amount of extra space for the pointers and variables, satisfying the problem's constraints.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def twoSum(numbers, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(numbers) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            # Convert to 1-based indexing
            return [left + 1, right + 1]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1

# Example usage:
# numbers = [2,7,11,15]
# target = 9
# print(twoSum(numbers, target))  # Output: [1, 2]

...

**Example 1:**

**Input:** columnNumber = 1

**Output:**  "AB "

**Example 3:**

**Input:** columnNumber = 701
**Output:**  "ZY "

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= columnNumber <= 231 - 1`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to convert an integer `columnNumber` into its corresponding Excel column title. Excel columns are labeled starting from "A" for 1, "B" for 2,..., "Z" for 26, and then "AA" for 27, "AB" for 28, and so on.

### Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:** This is similar to converting a decimal number to a base-26 numeral system, but with a few twists. In base-26, each position represents a power of 26, and each digit can be a letter from 'A' to 'Z'.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The letters 'A' to 'Z' correspond to the numbers 1 to 26.
   - After 'Z' (26), the next number is 'AA' (27), which is like a carry-over in base-26.
   - Unlike standard base conversion, there is no '0' in this system, as the lowest digit is 'A' (1).

3. **Algorithm:**
   - Initialize an empty string to build the column title.
   - While the columnNumber is greater than 0:
     - Subtract 1 from the columnNumber to adjust for the 1-based indexing ('A' to 'Z' correspond to 1 to 26, not 0 to 25).
     - Take the remainder of the columnNumber divided by 26.
     - If the remainder is 0, it corresponds to 'Z'. Since there is no '0', we set it to 'Z' and adjust the columnNumber for the next iteration.
     - Otherwise, the remainder corresponds to the letter directly ('A' for 1, 'B' for 2, etc.).
     - Append the corresponding letter to the front of the result string.
     - Update columnNumber by integer division by 26.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When columnNumber is 1, it should return "A".
   - When columnNumber is 28, it should return "AB".
   - When columnNumber is 701, it should return "ZY".

### Solution Code
Response: python
def convertToTitle(columnNumber: int) -> str:
    result = ""
    while columnNumber > 0:
        columnNumber -= 1  # Adjust for 1-based indexing
        remainder = columnNumber % 26
        result = chr(65 + remainder) + result  # ASCII value of 'A' is 65
        columnNumber //= 26

Original Question: Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return _the majority element_.

*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

**Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the majority element in an array, which is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times, where n is the size of the array. We are guaranteed that the majority element always exists in the array.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find an element that appears more than half the time in the array.
   - The constraint of linear time and O(1) space suggests we need an efficient algorithm.

2. **Using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm:**
   - This algorithm is efficient for finding the majority element.
   - It works by maintaining a candidate for the majority element and a counter initialized to 0.
   - As we iterate through the array:
     - If the counter is 0, we set the current element as the candidate.
     - If the current element is the same as the candidate, we increment the counter.
     - Otherwise, we decrement the counter.
   - At the end of the iteration, the candidate will be the majority element.

3. **Verification:**
   - Since the problem states that the majority element always exists, we don't need to verify it again.
   - However, in general, we might need to count the occurrences of the candidate to ensure it appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def majorityElement(nums):
    count = 0
    candidate = None

    for num in nums:
        if count == 0:
            candidate = num
        count += (num == candidate) - (num!= candidate)

Original Question: Design a data structure that accepts a stream of integers and checks if it has a pair of integers that sum up to a particular value.

Implement the `TwoSum` class:

*   `TwoSum()` Initializes the `TwoSum` object, with an empty array initially.
*   `void add(int number)` Adds `number` to the data structure.
*   `boolean find(int value)` Returns `true` if there exists any pair of numbers whose sum is equal to `value`, otherwise, it returns `false`.

**Example 1:**

### Approach

1. **Data Structure Selection**:
   - We will use a dictionary (hash map) to store the integers and their frequencies. This allows us to check for the existence of a required complement efficiently.

2. **Adding Numbers**:
   - When adding a number, we simply update its count in the dictionary.

3. **Finding Pairs**:
   - For a given value, we iterate through the dictionary and check if the complement (value - current number) exists.
   - We need to handle the case where the complement is the same as the number itself carefully, ensuring that there are at least two instances of that number.

*   `columnTitle` consists only of uppercase English letters.
*   `columnTitle` is in the range `[ "A ", "FXSHRXW "]`.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to convert an Excel column title, such as "A", "B", "C",..., "Z", "AA", "AB", etc., into its corresponding column number. For example, "A" corresponds to 1, "B" to 2,..., "Z" to 26, "AA" to 27, and so on.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Excel column titles use a base-26 numbering system, but with a slight difference: there is no zero, and the letters A to Z represent 1 to 26 respectively.
   - Similar to how binary is base-2 and decimal is base-10, this system is base-26, where each position represents a power of 26.

2. **Conversion Logic:**
   - Each character in the column title represents a digit in base-26.
   - The rightmost character is the least significant digit (similar to units place in decimal).
   - To find the column number, we need to calculate the value of each character and sum them up, taking into account their positions.

3. **Steps to Implement:**
   - Iterate through each character in the column title from left to right.
   - For each character, calculate its numerical value (A=1, B=2,..., Z=26).
   - Multiply this value by 26 raised to the power of the position index (starting from 0 on the left).
   - Sum all these values to get the final column number.

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that works in logarithmic time complexity?
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a given integer `n`. Trailing zeros are created by factors of 10 in the product, and since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, we need to count the number of times 2 and 5 are factors in the numbers from 1 to `n`. However, there are generally more factors of 2 than 5, so the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Approach

1. **Count Factors of 5**: To find the number of trailing zeros in `n!`, we count how many times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. **Iterative Division**: We can count the number of multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., because each multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5, multiples of 25 contribute an extra factor, and so on.
3. **Sum the Quotients**: The total count is the sum of `n` divided by 5, `n` divided by 25, `n` divided by 125, and so forth, until `n` divided by `5^k` is zero.

Original Question: Implement the `BSTIterator` class that represents an iterator over the **[in-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#In-order_(LNR))** of a binary search tree (BST):

*   `BSTIterator(TreeNode root)` Initializes an object of the `BSTIterator` class. The `root` of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.
*   `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns `false`.
*   `int next()` Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the pointer.

Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to `next()` will return the smallest element in the BST.

You may assume that `next()` calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next number in the in-order traversal when `next()` is called.

**Example 1:**

**Input**

Attacked Question: Implement the `BSTIterator` class that represents an iterator over the **[in-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#In-order_(LNR))** of a binary search tree (BST):

*   `BSTIterator(TreeNode root)` Initializes an object of the `BSTIterator` class. The `root` of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.
*   `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns `false`.
*   `int next()` Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the pointer.

Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to `next()` will return the smallest element in the BST.

You may assume that `next()` calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next number in the in-order traversal when `next()` is called.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "BSTIterator ",  "next ",  "next ",  "hasNext ",  "next ",  "hasNext ",  "next ",  "hasNext ",  "next ",  "hasNext "\]
\[\[\[7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20\]\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, 3, 7, true, 9, true, 15, true, 20, false\]

**Explanation**
BSTIterator bSTIterator = new BSTIterator(\[7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20\]);
bSTIterator.next();    // return 3
bSTIterator.next();    // return 7
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True
bSTIterator.next();    // return 9
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True
bSTIterator.next();    // return 15
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True
bSTIterator.next();    // return 20
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return False

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 105]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 106`
*   At most `105` calls will be made to `hasNext`, and `next`.

**Follow up:**

*   Could you implement `next()` and `hasNext()` to run in average `O(1)` time and use `O(h)` memory, where `h` is the height of the tree?
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to implement an iterator for a Binary Search Tree (BST) that can efficiently retrieve the next smallest element in the in-order traversal sequence and check if there are more elements to iterate over.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We will use a stack to keep track of the nodes in the BST.
   - Start by pushing all the left nodes from the root to the leftmost leaf into the stack. This ensures that the smallest element is always at the top of the stack.

2. **Next**:
   - The next smallest element is always the node at the top of the stack.
   - After popping the smallest node, we need to push its right subtree's left nodes into the stack to maintain the order.

3. **Has Next**:
   - Simply check if the stack is empty. If it's not empty, there are more elements to iterate over.

Original Question: The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in **the bottom-right corner** of a `dungeon`. The `dungeon` consists of `m x n` rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in **the top-left room** and must fight his way through `dungeon` to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to `0` or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).

To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only **rightward** or **downward** in each step.

Return _the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess_.

**Note** that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** dungeon = \[\[-2,-3,3\],\[-5,-10,1\],\[10,30,-5\]\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** The initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path: RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** dungeon = \[\[0\]\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `m == dungeon.length`
*   `n == dungeon[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `-1000 <= dungeon[i][j] <= 1000`

*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `-1000 <= dungeon[i][j] <= 1000`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum initial health required for the knight to reach the princess in the bottom-right corner of the dungeon grid, moving only rightward or downward at each step. The knight can lose health when entering rooms with negative integers and gain health when entering rooms with positive integers.

### Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Table Initialization**:
   - We will use a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum health required to reach the princess from cell `(i, j)`.
   - Initialize the DP table with dimensions `(m+1) x (n+1)`, where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the dungeon grid. The extra row and column are for boundary conditions.

2. **Base Case**:
   - The base case is `dp[m-1][n-1]`, which is the health required to handle the last cell. If the dungeon's last cell has a positive value, the knight needs at least 1 health to stay alive, so `dp[m-1][n-1] = max(1, 1 - dungeon[m-1][n-1])`. If the value is negative, the knight needs enough health to counteract the negative value.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - Fill the DP table from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner.
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, calculate the minimum health required to move to the next cell (either right or down).
   - The health required at `(i, j)` is the maximum of 1 and the difference between the minimum health required in the next step and the current cell's value.

4. **Result**:
   - The value in `dp[0][0]` will be the minimum initial health required to start from the top-left cell and reach the princess.

**Constraints:**

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to arrange a list of non-negative integers in such a way that they form the largest possible number when concatenated together. The challenge lies in determining the optimal order for these numbers, which isn't simply achieved by sorting them in descending order.

### Approach

1. **Convert integers to strings**: Since we need to concatenate the numbers as strings, it's helpful to convert the integers to strings early on.
2. **Custom comparison function**: We need a way to compare two numbers to decide which one should come first in the final arrangement. For example, given '3' and '30', '330' is larger than '303'. Therefore, '3' should come before '30'.
3. **Sorting**: Use the custom comparison function to sort the numbers.
4. **Edge case - leading zeros**: If the largest number starts with '0', the entire number is zero. Hence, we need to handle this case to return '0' instead of a string of zeros.

rotate 3 steps to the right: \[5,6,7,1,2,3,4\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[-1,-100,3,99\], k = 2
**Output:** \[3,99,-1,-100\]
**Explanation:** 
rotate 1 steps to the right: \[99,-1,-100,3\]
rotate 2 steps to the right: \[3,99,-1,-100\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
*   `0 <= k <= 105`

**Follow up:**

*   Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least **three** different ways to solve this problem.
*   Could you do it in-place with `O(1)` extra space?
CoT: To solve the problem of rotating an array to the right by `k` steps, we need to efficiently shift the elements of the array. The goal is to perform this operation with optimal time and space complexity.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `nums` and a non-negative integer `k`.
   - We need to rotate the array to the right by `k` steps.
   - The rotation should be in-place if possible.

2. **Key Insights:**
   - Rotating the array by `k` steps is equivalent to moving the last `k` elements to the front.
   - If `k` is larger than the length of the array, we can reduce `k` modulo the length of the array since rotating by the length of the array brings it back to the original position.
   - We need to handle cases where `k` is zero or equal to the length of the array, which should leave the array unchanged.

3. **Efficient Solution:**
   - One efficient way to rotate the array is to reverse parts of the array.
   - First, normalize `k` by taking `k %= len(nums)` to handle cases where `k` is larger than the array length.
   - Reverse the entire array.
   - Reverse the first `k` elements.
   - Reverse the remaining `len(nums) - k` elements.

4. **Complexity Analysis:**
   - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array, since reversing is O(n).
   - Space Complexity: O(1), as we are performing operations in-place.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def rotate(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    if n == 0 or k % n == 0:
        return  # No rotation needed
    
    k %= n  # Normalize k
    reverse(nums, 0, n - 1)  # Reverse the entire array
    reverse(nums, 0, k - 1)  # Reverse the first k elements
    reverse(nums, k, n - 1)  # Reverse the remaining elements

def reverse(nums, start, end):
    while start < end:
        nums[start], nums[end] = nums[end], nums[start]
        start += 1
        end -= 1

**Note:**

*   Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
*   In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 2** above, the input represents the signed integer `-3` and the output represents the signed integer `-1073741825`.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to reverse the bits of a given 32-bit unsigned integer. The key points to consider are:

1. We are dealing with a 32-bit integer, so we need to ensure that we handle all 32 bits, including leading zeros.
2. The integer is unsigned, but in languages like Python, integers can be of arbitrary size, so we need to treat it as a 32-bit value.
3. We need to reverse the bits, which means that the least significant bit (LSB) becomes the most significant bit (MSB), and so on.

### Approach

1. **Convert the Integer to Binary:** Convert the given integer to its 32-bit binary representation.
2. **Reverse the Binary String:** Reverse the binary string.
3. **Convert Back to Integer:** Convert the reversed binary string back to an integer.

Original Question: You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,7,9,3,1\]
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to maximize the amount of money we can rob from houses arranged in a straight line, with the constraint that we cannot rob two adjacent houses. This is a classic dynamic programming problem where we make decisions based on previous choices.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We'll use two variables, `prev` and `curr`, to keep track of the maximum amount robbed up to the previous house and the current house, respectively.
   
2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For each house, we have two choices:
     - Rob the current house: In this case, we cannot rob the previous house, so the maximum amount is the sum of the current house's money and the maximum amount from two houses before.
     - Skip the current house: The maximum amount remains the same as the maximum amount from the previous house.
   - Therefore, for each house `i`, `curr = max(prev + nums[i], curr)`.

3. **Iteration**:
   - We iterate through the array of houses, updating `prev` and `curr` accordingly.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The maximum amount that can be robbed is stored in `curr` after processing all houses.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def rob(nums):
    prev = 0
    curr = 0
    for num in nums:
        temp = curr
        curr = max(prev + num, curr)

### Approach

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - We can use a BFS traversal to visit each level of the tree from left to right.
   - By keeping track of the nodes at each level, we can easily pick the rightmost node of each level.

2. **Level Order Traversal:**

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to count the number of islands in a given 2D grid where '1's represent land and '0's represent water. Islands are formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.

### Approach

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to traverse the grid and count the number of connected components of '1's.
   - Each connected component represents an island.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - We will use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore each island.
   - Traverse each cell in the grid:
     - If the cell is '1', it's the start of a new island.
     - Perform DFS from this cell to mark all connected '1's as visited.
     - Increment the island count.

3. **DFS Implementation**:
   - Change the '1's to a different character (e.g., '2') to mark them as visited.
   - Recursively visit all four possible directions (up, down, left, right).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Single cell grid.
   - All cells are '0'.
   - All cells are '1'.

**Input:** left = 1, right = 2147483647
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= left <= right <= 231 - 1`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the bitwise AND of all numbers in the range `[left, right]`, inclusive. At first glance, one might think of iterating through each number in the range and applying the bitwise AND operation逐个地. However, this approach would be inefficient for large ranges, such as when `right` is close to 2^31 - 1, because it would require iterating through up to 2^31 elements, which is computationally infeasible.

Therefore, we need a smarter way to compute the bitwise AND of the range without iterating through each number.

### Approach

The key insight here is to recognize that the bitwise AND of a range of numbers will tend to zero as the range increases because differing bits will eventually cause those bits to be zero in the AND operation.

However, there's a more efficient way to compute this by finding the common leftmost bits of `left` and `right`. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Find the common prefix in the binary representation of `left` and `right`**:
   - As we perform bitwise AND across a range, the bits that differ between `left` and `right` will eventually become zero.
   - The common prefix is the part of the binary representation that is the same for both `left` and `right`.

2. **Shift both `left` and `right` to the right until they are equal**:
   - This helps in identifying the common prefix.
   - Count the number of shifts performed.

3. **Shift the common prefix back to the left by the number of shifts counted**:
   - This will give us the bitwise AND of the entire range.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def rangeBitwiseAnd(left: int, right: int) -> int:
    shift = 0
    # Find the common prefix
    while left < right:
        left >>= 1
        right >>= 1
        shift += 1
    # Shift back the common prefix
    return left << shift

Original Question: Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:

*   Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
*   Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1.
*   Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy.

Return `true` _if_ `n` _is a happy number, and_ `false` _if not_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 19
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number `n` is a happy number. A happy number is defined by a process where we repeatedly replace the number with the sum of the squares of its digits and check if it eventually reaches 1.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Process**:
   - For a given number, calculate the sum of the squares of its digits.
   - Repeat this process with the new number.
   - If this process reaches 1, the number is happy.
   - If it enters a cycle that does not include 1, it is not happy.

2. **Detecting Cycles**:
   - We need a way to detect if we're stuck in a cycle.
   - Using a set to track numbers we've already seen can help identify cycles.

3. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - While `n` is not 1 and we haven't seen `n` before:
     - Add `n` to the seen set.
     - Calculate the next number by summing the squares of the digits of `n`.
     - Set `n` to this new number.
   - If `n` becomes 1, return `True`.
   - If we detect a cycle (i.e., `n` is already in the seen set), return `False`.

### Solution Code

def isHappy(n):
    seen = set()
    while n!= 1 and n not in seen:
        seen.add(n)
        n = sum(int(char)**2 for char in str(n))

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if two strings, `s` and `t`, are isomorphic. This means that we can replace characters in `s` with characters in `t` in a one-to-one mapping fashion, preserving the order of characters, and no two characters in `s` map to the same character in `t`, unless they are the same character.

### Approach

1. **Character Mapping**: We need to map each character in `s` to its corresponding character in `t`. This mapping must be consistent throughout the strings.
2. **Unique Mapping**: Ensure that no two different characters in `s` map to the same character in `t`.
3. **Length Check**: Since the strings must be of the same length to be isomorphic, we first check if their lengths are equal.

CoT: To solve the problem of reversing a singly linked list, we can use both iterative and recursive approaches. I'll provide solutions for both methods.

### Approach 1: Iterative Method

In the iterative approach, we use three pointers: `prev`, `current`, and `next`. We start with `prev` as `None`, and `current` as the `head` of the list. We iterate through the list, reversing the links between the nodes step by step.

*   `void insert(String word)` Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
*   `boolean search(String word)` Returns `true` if the string `word` is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and `false` otherwise.

   - Each node will also have a boolean flag to indicate whether a word ends at that node.

2. **Insert Operation**:
   - Start from the root node.
   - For each character in the word, check if it exists in the current node's children.
     - If it does, move to that child node.
     - If it doesn't, create a new node for that character and add it to the children, then move to the new node.
   - After processing all characters, mark the last node as the end of a word.

3. **Search Operation**:
   - Start from the root node.
   - For each character in the word, check if it exists in the current node's children.
     - If it does, move to that child node.
     - If it doesn't, the word is not in the Trie.
   - After processing all characters, check if the last node is marked as the end of a word.

4. **Starts With Operation**:
   - Similar to the search operation, but instead of checking if the last node is the end of a word, we just need to check if all characters in the prefix exist in the Trie.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest subarray in a given array of positive integers whose sum is greater than or equal to a specified target value. If no such subarray exists, we should return 0.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window of the subarray.
   - We also keep track of the current sum of the elements in the window and the minimum length of such a window found so far.

2. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - We use a sliding window approach to efficiently find the minimal subarray length.
   - We start with both `left` and `right` at the beginning of the array and expand the window to the right, adding elements to the current sum.
   - When the current sum becomes greater than or equal to the target, we record the length of the current window and try to shrink the window from the left to find an even smaller subarray that meets the condition.
   - We repeat this process until the right pointer reaches the end of the array.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the sum of the entire array is less than the target, we return 0 since no such subarray exists.
   - If the array contains only one element, we check if that element is greater than or equal to the target.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def minSubArrayLen(target, nums):
    n = len(nums)
    min_length = float('inf')
    left = 0
    current_sum = 0
    
    for right in range(n):
        current_sum += nums[right]
        while current_sum >= target:
            min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)
            current_sum -= nums[left]
            left += 1
    return min_length if min_length!= float('inf') else 0

*   For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return _the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses_. If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = \[\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** \[0,1\]
**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is \[0,1\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** numCourses = 4, prerequisites = \[\[1,0\],\[2,0\],\[3,1\],\[3,2\]\]
**Output:** \[0,2,1,3\]
**Explanation:** There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.

*   `ai != bi`
*   All the pairs `[ai, bi]` are **distinct**.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find a valid order in which to take the courses, respecting the prerequisites. This is essentially finding a topological order of a directed graph where nodes are courses and edges represent prerequisites.

### Approach

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - We represent the courses and their prerequisites as a directed graph.
   - Each course is a node, and a directed edge from course `b` to course `a` indicates that `b` is a prerequisite for `a`.

2. **Topological Sorting:**
   - Topological sorting is used to linearly order the courses such that for every directed edge from `b` to `a`, course `b` comes before course `a` in the ordering.
   - We can use Kahn's algorithm, which is based on BFS and uses indegrees of nodes.

3. **Steps:**
   - Calculate the indegree (number of incoming edges) for each course.
   - Use a queue to keep track of courses with indegree zero (no prerequisites).
   - Start with courses that have no prerequisites, add them to the result, and reduce the indegree of their neighboring courses.
   - Continue this process until the queue is empty.
   - If all courses are visited, return the order; otherwise, return an empty array if a cycle is detected (i.e., some courses cannot be taken due to circular dependencies).

    # Step 2: Initialize queue with courses having indegree 0

Original Question: Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding if a string matches any previously added string.

Implement the `WordDictionary` class:

*   `WordDictionary()` Initializes the object.
*   `void addWord(word)` Adds `word` to the data structure, it can be matched later.
*   `bool search(word)` Returns `true` if there is any string in the data structure that matches `word` or `false` otherwise. `word` may contain dots `'.'` where dots can be matched with any letter.

**Example:**

**Input**
\[ "WordDictionary ", "addWord ", "addWord ", "addWord ", "search ", "search ", "search ", "search "\]
\[\[\],\[ "bad "\],\[ "dad "\],\[ "mad "\],\[ "pad "\],\[ "bad "\],\[ ".ad "\],\[ "b.. "\]\]
**Output**
\[null,null,null,null,false,true,true,true\]

**Explanation**
WordDictionary wordDictionary = new WordDictionary();
wordDictionary.addWord( "bad ");
wordDictionary.addWord( "dad ");
wordDictionary.addWord( "mad ");
wordDictionary.search( "pad "); // return False
wordDictionary.search( "bad "); // return True
wordDictionary.search( ".ad "); // return True
wordDictionary.search( "b.. "); // return True

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a Trie (prefix tree) data structure, which is efficient for storing and searching strings. In this case, we need to handle wildcards represented by dots ('.'), which can match any single character.

### Approach

1. **Trie Node Structure:**
   - Each node in the Trie will have a dictionary to store its children nodes, where the keys are characters and the values are the child nodes.
   - Each node will have a boolean flag to indicate if it marks the end of a word.

2. **Adding a Word:**
   - Start from the root node.
   - For each character in the word, if the character is not in the current node's children, create a new node for it.
   - Move to the child node corresponding to the current character.
   - Mark the last node as the end of a word.

3. **Searching for a Word:**
   - Start from the root node.
   - If the character is a '.', it can match any single character, so we need to check all possible children nodes at this level.
   - If the character is a regular character, check if it exists in the current node's children.
   - Recursively search through the Trie for each character in the word.
   - If the entire word is traversed and the final node is marked as the end of a word, return True; otherwise, return False.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[ "o ", "a ", "a ", "n "\],\[ "e ", "t ", "a ", "e "\],\[ "i ", "h ", "k ", "r "\],\[ "i ", "f ", "l ", "v "\]\], words = \[ "oath ", "pea ", "eat ", "rain "\]

*   All the strings of `words` are unique.
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a combination of backtracking and trie data structure. The idea is to build a trie from the list of words and then perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the board for each cell, checking if the path forms a valid word in the trie.

## Approach

1. **Trie Data Structure**:
   - We'll create a trie where each node represents a character in the word.
   - Each node will have a dictionary to store its children characters and a flag to indicate the end of a word.

2. **Building the Trie**:
   - Insert each word from the list into the trie.
   - Mark the end of each word in the trie.

3. **DFS on the Board**:
   - For each cell in the board, start a DFS to explore all possible paths.
   - During DFS, check if the current path forms a prefix in the trie.
   - If a complete word is found, add it to the result list.
   - Ensure that each cell is not reused in the same path by marking it as visited.

4. **Optimizations**:
   - Prune the trie by removing words that have already been found to avoid redundant searches.
   - Use a set to store the found words for quick lookups.

Original Question: You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
Attacked Question: You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
CoT: I've got this problem where I'm a robber planning to hit houses along a street, but the houses are arranged in a circle, meaning the first and last houses are neighbors. I need to maximize the amount of money I rob without triggering the security system, which goes off if I rob two adjacent houses on the same night.

So, the key points here are:

1. Houses are in a circle: the first and last houses are adjacent.

2. Can't rob two adjacent houses.

3. Need to maximize the total money robbed.

I recall that for houses in a line, this is a classic dynamic programming problem. For a linear arrangement, the standard approach is to use DP where `dp[i]` represents the maximum amount you can rob up to the `i`-th house.

The recurrence relation for a linear arrangement is:

`dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])`

- `dp[i-1]`: skip the current house.

- `dp[i-2] + nums[i]`: rob the current house and add its value to the amount from two houses back.

But here, since the houses are in a circle, robbing the first house affects whether I can rob the last house, and vice versa.

So, I need to handle the circular dependency.

One way to approach this is to consider two separate cases:

1. Rob the first house (and hence, cannot rob the last house).

2. Do not rob the first house (and hence, can consider robbing the last house).

Then, take the maximum of these two scenarios.

Wait, but actually, in the first case, if I rob the first house, I cannot rob the last house. In the second case, if I don't rob the first house, I can rob the last house if it's beneficial.

So, I can split the problem into two subproblems:

- Case 1: Rob houses from the first to the second-to-last house (indices 0 to n-2).

- Case 2: Rob houses from the second to the last house (indices 1 to n-1).

Then, compute the maximum for each case using the standard linear DP approach, and finally take the maximum of these two cases.

Let me think about why this works.

In Case 1, by excluding the last house, I ensure that robbing the first house doesn't conflict with robbing the last house since the last house isn't considered.

In Case 2, by excluding the first house, I can safely consider robbing the last house.

By taking the maximum of these two cases, I cover all possible scenarios without violating the adjacency constraint.

Let me test this logic with the sample inputs.

**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [2,3,2]

- Case 1: Rob houses 0 and 1 only: [2,3]. Using linear DP: max(2, 3) = 3.

- Case 2: Rob houses 1 and 2: [3,2]. Using linear DP: max(3, 2) = 3.

- Overall maximum: 3.

Which matches the expected output.

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]

- Case 1: Rob houses 0,1,2: [1,2,3]. Using linear DP: 1 + 3 = 4.

- Case 2: Rob houses 1,2,3: [2,3,1]. Using linear DP: 2 + 1 = 3.

- Overall maximum: 4.

Which matches the expected output.

**Example 3:**

Input: nums = [1,2,3]

- Case 1: Rob houses 0 and 1: [1,2]. Using linear DP: 1 + 2 = 3.

- Case 2: Rob houses 1 and 2: [2,3]. Using linear DP: 2 + 3 = 5.

Wait, but in this case, since houses are in a circle, robbing house 1 and house 2 would make house 0 (which is adjacent to house 2) off-limits, but in Case 2, we're not considering house 0 at all. So, in Case 2, robbing house 1 and house 2 is allowed because house 0 is not being considered.

But according to the problem, house 0 and house 2 are neighbors, so if I rob house 2, I cannot rob house 0. But in Case 2, house 0 is not being considered, so it's fine to rob house 2.

However, in this specific example, the overall maximum would be 3 from Case 1 (rob house 0 and house 2, but since house 0 and house 2 are neighbors, I can't rob both. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach needs refinement.

Let me try to think differently.

Alternative approach:

- Consider all houses except the last one (houses 0 to n-2).

- Consider all houses except the first one (houses 1 to n-1).

- Compute the maximum for each scenario using the linear DP approach.

- Return the maximum of these two scenarios.

But in the third example:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]

- Case 1: houses 0 and 1: [1,2] → max(1, 2, 1+0, 2) = 3

- Case 2: houses 1 and 2: [2,3] → max(2, 3, 2+0, 3) = 3

- Overall maximum: 3

Which matches the expected output.

Wait, in my earlier thought process, I mistakenly considered robbing house 0 and house 2 in Case 1, but in Case 1, I'm only considering houses 0 and 1.

So, in Case 1: houses 0 and 1: [1,2] → can rob house 0 or house 1, not both, since they are adjacent.

- So, maximum is max(1, 2) = 2.

Wait, but in the earlier step, I thought it was 3, which was incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to apply the linear DP correctly.

For Case 1: houses 0 to n-2 = [1,2]

DP array:

- dp[0] = 1

- dp[1] = max(dp[0], 0 + 2) = max(1, 2) = 2

So, maximum is 2.

For Case 2: houses 1 to n-1 = [2,3]

DP array:

- dp[0] = 2

- dp[1] = max(dp[0], 0 + 3) = max(2, 3) = 3

So, maximum is 3.

Overall maximum: 3.

Which is correct.

So, in my initial approach, I mistakenly thought that in Case 1, I could rob house 0 and house 2, but in reality, in Case 1, I'm only considering houses 0 and 1.

Therefore, the correct approach is to:

- Compute the maximum for houses 0 to n-2.

- Compute the maximum for houses 1 to n-1.

- Return the maximum of these two.

This handles the circular dependency correctly.

Edge cases to consider:

- Only one house: nums = [a], should return a.

- Two houses: nums = [a, b], should return max(a, b).

- Three houses: nums = [a, b, c], should return max(a+c, b).

Wait, but in the third example, nums = [1,2,3], according to our approach:

- Case 1: houses 0 and 1: max(1, 2) = 2

- Case 2: houses 1 and 2: max(2, 3) = 3

- Overall maximum: 3

Which is correct.

Another edge case: nums = [0,0,0], should return 0.

 nums = [1,3,1], should return 3.

 nums = [2,1,1,2], should return 4 (rob house 0 and 2: 2+2=4)

Wait, but according to our approach:

- Case 1: houses 0 to n-2: [2,1,1] → DP: dp[0]=2, dp[1]=max(2,1)=2, dp[2]=max(2,2+1)=3 → max=3

- Case 2: houses 1 to n-1: [1,1,2] → DP: dp[0]=1, dp[1]=max(1,1)=1, dp[2]=max(1,1+2)=3 → max=3

- Overall maximum: 3

But allegedly, the maximum should be 4 by robbing house 0 and house 3, but in our approach, house 0 and house 2 are considered in Case 1, and house 1 and house 3 in Case 2.

Wait, perhaps my approach is missing something.

Wait, in this arrangement:

- House 0: 2

- House 1: 1

- House 2: 1

- House 3: 2

In Case 1: houses 0,1,2: [2,1,1] → DP: dp[0]=2, dp[1]=max(2,1)=2, dp[2]=max(2,2+1)=3 → max=3

In Case 2: houses 1,2,3: [1,1,2] → DP: dp[0]=1, dp[1]=max(1,1)=1, dp[2]=max(1,1+2)=3 → max=3

Overall maximum: 3

But actually, if I rob house 0 and house 3, which are not adjacent in the circular arrangement, I get 2 + 2 = 4.

But in our approach, in Case 1, I can't rob house 3, and in Case 2, I can't rob house 0.

So, how to handle this?

Wait, perhaps my initial approach is flawed.

Alternative approach:

Since the houses are in a circle, robbing house 0 prevents robbing house n-1, and vice versa.

So, I can consider two scenarios:

- Not robbing house 0: then I can rob house n-1.

- Not robbing house n-1: then I can rob house 0.

Wait, but in the first scenario, if I don't rob house 0, I can consider houses 1 to n-1.

In the second scenario, if I don't rob house n-1, I can consider houses 0 to n-2.

Then, compute the maximum for each scenario and take the maximum of the two.

This is similar to my initial approach.

But in the example above, this approach doesn't allow robbing house 0 and house 3, which are non-adjacent in the circular arrangement.

Wait, but in Case 1, I consider houses 0 to n-2: [0,1,2], which allows robbing house 0 and house 2, but not house 3.

In Case 2, I consider houses 1 to n-1: [1,2,3], which allows robbing house 1 and house 3, but not house 0.

So, in neither case can I rob both house 0 and house 3.

Hence, my initial approach misses this possibility.

So, perhaps I need a different strategy.

Alternative idea:

- Treat the circular arrangement as two separate linear arrangements:

- One from house 0 to house n-2.

- One from house 1 to house n-1.

- Compute the maximum for each using linear DP.

- Return the maximum of these two.

But as seen in the example above, this doesn't allow robbing house 0 and house 3.

Wait, but in the circular arrangement, house 0 and house 3 are adjacent, so I shouldn't be able to rob both.

In the example I gave, house 0 and house 3 are adjacent because it's a circle, so robbing both would trigger the alarm.

So, in that case, my initial approach seems correct.

Wait, in the example I provided, house 0 and house 3 are adjacent in the circle, so I shouldn't be able to rob both.

But according to my initial approach, in neither case can I rob both house 0 and house 3.

In Case 1, I can rob house 0 and house 2.

In Case 2, I can rob house 1 and house 3.

Then, the maximum would be max(2+1=3, 1+2=3)=3.

But I thought that robbing house 0 and house 3 would give 2+2=4, but since they are adjacent in the circle, I shouldn't be able to do that.

Wait, perhaps I misjudged the adjacency.

Let me visualize the houses in a circle:

- House 0: 2

- House 1: 1

- House 2: 1

- House 3: 2

In the circle: 0-1-2-3-0.

So, house 0 is adjacent to house 1 and house 3.

House 1 is adjacent to house 0 and house 2.

House 2 is adjacent to house 1 and house 3.

House 3 is adjacent to house 0 and house 2.

So, in this arrangement, house 0 and house 3 are adjacent, so I can't rob both.

Therefore, the maximum should indeed be 3, not 4.

I must have miscalculated earlier.

Therefore, my initial approach seems correct.

So, to summarize, the approach is:

- Handle two cases:

- Case 1: Rob houses from 0 to n-2.

- Case 2: Rob houses from 1 to n-1.

- For each case, use the standard linear DP approach to find the maximum amount that can be robbed.

- Return the maximum of the two cases.

Now, I need to implement this in Python.

First, I need a helper function to compute the maximum robable amount for a linear arrangement of houses.

Let's define a function `rob_linear(nums)` that takes a list of integers and returns the maximum amount that can be robbed from them, assuming they are in a line.

Then, in the main function, I'll call this helper function twice: once for houses 0 to n-2, and once for houses 1 to n-1, and return the maximum of the two.

Edge cases to consider:

- If there is only one house, return its value.

- If there are two houses, return the maximum of the two.

- If all houses have zero money, return zero.

- If the houses are arranged in a way that the maximum is achieved by robbing non-adjacent houses that include both house 0 and house n-1, but in reality, in a circular arrangement, house 0 and house n-1 are adjacent, so I can't rob both.

I need to ensure that the approach correctly handles the circular dependency.

Let me try another example.

Suppose nums = [5,3,4,11]

- Houses in a circle: 0(5)-1(3)-2(4)-3(11)-0(5)

- Case 1: houses 0,1,2: [5,3,4] → DP: dp[0]=5, dp[1]=max(5,3)=5, dp[2]=max(5,5+4)=9 → max=9

- Case 2: houses 1,2,3: [3,4,11] → DP: dp[0]=3, dp[1]=max(3,4)=4, dp[2]=max(4,3+11)=14 → max=14

- Overall maximum: 14

But in this arrangement, house 0 and house 3 are adjacent, so I can't rob both.

In Case 1, I rob house 0 and house 2: 5 + 4 = 9

In Case 2, I rob house 1 and house 3: 3 + 11 = 14

So, the maximum is 14, which is correct.

Another example: nums = [100,1,1,100]

- Case 1: houses 0,1,2: [100,1,1] → DP: dp[0]=100, dp[1]=max(100,1)=100, dp[2]=max(100,100+1)=101 → max=101

- Case 2: houses 1,2,3: [1,1,100] → DP: dp[0]=1, dp[1]=max(1,1)=1, dp[2]=max(1,1+100)=101 → max=101

- Overall maximum: 101

Which makes sense because I can rob house 0 and house 2: 100 + 1 = 101, or house 1 and house 3: 1 + 100 = 101.

Now, implement the `rob_linear` function.

For the linear case, I can use DP with O(n) space, but to optimize, I can use two variables to keep track of the previous two maximums.

Here's how I can implement `rob_linear`:

def rob_linear(nums):

if not nums:

return 0

if len(nums) == 1:

return nums[0]

if len(nums) == 2:

return max(nums[0], nums[1])

# Initialize variables to store the previous two maxima

prev_prev = nums[0]

prev = max(nums[0], nums[1])

for i in range(2, len(nums)):

# Current max is either the previous max or the current house plus the max two steps back

current = max(prev, prev_prev + nums[i])

prev_prev = prev

prev = current

return prev

This function iterates through the list, keeping track of the maximum amount that can be robbed up to the current house.

Now, in the main function, I'll handle the circular case by calling `rob_linear` on two subsets: houses[0:n-1] and houses[1:n], and return the maximum of the two.

def rob(nums):

if not nums:

return 0

if len(nums) == 1:

return nums[0]

if len(nums) == 2:

return max(nums[0], nums[1])

# Rob houses from 0 to n-2

max1 = rob_linear(nums[0:-1])

# Rob houses from 1 to n-1

max2 = rob_linear(nums[1:])

return max(max1, max2)

This should cover all scenarios.

Let me test this with the earlier example where I thought there was a mistake.

nums = [2,1,1,2]

- Case 1: houses 0,1,2: [2,1,1] → rob_linear returns 3 (rob house 0 and house 2: 2+1=3)

- Case 2: houses 1,2,3: [1,1,2] → rob_linear returns 3 (rob house 1 and house 3: 1+2=3)

- Overall maximum: 3

Which is correct, as robbing house 0 and house 3 together is not allowed due to adjacency in the circle.

Another test case: nums = [2,1,1,1]

- Case 1: houses 0,1,2: [2,1,1] → rob_linear returns 3 (rob house 0 and house 2: 2+1=3)

- Case 2: houses 1,2,3: [1,1,1] → rob_linear returns 2 (rob house 1 and house 3: 1+1=2)

- Overall maximum: 3

Which is correct.

One more test case: nums = [1,1,1,1]

- Case 1: houses 0,1,2: [1,1,1] → rob_linear returns 2 (rob house 0 and house 2: 1+1=2)

- Case 2: houses 1,2,3: [1,1,1] → rob_linear returns 2 (rob house 1 and house 3: 1+1=2)

- Overall maximum: 2

Which is correct.

Seems like the approach is solid.

Now, to further optimize, I can integrate the linear DP logic directly into the main function to make it more efficient, but for clarity, having a separate helper function is fine.

I'll proceed with this implementation.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the amount of money we can rob from houses arranged in a circle without triggering the alarm by robbing adjacent houses.

### Approach
1. **Problem Understanding:** Each house has a certain amount of money, and houses are connected in a circle, meaning the first and last houses are adjacent.
2. **Key Constraint:** Cannot rob two adjacent houses.
3. **Optimal Solution:** Use dynamic programming to solve for two scenarios:
   - Rob houses from the first to the second-to-last house.
   - Rob houses from the second to the last house.
   - Then, take the maximum of these two scenarios.

4. **Helper Function:** Implement a linear DP function to handle the non-circular cases.

**Constraints:**

*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest palindrome that can be created by adding characters only in front of the given string `s`. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.

### Approach

1. **Identify the Longest Palindromic Prefix:**
   - The key is to find the longest prefix of `s` that is a palindrome.
   - Once we have this, the remaining substring (from the end of this prefix to the end of `s`) is the part that needs to be reversed and added to the front of `s` to make the entire string a palindrome.

2. **KMP Algorithm for Efficient Calculation:**
   - We can use the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm to find the longest palindromic prefix efficiently.
   - By modifying the KMP prefix function, we can determine the largest suffix of `s` that matches a prefix of the reversed `s`.

3. **Construct the Shortest Palindrome:**
   - Once we have the length of the longest palindromic prefix, we can slice the part of `s` that is not in this prefix, reverse it, and prepend it to `s`.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the kth largest element in an array of integers. The challenge is to achieve this in O(n) time complexity. At first glance, sorting the array comes to mind, but sorting would take O(n log n) time, which doesn't meet the requirement. Therefore, we need a more efficient approach.

One effective way to find the kth largest element in linear time is by using a min-heap of size k. The idea is to maintain a heap of the k largest elements seen so far. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization**: Create a min-heap (a heap where the smallest element is at the root) with the first k elements of the array.
2. **Processing Remaining Elements**: For each of the remaining elements in the array:
   - If the element is larger than the smallest element in the heap (which is the root of the min-heap), remove the smallest element and add the new element to the heap.
   - This ensures that the heap always contains the k largest elements seen so far.
3. **Result**: After processing all elements, the root of the heap will be the kth largest element.

This approach works because:
- Maintaining the heap of size k takes O(k) time initially.
- For each of the remaining (n - k) elements, we perform a heap replacement operation, which takes O(log k) time.
- Therefore, the total time complexity is O(k + (n - k) log k), which is O(n log k) in the worst case.

However, in practice, this is efficient and often acceptable. But the problem specifically requires O(n) time complexity. To achieve this, we can use a selection algorithm based on the quicksort partitioning method, known as quickselect.

### Approach: Quickselect

Quickselect is an in-place variant of the quicksort algorithm that allows us to find the kth smallest (or largest) element in linear time on average.

#### Algorithm Steps:

1. **Partitioning**:
   - Choose a pivot element from the array.
   - Rearrange the array such that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it.
   - This step is similar to the partition step in quicksort.

2. **Recursion**:
   - If the pivot's position is equal to (n - k), where n is the length of the array, then the pivot is the kth largest element.
   - If the pivot's position is greater than (n - k), recursively search in the left subarray.
   - If the pivot's position is less than (n - k), recursively search in the right subarray.

This approach has an average time complexity of O(n), which meets the problem's requirement.

### Approach

1. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - Check each element against every other element in the array.
   - This would involve nested loops, resulting in O(n^2) time complexity, which is inefficient for large arrays.

2. **Sorting Approach**:
   - Sort the array first.
   - Then, check adjacent elements for duplicates.
   - Sorting takes O(n log n) time, and checking adjacent elements takes O(n) time.

3. **Hash Set Approach**:
   - Use a set to track seen numbers.
   - Iterate through the array, and for each number, check if it's already in the set.
   - If it is, return `True` (duplicate found).
   - If not, add it to the set.
   - This approach has O(n) time complexity since set operations are O(1) on average.

Given the constraints (`1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`), efficiency is crucial, so the hash set approach is the best choice.

Difficulty: Hard
Original Question: A city's **skyline** is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return _the **skyline** formed by these buildings collectively_.

The geometric information of each building is given in the array `buildings` where `buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]`:

*   `lefti` is the x coordinate of the left edge of the `ith` building.
*   `righti` is the x coordinate of the right edge of the `ith` building.
*   `heighti` is the height of the `ith` building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`.

The **skyline** should be represented as a list of "key points " **sorted by their x-coordinate** in the form `[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

**Note:** There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]`

CoT: Alright, I'm trying to solve this skyline problem. So, the task is to compute the skyline of a city given the locations and heights of all its buildings. The skyline should be represented as a list of key points sorted by their x-coordinate, where each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline, except the last point which marks the termination with a y-coordinate of 0.

First, I need to understand what the skyline really is. It's the outer contour you see when looking at the city from a distance. So, it should capture the highest building at each x-coordinate, and the points where the height changes.

Given that, I need to find all the points where the maximum height changes as we move from left to right across the city. These points are either the start or end of some building, because that's where the height can potentially change.

So, one approach is to consider all the edges (both left and right) of the buildings as events that can cause a change in the skyline. I can sort these events by their x-coordinate and process them in order.

For each event, I need to determine the new maximum height at that x-coordinate. If this maximum height is different from the previous maximum, then this event is a key point in the skyline.

But, how do I efficiently keep track of the current maximum height as I process these events?

I think using a heap (priority queue) could be useful here, because it can efficiently keep track of the current maximum height. Specifically, a max heap where the heap property is maintained based on the height of the buildings.

Here's a rough plan:

1. **Split buildings into events**: Create a list of events, where each event is either the left edge or the right edge of a building. Each event should contain the x-coordinate, the height (if it's a left edge), and a flag indicating if it's a left or right edge.

2. **Sort events**: Sort these events by their x-coordinate. If two events have the same x-coordinate, process left edges before right edges to ensure we include the new building's height at that point.

3. **Process events**:

   - Initialize an empty heap to keep track of the current heights of active buildings (buildings that have started but not yet ended).
   
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the current maximum height.
   
   - For each event:
   
     - If it's a left edge, add the building's height to the heap.
     
     - If it's a right edge, remove the building's height from the heap. (This requires a way to efficiently remove specific elements from the heap, which is tricky because standard heaps don't support efficient removal of arbitrary elements. I might need to handle this differently.)
     
     - After updating the heap, check if the current maximum height (the root of the heap) has changed.
     
     - If it has changed, record the new key point at the current x-coordinate with the new height.
     
4. **Handle heap operations efficiently**: Since standard heaps don't support efficient removal of arbitrary elements, I need a different approach for removing heights when a building's right edge is processed. One common technique is to use a "sweep line" algorithm with a max heap, where you don't immediately remove the building when you encounter its right edge, but instead keep it in the heap and only consider heights of buildings that are still active at the current x-coordinate.

Wait, that sounds promising. So, instead of removing buildings immediately when their right edge is encountered, I can keep them in the heap and, when determining the current maximum height, ignore buildings that have already ended before the current x-coordinate.

Here's a refined plan:

- **Events**: Create a list of events, where each event is a tuple containing:

  - The x-coordinate of the event.

  - The height of the building (or a marker for right edges).

  - A flag indicating if it's a left or right edge.

- **Sorting**: Sort the events by x-coordinate. If two events have the same x-coordinate, process left edges before right edges.

- **Heap and active buildings**: Use a max heap to keep track of the heights of active buildings. Also, maintain a separate list or set to keep track of buildings that have already ended but are still in the heap.

- **Processing events**:

  - For each event:

    - If it's a left edge, add the building's height to the heap.

    - If it's a right edge, mark the building's height as ended, but don't remove it from the heap immediately.

    - While the top of the heap contains heights of buildings that have already ended (their right edge is before the current x-coordinate), remove them from the heap.

    - After cleaning the heap, check the new top of the heap, which is the current maximum height.

    - If this height is different from the previous maximum height, record a key point at the current x-coordinate with the new height.

- **Termination**: At the end, make sure to add a key point where the skyline ends, with y-coordinate 0.

I need to be careful with the data structures I use. Since the number of buildings can be up to 10^4, and for each building, there are two events, the total number of events is up to 2*10^4, which is manageable.

Also, I need to handle the heap operations efficiently. In Python, the `heapq` module provides a min-heap, but I need a max-heap. To simulate a max-heap, I can invert the heights when pushing them onto the heap.

Let me think about how to implement the active buildings and handling the ended buildings.

I can keep a heap of tuples where each tuple is (-height, right_edge), so that the heap is ordered by height in descending order. The negative height is used to simulate a max-heap.

Then, when processing events:

- For a left edge event: push (-height, right_edge) onto the heap.

- For a right edge event: don't push anything, but mark that the building with this right_edge has ended.

- After processing all events up to the current x-coordinate, remove from the heap any buildings where right_edge <= current x-coordinate.

- The current maximum height is then -heap[0][0], assuming the heap is not empty. If the heap is empty, the height is 0.

- If this height is different from the previous height, record a key point.

I need to keep track of the previous height to detect changes.

Also, I need to process events in order, and ensure that for the same x-coordinate, left edges are processed before right edges to correctly capture the height at that point.

Let me try to write a small example to verify this logic.

Take the first example from the problem:

buildings = [[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]]

So, the events would be:

- x=2, height=10, left edge

- x=3, height=15, left edge

- x=5, height=12, left edge

- x=7, height=15, right edge

- x=9, height=10, right edge

- x=12, height=12, right edge

- x=15, height=10, left edge

- x=20, height=10, right edge

- x=19, height=8, left edge

- x=24, height=8, right edge

Sort these events by x-coordinate, and for same x, left before right.

So, sorted events:

1. x=2, height=10, left

2. x=3, height=15, left

3. x=5, height=12, left

4. x=7, height=15, right

5. x=9, height=10, right

6. x=12, height=12, right

7. x=15, height=10, left

8. x=19, height=8, left

9. x=20, height=10, right

10. x=24, height=8, right

Now, process these events one by one:

Initialize:

- heap: empty

- prev_height = 0

- skyline: empty

Event 1: x=2, height=10, left

- push (-10, 9) onto heap

- heap: [(-10, 9)]

- current max height: 10

- prev_height = 0, which is different from 10

- add [2, 10] to skyline

Event 2: x=3, height=15, left

- push (-15, 7) onto heap

- heap: [(-15, 7), (-10, 9)]

- current max height: 15

- prev_height = 10, which is different from 15

- add [3, 15] to skyline

Event 3: x=5, height=12, left

- push (-12, 12) onto heap

- heap: [(-15, 7), (-12, 12), (-10, 9)]

- current max height: 15

- prev_height = 15, no change

- no new skyline point

Event 4: x=7, height=15, right

- building with right=7 has ended

- remove any buildings from heap where right <= 7

- heap before: [(-15, 7), (-12, 12), (-10, 9)]

- remove (-15, 7) because right=7 <= x=7

- heap after: [(-12, 12), (-10, 9)]

- current max height: 12

- prev_height = 15, which is different from 12

- add [7, 12] to skyline

Event 5: x=9, height=10, right

- building with right=9 has ended

- remove any buildings from heap where right <= 9

- heap before: [(-12, 12), (-10, 9)]

- remove (-10, 9) because right=9 <= x=9

- heap after: [(-12, 12)]

- current max height: 12

- prev_height = 12, no change

- no new skyline point

Event 6: x=12, height=12, right

- building with right=12 has ended

- remove any buildings from heap where right <= 12

- heap before: [(-12, 12)]

- remove (-12, 12) because right=12 <= x=12

- heap after: empty

- current max height: 0

- prev_height = 12, which is different from 0

- add [12, 0] to skyline

Event 7: x=15, height=10, left

- push (-10, 20) onto heap

- heap: [(-10, 20)]

- current max height: 10

- prev_height = 0, which is different from 10

- add [15, 10] to skyline

Event 8: x=19, height=8, left

- push (-8, 24) onto heap

- heap: [(-10, 20), (-8, 24)]

- current max height: 10

- prev_height = 10, no change

- no new skyline point

Event 9: x=20, height=10, right

- building with right=20 has ended

- remove any buildings from heap where right <= 20

- heap before: [(-10, 20), (-8, 24)]

- remove (-10, 20) because right=20 <= x=20

- heap after: [(-8, 24)]

- current max height: 8

- prev_height = 10, which is different from 8

- add [20, 8] to skyline

Event 10: x=24, height=8, right

- building with right=24 has ended

- remove any buildings from heap where right <= 24

- heap before: [(-8, 24)]

- remove (-8, 24) because right=24 <= x=24

- heap after: empty

- current max height: 0

- prev_height = 8, which is different from 0

- add [24, 0] to skyline

Final skyline: [[2,10], [3,15], [7,12], [12,0], [15,10], [20,8], [24,0]]

This matches the first example's output. Great!

Now, let's consider the second example:

buildings = [[0,2,3],[2,5,3]]

Events:

1. x=0, height=3, left

2. x=2, height=3, right

3. x=2, height=3, left

4. x=5, height=3, right

Sort these events:

1. x=0, height=3, left

2. x=2, height=3, left

3. x=2, height=3, right

4. x=5, height=3, right

Process these events:

Initialize:

- heap: empty

- prev_height = 0

- skyline: empty

Event 1: x=0, height=3, left

- push (-3, 2) onto heap

- heap: [(-3, 2)]

- current max height: 3

- prev_height = 0, which is different from 3

- add [0,3] to skyline

Event 2: x=2, height=3, left

- push (-3, 5) onto heap

- heap: [(-3, 5), (-3, 2)]

- current max height: 3

- prev_height = 3, no change

- no new skyline point

Event 3: x=2, height=3, right

- building with right=2 has ended

- remove any buildings from heap where right <=2

- heap before: [(-3, 5), (-3, 2)]

- remove (-3, 2) because right=2 <= x=2

- heap after: [(-3, 5)]

- current max height: 3

- prev_height = 3, no change

- no new skyline point

Event 4: x=5, height=3, right

- building with right=5 has ended

- remove any buildings from heap where right <=5

- heap before: [(-3, 5)]

- remove (-3, 5) because right=5 <= x=5

- heap after: empty

- current max height: 0

- prev_height = 3, which is different from 0

- add [5,0] to skyline

Final skyline: [[0,3], [5,0]]

This matches the second example's output.

Seems like the logic is solid.

Now, I need to implement this in Python. I need to be careful with the following:

- Using a max heap by negating the heights.

- Handling the removal of buildings from the heap correctly by removing buildings that have already ended.

- Ensuring that events are sorted correctly, with left edges processed before right edges at the same x-coordinate.

- Keeping track of the previous height to only add key points when the height changes.

Also, since the buildings are sorted by lefti in non-decreasing order, but events can have overlapping or adjacent buildings, I need to handle that correctly.

Edge cases to consider:

- Buildings with the same left and right edges.

- Buildings that start and end at the same x-coordinate.

- Buildings with the same height.

- Buildings that are fully contained within another building.

- The last building's end point.

I should also consider the constraints:

- 1 <= buildings.length <= 10^4

- 0 <= lefti < righti <= 2^31 - 1

- 1 <= heighti <= 2^31 - 1

So, I need to make sure that the solution is efficient enough, probably O(N log N) time complexity due to sorting and heap operations.

In Python, the `heapq` module provides a min-heap, so I'll use negative heights to simulate a max-heap.

I'll also need to use a list to store the events and sort it.

Let me start writing the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to compute the skyline of a city given the locations and heights of all its buildings. The skyline should be represented as a list of key points sorted by their x-coordinate, where each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline, except the last point which marks the termination with a y-coordinate of 0.

### Approach

1. **Split buildings into events**: Create a list of events, where each event is either the left edge or the right edge of a building. Each event contains the x-coordinate, the height (if it's a left edge), and a flag indicating if it's a left or right edge.
  
2. **Sort events**: Sort these events by their x-coordinate. If two events have the same x-coordinate, process left edges before right edges to ensure we include the new building's height at that point.

3. **Process events**:
   - Use a max heap to keep track of the heights of active buildings.
   - Keep track of the current maximum height and update it as we process each event.
   - For each event:
     - If it's a left edge, add the building's height to the heap.
     - If it's a right edge, remove the building's height from the heap.
     - After updating the heap, check if the current maximum height has changed.
     - If it has changed, record the new key point at the current x-coordinate with the new height.

4. **Handle heap operations efficiently**: Use a max heap to keep track of the heights of active buildings. When processing a right edge, remove the building's height from the heap. Use a separate list to keep track of buildings that have already ended but are still in the heap.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `0 <= k <= 105`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array `nums` such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is at most `k`. 

### Approach

1. **Brute Force Approach**: Check every pair of indices to see if they meet the conditions. This approach is inefficient and has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not suitable for large arrays.

2. **Optimized Approach Using a Dictionary**:
    - Use a dictionary to store the most recent index of each element.
    - Iterate through the array, and for each element, check if it has been seen before.
    - If it has been seen, calculate the absolute difference between the current index and the stored index.
    - If the difference is less than or equal to `k`, return `True`.
    - Update the dictionary with the current index for the element.
    - If no such pair is found by the end of the array, return `False`.

This approach ensures that we only make one pass through the array, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), which is efficient for the given constraints.

Original Question: You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `indexDiff` and `valueDiff`.

Find a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that:

*   `i != j`,
*   `abs(i - j) <= indexDiff`.
*   `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valueDiff`, and

Return `true` _if such pair exists or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\], indexDiff = 3, valueDiff = 0
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** We can choose (i, j) = (0, 3).
We satisfy the three conditions:
i != j --> 0 != 3
abs(i - j) <= indexDiff --> abs(0 - 3) <= 3
abs(nums\[i\] - nums\[j\]) <= valueDiff --> abs(1 - 1) <= 0

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,5,9,1,5,9\], indexDiff = 2, valueDiff = 3
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** After trying all the possible pairs (i, j), we cannot satisfy the three conditions, so we return false.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `1 <= indexDiff <= nums.length`
*   `0 <= valueDiff <= 109`

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find two indices `i` and `j` in the array `nums` such that:

1. `i!= j`

2. `abs(i - j) <= indexDiff`

3. `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valueDiff`

Given the constraints, especially the large size of the array (`2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`), we need an efficient solution that avoids checking all possible pairs, which would be O(n^2) and too slow.

### Approach

We can use a sliding window approach combined with a data structure that allows us to efficiently check for the existence of elements within a certain range. A suitable data structure for this purpose is a balanced binary search tree (BST), which in Python can be implemented using the `bisect` module for maintaining sorted lists.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Sliding Window:** We maintain a window of size `indexDiff` and check for the conditions within this window as we slide it across the array.

2. **Sorted List:** Within the window, we keep the elements sorted to efficiently check if there exists any pair of elements that satisfy `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valueDiff`.

3. **Efficient Insertion and Removal:** As we slide the window, we need to efficiently add new elements and remove elements that are no longer in the window.

4. **Checking for Conditions:** For each new element added to the window, we check if there is any element in the current window's sorted list that is within `valueDiff` of the new element.

from bisect import insort, bisect_left, bisect_right

                # Remove the element that is no longer in the window
                window.remove(nums[i - indexDiff - 1])
                window.sort()  # Re-sort after removal
            # Find the lower and upper bounds for the valueDiff condition
            pos = bisect_left(window, nums[i] - valueDiff)
            if pos < len(window) and window[pos] <= nums[i] + valueDiff:
                return True
            insort(window, nums[i])

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to construct an auxiliary size matrix `dp` where each cell `dp[i][j]` represents the size of the side of the largest square sub-matrix ending at cell `(i, j)` in the given matrix.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a 2D list `dp` of the same dimensions as the input matrix, initialized with 0's.
   - The first row and the first column of `dp` are initialized to be the same as the input matrix since the largest square that can end at these positions is of size 1 if the cell contains '1'.

2. **Filling the dp table**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)` starting from `(1, 1)`, if the cell contains '1', then `dp[i][j]` is the minimum of its left, top, and top-left diagonal cells in `dp` plus 1.
   - This is because for a square to be formed, all three preceding positions must also form a square.

3. **Tracking the maximum side length**:
   - While filling the `dp` table, keep track of the maximum value in `dp`, which represents the side length of the largest square.

4. **Calculating the area**:
   - The area of the largest square is the square of the maximum side length found.

*   `0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 104`
*   The tree is guaranteed to be **complete**.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to count the number of nodes in a complete binary tree efficiently, ideally in less than O(n) time complexity. Given that the tree is complete, we can leverage its properties to achieve a better time complexity.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Complete Binary Trees:**
   - In a complete binary tree, all levels except possibly the last are completely filled.
   - The last level has all nodes as left as possible.

2. **Time Complexity Consideration:**
   - A naive approach would be to traverse all nodes, which is O(n).
   - However, we aim for a better time complexity by exploiting the complete binary tree properties.

3. **Key Insight:**
   - For a complete binary tree, if the tree is full up to height `h`, the number of nodes is `2^h - 1`.
   - We can check the height of the left and right subtrees.
   - If they are equal, the left subtree is full, and we can calculate its nodes directly.
   - If not, recursively count nodes in the left and right subtrees.

4. **Algorithm Steps:**
   - Determine the height of the leftmost path (left height).
   - Determine the height of the rightmost path (right height).
   - If left height equals right height, the tree is full, and we use the formula `2^h - 1`.
   - If not, recursively count nodes in the left and right subtrees and add 1 for the root.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total area covered by two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane. Rectilinear rectangles have sides parallel to the x and y axes, which simplifies the calculations.

### Approach

1. **Calculate Individual Areas:**
   - First, calculate the area of each rectangle separately. The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its width and height.
   - For the first rectangle: `area_a = (ax2 - ax1) * (ay2 - ay1)`
   - For the second rectangle: `area_b = (bx2 - bx1) * (by2 - by1)`

2. **Calculate Overlapping Area:**
   - Determine if the rectangles overlap. If they do, calculate the area of their overlap and subtract it once from the sum of their areas, because the overlapping area is counted twice when adding the individual areas.
   - To find the overlapping area, determine the overlapping width and height:
     - Overlapping width: The maximum of the left edges minus the minimum of the right edges.
     - Overlapping height: The maximum of the bottom edges minus the minimum of the top edges.
   - If the calculated overlap width or height is negative, it means there is no overlap in that dimension, and thus no overlapping area.

3. **Total Area:**
   - The total area covered by the two rectangles is the sum of their individual areas minus the area of their overlap (if any).

### Solution Code

Original Question: Given a string `s` representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return _the result of the evaluation_.

**Note:** You are **not** allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "1 + 1 "
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  " 2-1 + 2  "
**Output:** 3

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8) "
**Output:** 23

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105`
*   `s` consists of digits, `'+'`, `'-'`, `'('`, `')'`, and `' '`.
*   `s` represents a valid expression.
*   `'+'` is **not** used as a unary operation (i.e., `"+1 "` and `"+(2 + 3) "` is invalid).
*   `'-'` could be used as a unary operation (i.e., `"-1 "` and `"-(2 + 3) "` is valid).
*   There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
*   Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to implement a basic calculator that can evaluate a given mathematical expression represented as a string. The expression can contain digits, addition (+), subtraction (-), parentheses, and spaces. We are not allowed to use any built-in functions that directly evaluate the expression, such as `eval()`.

### Approach

1. **Tokenization**: Convert the input string into a list of tokens, where each token is either a number, an operator, or a parenthesis.
2. **Parsing**: Use a stack to handle parentheses and maintain the current result and sign.
3. **Evaluation**: Iterate through the tokens, handling numbers, operators, and parentheses accordingly.

Original Question: Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (`push`, `top`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyStack` class:

*   `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
*   `int pop()` Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
*   `int top()` Returns the element on the top of the stack.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the stack is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

*   You must use **only** standard operations of a queue, which means that only `push to back`, `peek/pop from front`, `size` and `is empty` operations are valid.
*   Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "MyStack ",  "push ",  "push ",  "top ",  "pop ",  "empty "\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 2, 2, false\]

**Explanation**
MyStack myStack = new MyStack();
myStack.push(1);
myStack.push(2);
myStack.top(); // return 2
myStack.pop(); // return 2
myStack.empty(); // return False

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= x <= 9`
*   At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `empty`.
*   All the calls to `pop` and `top` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the stack using only one queue?
CoT: To implement a stack using two queues, we need to simulate the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) behavior using FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues. Queues follow the FIFO principle, meaning the first element added is the first one to be removed. Stacks, on the other hand, follow the LIFO principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed.

### Approach

We will use two queues, `queue1` and `queue2`, to achieve this. The main idea is to use one queue for storing the elements in the stack order and use the second queue as a temporary holder when pushing new elements.

1. **Push Operation:**
   - Add the new element to `queue2`.
   - Move all elements from `queue1` to `queue2` to maintain the order.
   - Swap the names of `queue1` and `queue2` so that `queue1` always contains the elements in the correct order.

2. **Pop Operation:**
   - Remove and return the front element of `queue1`.

3. **Top Operation:**
   - Return the front element of `queue1` without removing it.

4. **Empty Operation:**
   - Check if `queue1` is empty.

### Solution Code
Response: python
class MyStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.queue1 = []
        self.queue2 = []

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        # Push the element into queue2
        self.queue2.append(x)
        # Move all elements from queue1 to queue2
        while self.queue1:
            self.queue2.append(self.queue1.pop(0))
        # Swap queue1 and queue2
        self.queue1, self.queue2 = self.queue2, self.queue1

    def pop(self) -> int:
        # Remove and return the front element of queue1
        return self.queue1.pop(0)

    def top(self) -> int:
        # Return the front element of queue1
        return self.queue1[0]

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to invert a binary tree, which means swapping the left and right children of every node in the tree. We can achieve this using a recursive approach.

## Approach
1. **Base Case:** If the tree is empty (i.e., the root is `None`), return `None`.
2. **Swap Children:** For the current node, swap its left and right children.
3. **Recursive Step:** Recursively invert the left and right subtrees.

This approach ensures that every node in the tree has its children swapped, effectively inverting the entire tree.

The expression consists of non-negative integers and the operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`, with division truncating towards zero. The expression is guaranteed to be valid.

### Approach

1. **Tokenization**: First, we need to tokenize the input string, separating numbers and operators. We'll ignore spaces and build numbers from consecutive digits.

2. **Operator Precedence**: Multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction. We need to handle these operations accordingly.

3. **Using Stacks**: We can use a stack to handle the operations. We'll process the expression in one pass, pushing numbers onto the stack and applying multiplication and division as we encounter them. Addition and subtraction will be handled at the end.

4. **Final Calculation**: After processing the entire string, we'll sum up the numbers on the stack to get the final result.

Each range `[a,b]` in the list should be output as:

1. **Initialization**: We'll iterate through the array while keeping track of the start and end of the current range.
2. **Range Detection**: For each number, we check if it is consecutive to the previous one. If it is, we extend the current range. If not, we close the current range and start a new one.
3. **Formatting**: For each range, if the start and end are the same, we represent it as a single number. Otherwise, we use the "start->end" format.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find all elements in an array that appear more than `⌊n/3⌋` times, where `n` is the length of the array. The challenge is to do this in linear time and using constant space.

### Approach

1. **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**: This algorithm is efficient for finding majority elements in an array. Since we're dealing with elements that appear more than `⌊n/3⌋` times, at most two such elements can exist in the array.
2. **Two Candidates**: We'll maintain two candidates and their counts. As we iterate through the array, we'll update these candidates and their counts based on specific conditions.
3. **Verification**: After identifying the candidates, we'll verify if they indeed appear more than `⌊n/3⌋` times in the array.

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return _the_ `kth` _smallest value (**1-indexed**) of all the values of the nodes in the tree_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[3,1,4,null,2\], k = 1
**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1\], k = 3

**Follow up:** If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?
CoT: To solve this problem, we can take advantage of the properties of a Binary Search Tree (BST). In a BST, an in-order traversal visits nodes in ascending order. Therefore, performing an in-order traversal and keeping track of the order in which nodes are visited will allow us to find the kth smallest element efficiently.

### Approach

1. **In-Order Traversal**: Perform an in-order traversal of the BST. This involves traversing the left subtree, visiting the root, and then traversing the right subtree.
2. **Tracking the Order**: Keep a counter to track the number of nodes visited during the in-order traversal.
3. **Finding the Kth Smallest Element**: When the counter equals k, record the value of the current node as it is the kth smallest element.

**Constraints:**

*   `-231 <= n <= 231 - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without loops/recursion?
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given integer `n` is a power of two. This means we need to check if `n` can be expressed as `2^x` for some integer `x`.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Powers of Two**:
   - Powers of two in binary representation have only one '1' bit and all other bits are '0'. For example:
     - 1 (decimal) is 1 (binary)
     - 2 (decimal) is 10 (binary)
     - 4 (decimal) is 100 (binary)
     - 8 (decimal) is 1000 (binary)
     - etc.
   - This property can be used to check if a number is a power of two.

2. **Bitwise Operation**:
   - A number `n` is a power of two if and only if `n` and `(n - 1)` have no common set bits. In other words, `n & (n - 1)` should be zero.
   - Additionally, `n` should be greater than zero because zero is not a power of two.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - `n = 1` is `2^0`, which is a power of two.
   - `n = 0` is not a power of two.
   - Negative numbers are not powers of two.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def isPowerOfTwo(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    return (n & (n - 1)) == 0

Original Question: Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyQueue` class:

*   `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
*   `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
*   `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

*   You must use **only** standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
*   Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "MyQueue ",  "push ",  "push ",  "peek ",  "pop ",  "empty "\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 1, 1, false\]

**Explanation**
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: \[1\]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: \[1, 2\] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is \[2\]
myQueue.empty(); // return false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= x <= 9`
*   At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`.
*   All the calls to `pop` and `peek` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the queue such that each operation is **[amortized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis)** `O(1)` time complexity? In other words, performing `n` operations will take overall `O(n)` time even if one of those operations may take longer.

CoT: To implement a queue using two stacks in Python, we need to simulate the FIFO (First In First Out) behavior using the LIFO (Last In First Out) nature of stacks. We'll use two stacks: one for pushing elements (`input_stack`) and another for popping elements (`output_stack`).

### Approach

1. **Push Operation:**
   - Simply push the element onto `input_stack`.

2. **Pop Operation:**
   - If `output_stack` is empty, pop all elements from `input_stack` and push them onto `output_stack`. This reverses the order, making the oldest element in `input_stack` the top element in `output_stack`.
   - Pop the top element from `output_stack`.

3. **Peek Operation:**
   - Similar to pop, but instead of popping, just peek the top element of `output_stack`.

4. **Empty Operation:**
   - Check if both `input_stack` and `output_stack` are empty.

### Solution Code
Response: python
class MyQueue:

    def __init__(self):
        self.input_stack = []
        self.output_stack = []

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.input_stack.append(x)

    def pop(self) -> int:
        self.peek()  # Ensure output_stack has the elements in the correct order
        return self.output_stack.pop()

    def peek(self) -> int:
        if not self.output_stack:
            while self.input_stack:
                self.output_stack.append(self.input_stack.pop())

1. **Digit Analysis**: We will analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) separately to count the occurrences of the digit '1'.
2. **Positional Counting**: For each position, we calculate the count of '1's that appear in that position across all numbers from 0 to `n`.

**Follow up:** Could you do it in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space?
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given singly linked list is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, the list [1,2,2,1] is a palindrome, while [1,2] is not.

### Approach

1. **Finding the Middle:**
   - We'll use the "slow and fast" pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle.

2. **Reversing the Second Half:**
   - Once we have the middle, we'll reverse the second half of the linked list. This allows us to easily compare it with the first half.

3. **Comparing the Two Halves:**
   - We'll then compare the first half with the reversed second half node by node. If all corresponding nodes match, the list is a palindrome.

4. **Restoring the List (Optional):**
   - Optionally, we can reverse the second half again to restore the original list structure, though the problem does not require this.

     - All nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value.
     - All nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.

2. **LCA Characteristics**:
   - The LCA of two nodes `p` and `q` is the lowest node that has both `p` and `q` as descendants.
   - If `p` and `q` are on different sides of the current node, the current node is the LCA.
   - If both `p` and `q` are smaller than the current node, the LCA lies in the left subtree.
   - If both `p` and `q` are larger than the current node, the LCA lies in the right subtree.

3. **Traversal Strategy**:
   - Start from the root.
   - Traverse the tree based on the values of `p` and `q`:
     - If both `p` and `q` are less than the current node's value, move to the left child.
     - If both `p` and `q` are greater than the current node's value, move to the right child.
     - If `p` and `q` are on different sides, the current node is the LCA.

1. **Base Case:** If the root is `None`, or if the root is either p or q, we return the root.
2. **Recursive Case:** We recursively find the LCA in the left subtree and the right subtree.
3. **Combining Results:** 
   - If both the left and right subtrees return a non-None value, it means p and q are on different subtrees, so the current root is the LCA.
   - If only one subtree returns a non-None value, it means both p and q are in that subtree, so we return that subtree's result.

## Solution Code
Response: python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if not root or root == p or root == q:
            return root
        left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        if left and right:
            return root
        return left if left else right

Original Question: There is a singly-linked list `head` and we want to delete a node `node` in it.

You are given the node to be deleted `node`. You will **not be given access** to the first node of `head`.

All the values of the linked list are **unique**, and it is guaranteed that the given node `node` is not the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

*   The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
*   The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
*   All the values before `node` should be in the same order.
*   All the values after `node` should be in the same order.

**Custom testing:**

*   For the input, you should provide the entire linked list `head` and the node to be given `node`. `node` should not be the last node of the list and should be an actual node in the list.
*   We will build the linked list and pass the node to your function.
*   The output will be the entire list after calling your function.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[4,5,1,9\], node = 5
**Output:** \[4,1,9\]
**Explanation:** You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[4,5,1,9\], node = 1
**Output:** \[4,5,9\]
**Explanation:** You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
*   The value of each node in the list is **unique**.
*   The `node` to be deleted is **in the list** and is **not a tail** node.

CoT: I've got this problem where I need to delete a node from a singly-linked list, but I'm only given access to that specific node, not the head of the list. The constraints say that the node isn't the tail and all values are unique, which makes things a bit easier. I need to ensure that the value of the given node no longer exists in the list, and that the list's length decreases by one, maintaining the order of the remaining elements.

First, I need to understand how a singly-linked list works. Each node has a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. Since I don't have access to the head, I can't traverse the list to find the node before the one I need to delete. That means I have to work with only the node that's provided.

Given that I can't access the previous node, I can't adjust its pointer to skip over the node to be deleted. So, the usual method of deleting a node by modifying the previous node's pointer isn't feasible here.

But wait, the problem says that it's guaranteed the node is not the last node. That means the node to be deleted always has a next node. Maybe I can copy the value of the next node into the current node and then remove the next node. That way, the value of the current node is effectively removed from the list, and the list length decreases by one.

Let me think through this step by step:

1. Copy the value of the next node into the current node.

2. Set the current node's next pointer to skip the next node and point directly to the node after it.

This way, the next node is effectively removed, and since we copied its value into the current node, the value of the original current node is no longer in the list.

Let me consider an example to see if this works.

Example 1:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5

After deletion: [4,1,9]

按照我的方法：

- 将当前节点（5）的值替换为下一个节点（1）的值。

- 然后，将当前节点的 next 指向下一个节点的 next，即指向 9。

这样，列表变成 4 -> 1 -> 9，符合预期。

Example 2:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1

After deletion: [4,5,9]

按照我的方法：

- 将当前节点（1）的值替换为下一个节点（9）的值。

- 然后，将当前节点的 next 指向下一个节点的 next，即指向 None。

这样，列表变成 4 -> 5 -> 9, 也符合预期。

看起来这个方法可行。现在，我需要确保在代码中正确实现这一点。

首先，我需要访问节点的 next 属性，检查它是否为 None。根据问题描述，node 不是尾节点，所以 next 不会是 None，但这可能是好的做法，以防万一。

然后，复制 next 节点的值到当前节点。

最后，将当前节点的 next 指向 next 的 next。

在 Python 中，定义一个 singly-linked list 的节点通常如下：

class ListNode:

def __init__(self, value=0, next=None):

self.val = value

self.next = next

那么，我的函数应该接受一个 ListNode 类型的参数 node，并对其进行修改。

函数的签名可能是：

def deleteNode(node: ListNode) -> None:

pass

我需要在函数内部执行上述步骤。

让我写出代码的草稿：

def deleteNode(node: ListNode) -> None:

next_node = node.next

node.val = next_node.val

node.next = next_node.next

这样就可以了。这个函数会修改节点的值和 next 指针，从而有效地删除节点。

但是，我需要考虑内存管理。在许多编程语言中，删除节点还需要确保不再有对被删除节点的引用，以便垃圾回收机制可以释放其内存。在 Python 中，垃圾回收是自动的，所以只要没有变量引用了那个节点，它就会被回收。

在上述代码中，next_node 是一个局部变量，函数执行完毕后会被销毁，只要没有其他变量引用了被删除的节点，它就会被回收。

我需要确认一下，确保没有内存泄漏。

另外，根据问题描述，列表中的值是唯一的，且节点不是尾节点，所以不需要处理值重复或节点是尾部的情况。

我再思考一下，有没有什么边界情况需要处理。

首先，节点不是尾节点，所以 next 不会是 None。

值是唯一的，所以不需要担心值重复导致删除错误。

列表长度至少为 2，因为节点不是尾节点，且有多个节点。

所以，似乎不需要额外的检查。

让我再看看 Example 2：

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1

Output: [4,5,9]

按照我的函数，将 node (1) 的值设为 next_node (9) 的值，然后 node.next 指向 next_node.next，即 None。

所以，列表变成 4 -> 5 -> 9，正确。

另一个例子：

Input: head = [1,2,3,4], node = 3

Output: [1,2,4]

按照我的函数，将 node (3) 的值设为 next_node (4) 的值，然后 node.next 指向 next_node.next，即 None。

所以，列表变成 1 -> 2 -> 4，正确。

似乎没有问题。

我再考虑一下，如果列表只有两个节点，比如 [1,2], node =1。

按照我的函数，将 node (1) 的值设为 next_node (2) 的值，然后 node.next 指向 next_node.next，即 None。

所以，列表变成 [2], 正确。

再看看 node 是第一个节点但不是尾节点的情况。

Input: head = [1,2,3], node =1

Output: [2,3]

按照我的函数，将 node (1) 的值设为 next_node (2) 的值，然后 node.next 指向 next_node.next，即3。

所以，列表变成 [2,3], 正确。

看起来在不同情况下都适用。

我再思考一下时间复杂度和空间复杂度。

时间复杂度是 O(1)，因为只进行了常数次操作。

空间复杂度也是 O(1)，没有使用额外的空间。

这符合要求，因为列表的长度可以达到1000，需要高效的解决方案。

我觉得这个方法很好。

不过，我再看看是否有其他方法。

另一种方法可能是遍历整个列表，找到要删除的节点，然后修改前一个节点的 next 指针。但根据问题描述，我没有访问头节点的权限，所以无法遍历列表，这种方法不可行。

或者，如果我有访问前一个节点的能力，可以修改前一个节点的 next 指针，跳过当前节点。但同样，我没有前一个节点的信息，所以也不行。

所以，最初的方法是唯一可行的方案。

我再检查一下代码，确保没有语法错误或逻辑错误。

def deleteNode(node: ListNode) -> None:

next_node = node.next

node.val = next_node.val

node.next = next_node.next

看起来很简单，没有错误。

我可以在本地测试一下这个函数，看看是否按预期工作。

首先，需要定义 ListNode 类。

class ListNode:

def __init__(self, value=0, next=None):

self.val = value

self.next = next

然后，创建一个示例列表 [4,5,1,9], node =5

创建节点：

n1 = ListNode(4)

n2 = ListNode(5)

n3 = ListNode(1)

n4 = ListNode(9)

连接节点：

n1.next = n2

n2.next = n3

n3.next = n4

现在，node = n2

调用 deleteNode(n2)

执行后，列表应该变成 [4,1,9]

检查 n1.next 是否是 n3，即值为1。

是的，n1.next = n3，n3.val =1

然后 n3.next = n4, 即9

所以，列表是 4 ->1 ->9，正确。

另一个例子，[4,5,1,9], node=1

n1 = ListNode(4)

n2 = ListNode(5)

n3 = ListNode(1)

n4 = ListNode(9)

n1.next = n2

n2.next = n3

n3.next = n4

node = n3

调用 deleteNode(n3)

执行后，n2.val =1, n2.next = n4

等待，按照我的函数，应该是 node.val = next_node.val, node.next = next_node.next

所以，node = n3, next_node = n4

n3.val =9, n3.next = None

然后，n2.next = n3, 即 n2.next = n4

不，等待，按照我的函数，是 node.val = next_node.val, node.next = next_node.next

所以，n3.val = n4.val =9, n3.next = n4.next =None

然后，n2.next 仍然是 n3, 即现在的 n3.val=9, n3.next=None

所以，列表是 n1 ->n2 ->n3, 其中 n1.val=4, n2.val=5, n3.val=9

即 [4,5,9], 正确。

看来我的函数工作正常。

我再考虑一下，如果节点是倒数第二个节点，比如 [1,2,3,4], node=2

n1=1, n2=2, n3=3, n4=4

n1.next=n2, n2.next=n3, n3.next=n4

调用 deleteNode(n2)

n2.val = n3.val =3

n2.next = n3.next =n4

所以，列表变成 n1 ->n2 ->n4, 其中 n1=1, n2=3, n4=4

即 [1,3,4], 正确。

看起来没有问题。

我再看看，如果列表只有两个节点，node是第一个节点。

比如 [1,2], node=1

n1=1, n2=2

n1.next=n2

调用 deleteNode(n1)

n1.val =n2.val=2

n1.next =n2.next=None

所以，列表变成 [2], 正确。

我觉得这个方法很好，简洁且高效。

我再看看是否有优化的空间，或者是否有特殊情况我没有考虑到。

根据问题描述，节点不是尾节点，且列表长度至少为2，所以不需要处理尾节点的情况。

值是唯一的，所以不需要担心值重复。

在代码中，我假设 node 和 node.next 都存在，根据问题描述，这是成立的。

所以，我认为这个解决方案是正确的。

## 最终解决方案
为了删除一个 singly-linked list 中指定的节点，且只能访问该节点，我们可以采用以下方法：

### Approach
1. **Copy Value**: Copy the value of the next node into the current node.
2. **Adjust Pointer**: Set the next pointer of the current node to the next node's next pointer.

这种方法有效地移除了该节点，因为其值被下一个节点的值所替代，然后跳过下一个节点，从而减少了链表中的节点数量。

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize an array `answer` of the same length as `nums` and fill it with 1s. This array will hold the final product values.

2. **Left Products**:
   - We maintain a variable `left` initialized to 1.
   - We iterate through the `nums` array from left to right.
   - For each element, we set `answer[i]` to the current value of `left` and then update `left` by multiplying it with `nums[i]`.

3. **Right Products**:
   - We maintain a variable `right` initialized to 1.
   - We iterate through the `nums` array from right to left.
   - For each element, we multiply `answer[i]` by `right` and then update `right` by multiplying it with `nums[i]`.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to efficiently find the maximum value in each sliding window of size `k` as it moves from the left to the right of the array. A naive approach would be to iterate through each window and find the maximum value, but this would result in a time complexity of O(n*k), which is inefficient for large arrays.

A better approach is to use a double-ended queue (deque) to maintain the indices of useful elements of the current window of size `k`. The deque will store indices of elements in decreasing order such that the front of the deque is always the index of the maximum element in the current window.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create an empty deque `dq` and an empty list `result` to store the maximum values.
   
2. **Processing the First Window**:
   - For the first `k` elements (from index 0 to k-1), iterate through each element:
     - While the deque is not empty and the current element is greater than the element at the index at the rear of the deque, remove the rear index from the deque.
     - Append the current index to the deque.
   
3. **Processing the Rest of the Array**:
   - For the remaining elements from index `k` to `n-1`:
     - Append the front element of the deque (which is the maximum of the previous window) to the `result` list.
     - Remove indices from the front of the deque if they are out of the current window's bounds.
     - While the deque is not empty and the current element is greater than the element at the index at the rear of the deque, remove the rear index from the deque.
     - Append the current index to the deque.
   
4. **Final Step**:
   - After processing all windows, append the front element of the deque (maximum of the last window) to the `result` list.

This approach ensures that we always have the maximum element of the current window at the front of the deque, and it operates in O(n) time complexity because each element is added and removed from the deque at most once.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to efficiently find the maximum value in each sliding window of size `k` as it moves from the left to the right of the array. We will use a double-ended queue (deque) to maintain the indices of useful elements of the current window in decreasing order. This ensures that the front of the deque is always the index of the maximum element in the current window.

     - Append the front element of the deque (maximum of the previous window) to the `result` list.

CoT: Alright, I've got this problem to solve. I need to search for a value in a 2D matrix where each row and each column is sorted in ascending order. The matrix has m rows and n columns, and I need to find out if the target value exists in it.

First, I need to understand the properties of this matrix. Since both rows and columns are sorted in ascending order, that means if I look at any element, all elements to its right are larger, and all elements below it are larger as well.

So, if I start from the top-right corner of the matrix, I can compare the target with the current element.

- If the target is equal to the current element, I've found it and can return True.

- If the target is smaller than the current element, I can move left because all elements to the right will be larger.

- If the target is larger than the current element, I can move down because all elements above will be smaller.

This seems like a good approach because it allows me to eliminate a row or a column in each step.

Let me think about the boundaries:

- If I start from the top-right corner (0, n-1), and if the target is smaller, I decrement the column index.

- If the target is larger, I increment the row index.

- I need to make sure that the row and column indices don't go out of bounds.

Also, I need to consider the case when the matrix is empty or has only one row or one column.

Let me consider some examples to verify my approach.

Example 1:

matrix = [

[1, 4, 7, 11, 15],

[2, 5, 8, 12, 19],

[3, 6, 9, 16, 22],

[10,13,14,17,24],

[18,21,23,26,30]

]

target = 5

Starting from (0,4) which is 15.

5 < 15, so move left to (0,3)=11

5 < 11, move left to (0,2)=7

5 < 7, move left to (0,1)=4

5 > 4, move down to (1,1)=5

5 == 5, return True

Good.

Example 2:

matrix = [

[1,4,7,11,15],

[2,5,8,12,19],

[3,6,9,16,22],

[10,13,14,17,24],

[18,21,23,26,30]

]

target = 20

Starting from (0,4)=15

20 > 15, move down to (1,4)=19

20 > 19, move down to (2,4)=22

20 < 22, move left to (2,3)=16

20 > 16, move down to (3,3)=17

20 > 17, move down to (4,3)=26

20 < 26, move left to (4,2)=23

20 < 23, move left to (4,1)=21

20 < 21, move left to (4,0)=18

20 > 18, move down but row is already at the bottom, so end search, return False

Good, it should return False.

Now, let's think about the time complexity.

In the worst case, I might have to traverse from the top-right to the bottom-left, which would be O(m + n) time, where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.

This is efficient because it's linear in the size of the matrix dimensions.

Space complexity is O(1) since I'm only using a few variables for indices.

Edge cases to consider:

- Matrix is empty: m=0 or n=0, should return False.

- Matrix has only one row: should search linearly in that row.

- Matrix has only one column: should search linearly in that column.

- Target is smaller than the smallest element or larger than the largest element: return False.

- Target exists in the matrix: return True.

- Target does not exist in the matrix: return False.

I need to handle these cases appropriately in the code.

Let me sketch the algorithm step by step:

1. Check if the matrix is empty (m=0 or n=0), return False.

2. Initialize row index to 0 and column index to n-1.

3. While row index is within bounds and column index is within bounds:

a. If matrix[row][col] == target, return True.

b. If matrix[row][col] > target, decrement column index.

c. If matrix[row][col] < target, increment row index.

4. If the loop ends without finding the target, return False.

I need to make sure that the row and column indices don't go out of bounds during the process.

Let me consider an example where the target is not found.

matrix = [

[1,2,3],

[4,5,6],

[7,8,9]

]

target = 10

Start at (0,2)=3

10 > 3, move down to (1,2)=6

10 > 6, move down to (2,2)=9

10 > 9, move down but row index is out of bounds, end search, return False

Good.

Another example where target is smaller than the smallest element.

matrix = [

[1,2,3],

[4,5,6],

[7,8,9]

]

target = 0

Start at (0,2)=3

0 < 3, move left to (0,1)=2

0 < 2, move left to (0,0)=1

0 < 1, move left but column index is out of bounds, end search, return False

Good.

Now, let's think about implementing this in Python.

I need to access matrix[row][col], ensuring that row is between 0 and m-1, and col is between 0 and n-1.

I need to handle the decrement and increment of row and column indices properly.

Let me write a sample code snippet to see.

def searchMatrix(matrix, target):

if not matrix or not matrix[0]:

return False

m = len(matrix)

n = len(matrix[0])

row = 0

col = n - 1

while row < m and col >= 0:

if matrix[row][col] == target:

return True

elif matrix[row][col] > target:

col -= 1

else:

row += 1

return False

Let me test this with the first example.

matrix = [

[1,4,7,11,15],

[2,5,8,12,19],

[3,6,9,16,22],

[10,13,14,17,24],

[18,21,23,26,30]

]

target = 5

row=0, col=4, matrix[0][4]=15 >5 => col=3

row=0, col=3, matrix[0][3]=11 >5 => col=2

row=0, col=2, matrix[0][2]=7 >5 => col=1

row=0, col=1, matrix[0][1]=4 <5 => row=1

row=1, col=1, matrix[1][1]=5 ==5 => return True

Good.

Another test:

target=20

row=0, col=4, 15 <20 => row=1

row=1, col=4, 19 <20 => row=2

row=2, col=4, 22 >20 => col=3

row=2, col=3, 16 <20 => row=3

row=3, col=3, 17 <20 => row=4

row=4, col=3, 26 >20 => col=2

row=4, col=2, 23 >20 => col=1

row=4, col=1, 21 >20 => col=0

row=4, col=0, 18 <20 => row=5, out of bounds => return False

Good.

Seems correct.

Alternative approaches:

- Binary search each row: O(m log n)

- Binary search each column: O(n log m)

- But since m and n can be up to 300, O(m + n) is better than O(m log n)

- Linear search: O(m*n), which is worse.

- Starting from top-right or bottom-left are both acceptable.

I think the current approach is optimal.

I should also consider if there are duplicates in the matrix, but since the problem says each row and column is sorted in ascending order, duplicates might be present, but our algorithm should still work.

Edge cases to code:

- Empty matrix: m=0 or n=0

- Single row matrix

- Single column matrix

- Target smaller than smallest element

- Target larger than largest element

- Target not in matrix

- Target in matrix

I should write test cases for these scenarios to ensure my code works correctly.

In conclusion, the approach is to start from the top-right corner and traverse either left or down based on comparisons with the target value, achieving an efficient O(m + n) time complexity.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to compute all possible results of an arithmetic expression by considering different ways to group numbers and operators. This is a classic problem that can be efficiently solved using recursion and dynamic programming.

### Approach

1. **Divide and Conquer**: The expression can be split at each operator, and the problem can be divided into smaller subproblems.
2. **Recursion**: For each possible split, recursively compute the results of the left and right parts and combine them using the operator.
3. **Memoization**: To optimize, store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

*   `word1 != word2`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest distance between two different words, `word1` and `word2`, in a given array of strings `wordsDict`. The words are guaranteed to exist in the array and are different from each other.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We will track the positions of `word1` and `word2` as we iterate through the array.
   - We will keep two variables, `position1` and `position2`, to store the most recent positions of `word1` and `word2` respectively.
   - We will initialize these positions to -1 since we haven't found any occurrences yet.
   - We will also keep a variable `min_distance` to store the minimum distance found between the two words. We'll initialize it to a large number, such as infinity, to ensure any distance found will be smaller.

2. **Iteration**:
   - We will iterate through the array with a loop, checking each word to see if it matches `word1` or `word2`.
   - When we find a word that matches `word1`, we update `position1` to the current index.
   - Similarly, when we find a word that matches `word2`, we update `position2` to the current index.
   - Every time we update either position, we check if both positions have been set (i.e., both are not -1). If they are, we calculate the absolute difference between them and update `min_distance` if this difference is smaller than the current `min_distance`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After iterating through the entire array, `min_distance` will hold the smallest distance found between `word1` and `word2`.

This approach ensures that we only make a single pass through the array, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to design a data structure that can efficiently answer queries about the shortest distance between two different words in a given array of strings. We'll be implementing a class called `WordDistance` with an initializer that takes a list of strings (`wordsDict`) and a method `shortest` that takes two strings (`word1` and `word2`) and returns the shortest distance between them in the array.

### Approach

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method):**
   - We'll create a hash map (dictionary in Python) where keys are words and values are lists of indices where these words occur in `wordsDict`.
   - This preprocessing step allows us to quickly look up the positions of any word in constant time.

2. **Shortest Distance Query (`shortest` method):**
   - For two given words, retrieve their lists of indices from the hash map.
   - Use two pointers to iterate through these lists to find the minimum absolute difference between any indices of the two words.
   - This method is efficient because it avoids recalculating positions every time a query is made and leverages sorted lists for quick distance computations.

Original Question: Given an array of strings `wordsDict` and two strings that already exist in the array `word1` and `word2`, return _the shortest distance between the occurrence of these two words in the list_.

**Note** that `word1` and `word2` may be the same. It is guaranteed that they represent **two individual words** in the list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** wordsDict = \["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"\], word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** wordsDict = \["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"\], word1 = "makes", word2 = "makes"
**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= wordsDict.length <= 105`
*   `1 <= wordsDict[i].length <= 10`
*   `wordsDict[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
*   `word1` and `word2` are in `wordsDict`.

*   `wordsDict[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
*   `word1` and `word2` are in `wordsDict`.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest distance between two words in an array of strings. The words could be the same or different, and we need to handle both cases efficiently.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We will iterate through the list of words only once.
   - We need to keep track of the most recent positions of `word1` and `word2`.

2. **Tracking Positions**:
   - Maintain two variables, `index1` and `index2`, to store the indices of the most recent occurrences of `word1` and `word2`, respectively.
   - Initialize these variables to -1 since we haven't found any occurrences yet.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - For each word in the list, check if it matches `word1` or `word2`.
   - Update `index1` or `index2` accordingly.
   - Calculate the distance between `index1` and `index2` only if both are not -1.
   - Keep track of the minimum distance found during the iteration.

4. **Handling Identical Words**:
   - If `word1` and `word2` are the same, we need to calculate the distance between the same word's occurrences.
   - In this case, we can treat it similarly but ensure that we are not considering the same index for both words.

Original Question: Given a string `num` which represents an integer, return `true` _if_ `num` _is a **strobogrammatic number**_.

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num =  "88 "

*   `num` does not contain any leading zeros except for zero itself.
Attacked Question: Given a string `num` which represents an integer, return `true` _if_ `num` _is a **strobogrammatic number**_.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num.length <= 50`
*   `num` consists of only digits.
*   `num` does not contain any leading zeros except for zero itself.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number is strobogrammatic, meaning it looks the same when rotated 180 degrees. This involves checking if the number remains the same when flipped upside down, considering that only certain digits (0, 1, 6, 8, 9) look like valid digits when rotated.

### Approach

1. **Mapping of Strobogrammatic Pairs**: 
   - Create a mapping of digits to their rotated counterparts. The pairs are:
     - '0' -> '0'
     - '1' -> '1'
     - '6' -> '9'
     - '8' -> '8'
     - '9' -> '6'
   
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Use two pointers starting from the ends of the string and moving towards the center.
   - At each step, check if the characters at the two pointers form a valid strobogrammatic pair according to the mapping.
   - If they do not form a valid pair, return `false`.
   - Move the pointers towards the center and repeat the check until they meet or cross each other.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Single-digit numbers: Only '0', '1', and '8' are strobogrammatic.
   - Even-length numbers: Need to check all pairs.
   - Odd-length numbers: The middle digit must be '0', '1', or '8'.

    def isStrobogrammatic(self, num: str) -> bool:

Original Question: Given an integer `n`, return all the **strobogrammatic numbers** that are of length `n`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

A **strobogrammatic number** is a number that looks the same when rotated `180` degrees (looked at upside down).

**Output:** \["11","69","88","96"\]

Attacked Question: Given an integer `n`, return all the **strobogrammatic numbers** that are of length `n`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** \["11","69","88","96"\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** \["0","1","8"\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 14`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to generate all strobogrammatic numbers of length `n`. A strobogrammatic number is one that appears the same when rotated 180 degrees. This means that certain digits map to each other under this rotation:

- `0` maps to `0`
- `1` maps to `1`
- `8` maps to `8`
- `6` maps to `9`
- `9` maps to `6`

Digits `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `7` do not have corresponding partners under this rotation and thus cannot be part of a strobogrammatic number.

### Approach

1. **Base Cases:**
   - For `n = 1`, the possible strobogrammatic numbers are `["0", "1", "8"]`.
   - For `n = 2`, they are `["11", "69", "88", "96"]`. Note that "00" is not included because it is not considered a valid two-digit number (leading zeros are not allowed for numbers greater than 1 digit).

2. **General Case for n > 2:**
   - We can build strobogrammatic numbers recursively by adding pairs of strobogrammatic digits to the beginning and end of smaller strobogrammatic numbers.
   - The pairs are `(0,0)`, `(1,1)`, `(6,9)`, `(8,8)`, `(9,6)`.
   - However, for numbers with more than one digit, we cannot have `0` as the first digit.

3. **Recursive Construction:**
   - Start from the base cases and build up to `n` by adding pairs to the smaller strobogrammatic numbers.
   - Ensure that when `n` is even, the number doesn't start with zero unless `n = 1`.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Strobogrammatic Pairs**: The digits that can be used to form strobogrammatic numbers are 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9. However, 6 and 9 are paired because 6 rotates to 9 and vice versa. The digits 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves.

2. **Generating Strobogrammatic Numbers**: We can generate all possible strobogrammatic numbers of a given length and check if they fall within the given range `[low, high]`.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to group strings that can be shifted into each other by shifting each character by a certain number of places in the alphabet. For example, "abc" can be shifted to "bcd" by shifting each character by one place.

### Approach

1. **Normalization**: We need a way to represent each string in a standardized form such that all strings that belong to the same shifting sequence have the same representation.
2. **Hashing**: Use a dictionary to group strings based on their normalized form.

#### Steps

1. **Normalization Function**:
    - For each string, compute the difference between each character and the first character.
    - Use these differences to create a tuple that represents the shifting pattern.
    - This tuple will be used as a key in a dictionary to group the strings.

2. **Grouping**:
    - Iterate through each string in the input list.
    - Normalize each string and add it to the corresponding list in the dictionary.
    - Finally, collect all the lists from the dictionary values.

### Approach

1. **Recursive Function:** We'll use a recursive approach to traverse the tree and check each subtree.
2. **Base Case:** If a node is `None`, it doesn't form a subtree, so we return `True` to indicate that it's a trivial case of a uni-value subtree.
3. **Leaf Nodes:** If a node is a leaf (has no children), it is a uni-value subtree by itself.
4. **Internal Nodes:** For internal nodes, we need to check if both the left and right subtrees are uni-value and if their values match the current node's value.

Attacked Question: Design an iterator to flatten a 2D vector. It should support the `next` and `hasNext` operations.

Implement the `Vector2D` class:

*   `Vector2D(int[][] vec)` initializes the object with the 2D vector `vec`.
*   `next()` returns the next element from the 2D vector and moves the pointer one step forward. You may assume that all the calls to `next` are valid.
*   `hasNext()` returns `true` if there are still some elements in the vector, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

\[\[\[\[1, 2\], \[3\], \[4\]\]\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, 1, 2, 3, true, true, 4, false\]

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to design an iterator that can flatten a 2D vector and support `next()` and `hasNext()` operations efficiently. The challenge here is to handle the 2D structure and provide a seamless iteration experience.

### Approach

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method):**
   - We need to handle the 2D vector efficiently. To do this, we'll use two pointers: one to track the current row (`row_ptr`) and another to track the current column within that row (`col_ptr`).
   - Initialize `row_ptr` to 0 and `col_ptr` to 0.
   - Check if the first row is empty or不存在, and adjust the pointers accordingly to skip empty rows.

2. **Next Element (`next` method):**
   - This method should return the current element and move the pointers to the next element.
   - Return the element at the current `row_ptr` and `col_ptr`.
   - Increment the `col_ptr`.
   - If the next column is out of bounds for the current row, move to the next row by incrementing `row_ptr` and reset `col_ptr` to 0.
   - Skip any empty rows until a valid row is found or all rows are exhausted.

3. **Has Next Element (`hasNext` method):**
   - This method should check if there are more elements left to iterate.
   - It should return True if the `row_ptr` is within the bounds of the vector and the `col_ptr` is within the bounds of the current row.
   - If the current row is empty, it should look ahead to see if there are any non-empty rows beyond the current `row_ptr`.

### Solution Code
Response: python
class Vector2D:
    def __init__(self, vec: List[List[int]]):
        self.vec = vec
        self.row_ptr = 0
        self.col_ptr = 0
        # Move to the first non-empty row
        while self.row_ptr < len(self.vec) and not self.vec[self.row_ptr]:
            self.row_ptr += 1
        if self.row_ptr >= len(self.vec):
            self.row_ptr = -1  # Indicates no more elements

    def next(self) -> int:
        # Get the current element
        val = self.vec[self.row_ptr][self.col_ptr]
        self.col_ptr += 1
        # Move to the next element
        while self.row_ptr < len(self.vec):
            if self.col_ptr < len(self.vec[self.row_ptr]):
                break
            self.row_ptr += 1
            self.col_ptr = 0
            # Skip empty rows
            while self.row_ptr < len(self.vec) and not self.vec[self.row_ptr]:
                self.row_ptr += 1
        if self.row_ptr >= len(self.vec):
            self.row_ptr = -1  # Indicates no more elements
        return val

    def hasNext(self) -> bool:
        return self.row_ptr >= 0 and self.row_ptr < len(self.vec) and self.col_ptr < len(self.vec[self.row_ptr])

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= intervals.length <= 104`

*   `0 <= starti < endi <= 106`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if a person can attend all meetings without any overlaps in their timings. This means that no two meetings should occur at the same time.

2. **Check for Overlaps:**
   - Iterate through the sorted intervals and check if the start time of the current meeting is before the end time of the previous meeting.
   - If any such overlap is found, return `false`.
   - If no overlaps are found after checking all meetings, return `true`.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of conference rooms required to accommodate a given list of meeting time intervals without any overlap in meetings in the same room.

### Approach

1. **Sort the Intervals:**
   - First, sort the meeting intervals based on their start times. This helps in processing meetings in a sequential manner.

2. **Track Meeting Ends:**
   - Use a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the end times of meetings currently happening in the rooms.
   - For each meeting, check if the earliest ending meeting has ended before the new meeting starts.
     - If yes, reuse that room by updating its end time.
     - If not, allocate a new room for the meeting.

3. **Determine the Maximum Number of Rooms Used:**
   - The size of the min-heap at any point represents the number of rooms currently in use.
   - The maximum size of the heap at any point during the processing will be the minimum number of rooms required.

### Solution Code

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 107`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find all possible combinations of factors of a given integer `n` where each factor is within the range [2, n-1]. We will use a backtracking approach to generate these combinations.

### Approach

1. **Backtracking Function**:
   - We define a recursive function that takes parameters: the current product of the combination (`product`), the current combination list (`combination`), and the starting point for the next factor (`start`).
   - If the `product` equals `n`, we have a valid combination and add it to the result list.
   - We iterate from `start` to `n//product` to consider possible factors, ensuring that we don't repeat factors and that factors are in ascending order.

2. **Factor Constraints**:
   - Factors must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than `n`.
   - To avoid duplicates, we ensure that factors are considered in a sorted manner by using a starting point in the iteration.

3. **Termination**:
   - The recursion terminates when the `product` exceeds `n` or when we have considered all possible factors.

### Solution Code

def getFactors(n):
    def factor_combinations(n, product, combination, start, result):

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given sequence is a valid preorder traversal of a binary search tree (BST). In a BST, for any node, all nodes in its left subtree are less than the node, and all nodes in its right subtree are greater than the node.

### Approach

1. **Preorder Traversal Properties**:
   - In a preorder traversal, the sequence is `root, left, right`.
   - For a BST, the root is always greater than all nodes in its left subtree and less than all nodes in its right subtree.

2. **Using a Stack**:
   - We can use a stack to keep track of the nodes as we traverse the sequence.
   - We maintain a variable to represent the root of the current subtree.
   - For each node in the sequence:
     - If the node is less than the root, it should be in the left subtree.
     - If the node is greater than the root, it should be in the right subtree.
     - We need to ensure that once we start traversing the right subtree, we don't encounter any nodes that are less than previous roots.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize an empty stack.
   - Initialize a variable `root` with the minimum possible value.
   - Iterate through each value in the preorder list:
     - If the value is less than `root`, return `False` because it violates the BST property.
     - While the stack is not empty and the current value is greater than the top of the stack, pop the stack and set `root` to the popped value.
     - Push the current value onto the stack.
   - If the entire list is traversed without violations, return `True`.

    stack = []
    root = float('-inf')

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x 3` cost matrix `costs`.

*   For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with the color red; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...

### Approach

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently. The idea is to keep track of the minimum cost of painting each house with each color, considering the constraint that no two adjacent houses can have the same color.

Let's define `dp[i][j]` as the minimum cost to paint house `i` with color `j` (where `j` can be 0 for red, 1 for blue, or 2 for green). For each house `i`, the cost to paint it with color `j` will be the cost of painting it with that color plus the minimum cost of painting the previous house with a different color.

The recurrence relation can be written as:

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find all the paths from the root node to each leaf node in a binary tree. A leaf node is a node that has no children. We will represent each path as a string in the format "root->node->...->leaf".

### Approach

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to traverse from the root to each leaf and collect the path as a string.
2. **Choose a Traversal Method**: A depth-first search (DFS) is suitable for this problem because it allows us to explore each path fully before backtracking.
3. **Build the Path String**: As we traverse down the tree, we will build the path string incrementally. When we reach a leaf node, we will add the complete path to our result list.
4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Consider cases where the tree has only one node or nodes with only one child.

CoT: To solve this problem, we can repeatedly sum the digits of the given number until we are left with a single digit. There are a few ways to approach this:

### Approach 1: Iterative Digit Sum

1. **Initial Check:** If the number is already a single digit (i.e., `num < 10`), return it immediately.
2. **Loop Until Single Digit:** While the number has more than one digit, sum its digits and set the number to this sum.
3. **Return the Result:** Once the number is a single digit, return it.

### Approach 2: Mathematical Insight

There's a mathematical property that can help solve this problem directly without iteration:

- The result of repeatedly summing the digits of a number until a single digit is obtained is equivalent to the number modulo 9, except when the number is a multiple of 9, in which case the result is 9.

            num //= 10

Original Question: Given an array of `n` integers `nums` and an integer `target`, find the number of index triplets `i`, `j`, `k` with `0 <= i < j < k < n` that satisfy the condition `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[-2,0,1,3\], target = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:
\[-2,0,1\]
\[-2,0,3\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[\], target = 0
**Output:** 0

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[0\], target = 0
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `0 <= n <= 3500`
*   `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
*   `-100 <= target <= 100`
Attacked Question: Given an array of `n` integers `nums` and an integer `target`, find the number of index triplets `i`, `j`, `k` with `0 <= i < j < k < n` that satisfy the condition `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target`.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the number of triplets in an array whose sum is less than a given target value. The array can contain up to 3500 elements, so efficiency is crucial.

## Approach

1. **Sorting the Array**: By sorting the array first, we can take advantage of the ordered nature to efficiently find triplets that meet the condition.

2. **Using Two Pointers**: For each fixed first element, we use two pointers (left and right) to find pairs whose sum, when added to the first element, is less than the target.

3. **Counting Valid Triplets**: When we find a valid triplet, we count all possible triplets with the current first element and the range between the two pointers.

## Solution Code

    if len(nums) < 3:

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in **any order**.

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear runtime complexity and uses only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,1,3,2,5\]
**Output:** \[3,5\]
**Explanation: ** \[5, 3\] is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[-1,0\]

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
*   Each integer in `nums` will appear twice, only two integers will appear once.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find two unique numbers in an array where every other number appears exactly twice. We need to achieve this with linear runtime complexity and constant extra space.

### Approach

1. **XOR All Numbers**: 
   - XOR all the numbers in the array. Since XOR of two identical numbers is 0, and XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself, the result will be the XOR of the two unique numbers (let's call them `a` and `b`).

2. **Find a Distinguishing Bit**:
   - Find a bit that is set (1) in the XOR result obtained in the first step. This bit must be different in `a` and `b`.

3. **Divide and Conquer**:
   - Use the distinguishing bit to partition the array into two groups: one group where the bit is set and another where it is not.
   - XOR all numbers in each group separately. Each group will contain one unique number and pairs of identical numbers, so the XOR result of each group will be the unique number in that group.

### Solution Code

def singleNumber(nums):
    # Step 1: XOR all numbers to get XOR of the two unique numbers

    # Step 2: Find a set bit in the xor result
    # Find the rightmost set bit
    set_bit = 1
    while (set_bit & xor) == 0:
        set_bit <<= 1
    
    # Step 3: Divide numbers into two groups and XOR separately
    num1, num2 = 0, 0
    for num in nums:
        if num & set_bit:
            num1 ^= num
        else:
            num2 ^= num
    
    return [num1, num2]

*   `0 <= ai, bi < n`
*   `ai != bi`
*   There are no self-loops or repeated edges.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of edges forms a valid tree structure. A valid tree structure must satisfy two main conditions:

1. **Connectedness:** All nodes are connected, meaning there are no isolated nodes or separate subgraphs.
2. **Acyclicity:** There are no cycles in the graph.

Given that the graph is undirected, we can use either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to check for these conditions. Additionally, Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU) is another efficient approach for this problem.

### Approach

1. **Union-Find (DSU):**
   - Initialize a parent array where each node is its own parent.
   - For each edge, union the two nodes it connects.
   - If during the union operation, we find that two nodes already have the same parent, it means adding this edge would create a cycle.
   - After processing all edges, ensure that all nodes belong to the same component (i.e., they share the same root parent).

2. **DFS:**
   - Build an adjacency list from the edges.
   - Perform a DFS traversal starting from node 0, marking visited nodes.
   - If during DFS we visit a node that has already been visited and it's not the parent of the current node, it indicates a cycle.
   - After DFS, check if all nodes have been visited.

3. **BFS:**
   - Similar to DFS, build an adjacency list.
   - Use a queue to perform BFS starting from node 0, marking visited nodes.
   - If we encounter a node that has already been visited and it's not the parent, it indicates a cycle.
   - After BFS, check if all nodes have been visited.

Among these, Union-Find is often more efficient for this specific problem due to its time complexity and simplicity in detecting cycles and connected components.

### Solution Code
Response: python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = [i for i in range(size)]
        self.rank = [1] * size

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x]!= x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)

Original Question: An **ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, and `5`.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` _if_ `n` _is an **ugly number**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 6
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 6 = 2 \* 3

**Example 2:**

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given integer `n` is an ugly number. An ugly number is defined as a positive integer whose prime factors are only 2, 3, or 5.

### Approach

1. **Handle Special Cases**:
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it cannot be an ugly number since ugly numbers are positive.
   - If `n` is 1, it is considered an ugly number because it has no prime factors.

2. **Factor Out Prime Factors**:
   - Divide `n` by 2 repeatedly until it is no longer divisible by 2.
   - Divide the result by 3 repeatedly until it is no longer divisible by 3.
   - Divide the result by 5 repeatedly until it is no longer divisible by 5.

3. **Check if Reduced to 1**:
   - If after these divisions, `n` is reduced to 1, it means all its prime factors were 2, 3, or 5, hence it is an ugly number.
   - If `n` is not 1 after these steps, it means it had a prime factor other than 2, 3, or 5.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the nth ugly number. Ugly numbers are positive integers whose prime factors are only 2, 3, or 5. The sequence of ugly numbers starts with 1, and then continues with numbers like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, etc.

### Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**:
    - We will use a DP array to store the ugly numbers.
    - We will maintain three pointers (`p2`, `p3`, `p5`) to track the current positions for multiples of 2, 3, and 5 respectively.
    - For each new ugly number, we will choose the smallest number among the current multiples of 2, 3, and 5.
    - We will ensure that we don't repeat numbers by moving the pointers appropriately.

2. **Initialization**:
    - Start with the first ugly number, which is 1.
    - Initialize three pointers `p2`, `p3`, and `p5` to 0, since we start from the first element in the DP array.

3. **Building the DP Array**:
    - For each position `i` from 1 to `n-1`, calculate the next possible multiples:
        - `next_multiple_of_2 = dp[p2] * 2`
        - `next_multiple_of_3 = dp[p3] * 3`
        - `next_multiple_of_5 = dp[p5] * 5`
    - Choose the smallest among these multiples and assign it to `dp[i]`.
    - Move the pointer that produced the smallest multiple.

4. **Return the nth Ugly Number**:
    - The nth ugly number will be at `dp[n-1]`.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x k` cost matrix costs.

*   For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with color `0`; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house `1` with color `2`, and so on...

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum cost to paint all houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color. This is a classic dynamic programming problem where we can build up the solution step by step.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We have `n` houses and `k` colors.
   - We need to keep track of the minimum cost to paint each house with each color, considering the constraint that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - We will use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to paint house `i` with color `j`, given the constraints.
   - Initialize `dp[0][j]` with the cost of painting the first house with color `j`.

3. **State Transition**:
   - For each house `i` from 1 to n-1, and for each color `j` from 0 to k-1:
     - Find the minimum cost from the previous house, but exclude the case where the previous house has the same color `j`.
     - So, `dp[i][j] = costs[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][m] for m in range(k) if m!= j)`

4. **Final Result**:
   - The minimum cost to paint all houses will be the minimum value in the last row of the `dp` table, i.e., `min(dp[n-1])`.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if any permutation of the given string can form a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. For a string to be able to form a palindrome, it must satisfy certain conditions based on the frequencies of its characters.

### Approach

1. **Character Frequency Counting**:
   - We will count the frequency of each character in the string.
   
2. **Conditions for Palindrome**:
   - For a string to form a palindrome:
     - If the string length is even, every character must appear an even number of times.
     - If the string length is odd, exactly one character can appear an odd number of times (this character will be the middle character in the palindrome), and all other characters must appear an even number of times.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each character.
   - Iterate through the frequency counts:
     - Count how many characters have an odd frequency.
   - Check the conditions:
     - If the string length is even, no character should have an odd frequency.
     - If the string length is odd, exactly one character can have an odd frequency.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def canPermutePalindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    from collections import Counter
    freq = Counter(s)
    odd_count = 0

            odd_count += 1
    if len(s) % 2 == 0:
        return odd_count == 0
    else:
        return odd_count == 1

Original Question: Given a string s, return _all the palindromic permutations (without duplicates) of it_.

You may return the answer in **any order**. If `s` has no palindromic permutation, return an empty list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "aabb"
**Output:** \["abba","baab"\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "abc"

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 16`
*   `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

**Constraints:**

*   `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to generate all unique palindromic permutations of a given string `s`. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. For a string to have a palindromic permutation, at most one character can have an odd count (which would be the center character in the palindrome if the length is odd).

### Approach

1. **Count Character Frequencies:** First, count the frequency of each character in the string.
2. **Check for Palindrome Feasibility:** Ensure that at most one character has an odd count.
3. **Generate Halves of the Palindrome:** Create half of the palindrome by using half of each character's frequency (integer division).
4. **Generate Permutations:** Generate all unique permutations of this half.
5. **Construct Palindromes:** For each permutation of the half, construct the full palindrome by appending the reverse of the half to itself, with the odd character in the center if present.

Original Question: Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return _the only number in the range that is missing from the array._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,0,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range \[0,3\]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range \[0,2\]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1\]
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range \[0,9\]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 104`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
*   All the numbers of `nums` are **unique**.

**Follow up:** Could you implement a solution using only `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` runtime complexity?

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the missing number in an array containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`. The array has a length of `n`, and the numbers are distinct, meaning exactly one number in this range is missing.

### Approach

1. **Summation Approach**:
   - The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - By calculating the expected sum for numbers from `0` to `n` and subtracting the actual sum of the numbers in the array, we can find the missing number.

2. **Bit Manipulation Approach**:
   - Using XOR operation, we can find the missing number. XOR of a number with itself is 0, and XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - By XORing all indices and the values at those indices, the result will be the missing number.

Given the constraints, both approaches are valid, but the summation approach is simpler and more straightforward. However, for large values of `n`, the summation might cause integer overflow, although in Python this is not a concern due to its handling of large integers.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def missingNumber(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
    actual_sum = sum(nums)
    return expected_sum - actual_sum

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of letters in an alien language given a list of words that are sorted lexicographically according to the rules of that language. We can model this problem using graph theory and topological sorting.

### Approach

1. **Build the Graph:**
   - Identify the unique characters in all words and create nodes for them in the graph.
   - Determine the edges between nodes by comparing adjacent words in the list. For two words `word1` and `word2`, find the first differing character and add an edge from the character in `word1` to the character in `word2`.

2. **Topological Sort:**
   - Use a topological sort algorithm to order the nodes (characters) based on the edges (dependencies).
   - If a cycle is detected during the topological sort, it means there is no valid order, and we should return an empty string.

3. **Construct the Result:**
   - Collect the characters in the order determined by the topological sort.
   - Ensure that all unique characters are included in the result.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the value in a Binary Search Tree (BST) that is closest to a given target value. If there are multiple values equally close to the target, we should return the smallest one.

### Approach

1. **Understanding BST Properties**: In a BST, for any node:
   - All nodes in the left subtree are less than the node.
   - All nodes in the right subtree are greater than the node.
   
2. **Traversal Strategy**: We can leverage the properties of the BST to efficiently find the closest value without checking every node. Starting from the root, we compare the target with the current node's value and decide whether to go left or right.

3. **Tracking the Closest Value**: As we traverse the tree, we keep track of the node value that is closest to the target. We update this value whenever we find a node that is closer to the target.

4. **Handling Equal Distance**: If two nodes are equally close, we choose the smaller value. This requires us to compare both the distance and the node values.

Original Question: Design an algorithm to encode **a list of strings** to **a string**. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Machine 1 (sender) has the function:

string encode(vector strs) {
  // ... your code
  return encoded\_string;
}

Machine 2 (receiver) has the function:

vector decode(string s) {
  //... your code
  return strs;

So Machine 1 does:

string encoded\_string = encode(strs);

and Machine 2 does:

vector strs2 = decode(encoded\_string);

`strs2` in Machine 2 should be the same as `strs` in Machine 1.

Implement the `encode` and `decode` methods.

**Follow up:** Could you write a generalized algorithm to work on any possible set of characters?
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to design an encoding and decoding mechanism that allows us to transmit a list of strings as a single string and then reconstruct the original list from it. The challenge is to handle any possible ASCII characters, including those that might be used as delimiters.

### Approach

1. **Encoding:**
   - We need a way to separate the strings in the list such that even if the strings contain delimiters, we can still accurately parse them during decoding.
   - One effective way is to use a fixed-length header to prefix each string with its length. This way, the decoder can read the length first and then extract the exact number of characters that make up the string.

2. **Decoding:**
   - Read the length of the first string from the encoded string.
   - Extract the string based on the length.
   - Repeat the process until the entire encoded string is processed.

   - Perform an in-order traversal of the BST to get a sorted list of values. This is because in a BST, an in-order traversal yields values in non-decreasing order.

2. **Find the Closest Values:**
   - Once we have the sorted list, we can find the `k` closest values to the `target` by maintaining a window of size `k` and adjusting it based on the difference between the elements and the `target`.

3. **Two-pointer Technique:**
   - Use a two-pointer technique to maintain a window of size `k` that contains the closest values to the `target`. Start from the position where the `target` would fit in the sorted list and expand the window to include the `k` closest values.

Original Question: Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return _the researcher's h-index_.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** citations = \[3,0,6,1,5\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** \[3,0,6,1,5\] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** citations = \[1,3,1\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `n == citations.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 5000`

**Constraints:**

*   `n == citations.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 5000`
*   `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the h-index for a given array of citations. The h-index is a metric that attempts to measure both the productivity and citation impact of the publications of a scholar. Specifically, a scholar has an h-index equal to `h` if they have published `h` papers each of which has been cited at least `h` times.

### Approach

1. **Sort the Citations:** First, sort the array of citations in descending order. This allows us to easily identify the highest cited papers.
2. **Iterate Through the Sorted Array:** Traverse the sorted array and for each paper at position `i` (0-based index), check if the citation count is at least `i+1`. The h-index is the highest value of `i+1` where this condition holds true.

You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the h-index of a researcher given a sorted array of citations in ascending order. The h-index is defined as the maximum value `h` such that the researcher has at least `h` papers with `h` citations each.

Given that the array is sorted in ascending order, we can utilize a binary search approach to achieve a logarithmic time complexity.

### Approach

1. **Understanding H-Index**:
   - H-index is the maximum value `h` such that the researcher has `h` papers with at least `h` citations each.
   - For a given index `i` in the sorted array, the number of papers with at least `citations[i]` citations is `(n - i)`, where `n` is the total number of papers.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - We use binary search to find the optimal `h`.
   - At each step, calculate the midpoint `mid`.
   - Check if `(n - mid)` papers have at least `citations[mid]` citations.
     - If `citations[mid] <= (n - mid)`, then this could be a potential h-index, but we look for a higher value by searching the right half.
     - If `citations[mid] > (n - mid)`, then the current `h` is too high, and we need to search the left half.

3. **Termination**:
   - The binary search continues until the low pointer exceeds the high pointer.
   - The result is the number of papers `(n - low)` that have at least `(n - low)` citations.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def hIndex(citations):
    n = len(citations)
    low = 0
    high = n - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if citations[mid] <= n - mid - 1:

CoT: I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to paint a fence with `n` posts using `k` different colors, following specific rules. The rules are:

1. Every post must be painted exactly one color.

2. There cannot be three or more consecutive posts with the same color.

I need to find out how many ways I can paint the fence given these constraints.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. For `n` posts and `k` colors, without any restrictions, the total number of ways to paint the fence would be `k^n` because each post can be painted in `k` different ways independently. However, there are restrictions here: no three consecutive posts can have the same color.

So, I need to find the number of ways to paint the fence such that no three consecutive posts have the same color.

I think dynamic programming could be a good approach here because the problem involves making choices for each post based on the previous posts' colors.

Let me try to break it down.

I'll define `dp[i][j]` where `i` is the post number and `j` is the color used for that post. But that might not be efficient, especially since `k` can be up to 10^5.

Wait, `k` can be up to 10^5, and `n` is up to 50. So, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Maybe instead of tracking the color, I can track the number of consecutive posts with the same color.

Let me consider the state of the painting process up to the `i`-th post.

I need to keep track of:

- The color of the `(i-1)`-th post.

- Whether the `i`-th post is the same color as the `(i-1)`-th post.

But that might still be too slow for large `k`.

Another idea: maybe I can keep track of two variables:

- `same`: the number of ways to paint up to the `i`-th post where the `i`-th post has the same color as the `(i-1)`-th post.

- `diff`: the number of ways to paint up to the `i`-th post where the `i`-th post has a different color from the `(i-1)`-th post.

Then, the total ways up to the `i`-th post would be `same + diff`.

Let's see how I can transition between states.

For the first post:

- It can be any of the `k` colors.

- There is no previous post, so `same = 0` and `diff = k`.

Wait, actually, for the first post, since there is no previous post, we can consider `diff = k` and `same = 0`.

For the second post:

- If it's the same color as the first post, then `same = diff` (since the first post is different from nothing, hence `diff = k`).

- If it's different from the first post, then `diff = (diff * (k-1))` because we can choose any of the `k-1` other colors.

Wait, let me think again.

Actually, for the second post:

- If it's the same color as the first post, then `same = diff_prev` because the previous post was different, so we can choose the same color.

- If it's different from the first post, then `diff = (same_prev + diff_prev) * (k-1)` because we can choose any of the `k-1` colors different from the previous post's color.

But we need to make sure that no three consecutive posts have the same color.

Wait, maybe I need to track the number of ways where the last two posts have the same color and where they are different.

Let me define:

- `same[i]`: number of ways to paint up to the `i`-th post where the `(i-1)`-th and `i`-th posts have the same color.

- `diff[i]`: number of ways to paint up to the `i`-th post where the `(i-1)`-th and `i`-th posts have different colors.

Then, the total ways up to the `i`-th post is `same[i] + diff[i]`.

Now, for the transitions:

- To have `same[i]`, the `(i-1)`-th and `i`-th posts must have the same color, but the `(i-2)`-th post must have a different color (to avoid three consecutive same colors). So, `same[i] = diff[i-1]`.

- To have `diff[i]`, we can choose any color different from the `(i-1)`-th post's color, regardless of the previous posts. So, `diff[i] = (same[i-1] + diff[i-1]) * (k-1)`.

Wait, but in `diff[i]`, we need to ensure that the `i`-th post is different from the `(i-1)`-th post.

Yes, that seems correct.

Let's verify this with the example given.

Example 1:

n = 3, k = 2

So, posts: 1, 2, 3

Colors: say, red and green.

Initialize:

- For post 1:

- same[1] = 0 (no previous post)

- diff[1] = k = 2 (can be red or green)

- Total ways up to post 1: 2

For post 2:

- same[2] = diff[1] = 2

- diff[2] = (same[1] + diff[1]) * (k-1) = (0 + 2) * 1 = 2

- Total ways up to post 2: 2 + 2 = 4

For post 3:

- same[3] = diff[2] = 2

- diff[3] = (same[2] + diff[2]) * (k-1) = (2 + 2) * 1 = 4

- Total ways up to post 3: 2 + 4 = 6

Which matches the example output of 6.

Good, seems correct.

Let's check another example.

Example 2:

n = 1, k = 1

Posts: 1

Colors: only 1 color.

same[1] = 0

diff[1] = 1

Total ways: 1

Which matches the output.

Example 3:

n = 7, k = 2

Let's compute:

Post 1:

same[1] = 0

diff[1] = 2

Total: 2

Post 2:

same[2] = diff[1] = 2

diff[2] = (0 + 2) * 1 = 2

Total: 4

Post 3:

same[3] = diff[2] = 2

diff[3] = (2 + 2) * 1 = 4

Total: 6

Post 4:

same[4] = diff[3] = 4

diff[4] = (2 + 4) * 1 = 6

Total: 10

Post 5:

same[5] = diff[4] = 6

diff[5] = (4 + 6) * 1 = 10

Total: 16

Post 6:

same[6] = diff[5] = 10

diff[6] = (6 + 10) * 1 = 16

Total: 26

Post 7:

same[7] = diff[6] = 16

diff[7] = (10 + 16) * 1 = 26

Total: 42

Which matches the example output of 42.

Great, seems correct.

Now, let's think about the base cases.

For n = 1:

same[1] = 0

diff[1] = k

total = k

For n = 2:

same[2] = diff[1] = k

diff[2] = (same[1] + diff[1]) * (k - 1) = (0 + k) * (k - 1) = k*(k-1)

total = k + k*(k-1) = k + k^2 - k = k^2

Which makes sense.

For n = 3:

same[3] = diff[2] = k*(k-1)

diff[3] = (same[2] + diff[2])*(k-1) = (k + k*(k-1))*(k-1) = (k + k^2 - k)*(k-1) = k^2*(k-1)

total = k*(k-1) + k^2*(k-1) = k*(k-1)*(1 + k) = k*(k-1)*(k+1)

For k=2, n=3: 2*1*3 = 6, which matches example 1.

For k=2, n=7: total is 42, as in example 3.

Looks good.

Now, I need to implement this in code.

Since n can be up to 50 and k up to 1e5, I need an efficient solution.

Using the above dp approach, I can compute the total ways in O(n) time, which is acceptable since n is small (<=50).

I can use two variables to keep track of same and diff, updating them iteratively from post 1 to post n.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Initialize same = 0, diff = k for post 1.

2. For each post from 2 to n:

a. new_same = diff

b. new_diff = (same + diff) * (k - 1)

c. Update same and diff with new_same and new_diff

3. After processing post n, the total ways are same + diff.

I need to make sure that I handle the case when k = 1.

If k = 1:

- For n = 1: 1 way

- For n = 2: same[2] = diff[1] = 1

diff[2] = (same[1] + diff[1]) * 0 = 0

total = 1 + 0 = 1

- For n = 3: same[3] = diff[2] = 0

diff[3] = (same[2] + diff[2]) * 0 = 0

total = 0 + 0 = 0

Which makes sense because with k=1, you can't have three consecutive posts with the same color, but since there's only one color, it's impossible for n=3.

Wait, but according to the constraints, the test cases are generated such that the answer is within [0, 2^31 - 1], so I don't need to worry about overflow.

Given that k can be up to 1e5 and n up to 50, the total can be up to 50 * 1e5 = 5e6, which is fine for int in Python.

I should also consider the case when n=0, but according to the constraints, n >=1.

Wait, in the problem statement, n is from 1 to 50.

So, I don't need to handle n=0.

Let me write a small function to compute this.

def numWays(n, k):

if n == 0:

return 0

same, diff = 0, k

for i in range(2, n+1):

new_same = diff

new_diff = (same + diff) * (k - 1)

same, diff = new_same, new_diff

return same + diff

But according to the above, for n=1, same=0, diff=k, total=k, which is correct.

For n=2, same=diff=1, diff=K*(K-1), total=K + K*(K-1) = K^2.

Correct.

I think this should work.

Let me test it with the examples.

Test case 1:

n=3, k=2

same=2, diff=4, total=6. Correct.

Test case 2:

n=1, k=1

same=0, diff=1, total=1. Correct.

Test case 3:

n=7, k=2

same=16, diff=26, total=42. Correct.

Looks good.

I think this is a solid solution.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to paint a fence with `n` posts using `k` different colors, adhering to the rule that no three or more consecutive posts can have the same color.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - For the first post, there are no restrictions, so it can be painted in any of the `k` colors.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming States**:
   - `same`: Number of ways to paint up to the current post such that the current post has the same color as the previous post.
   - `diff`: Number of ways to paint up to the current post such that the current post has a different color from the previous post.
   
3. **Transitions**:
   - To have `same[i]`, the `i`-th post must have the same color as the `(i-1)`-th post, but the `(i-2)`-th post must differ to avoid three consecutive same colors. Hence, `same[i] = diff[i-1]`.
   - To have `diff[i]`, the `i`-th post must have a different color from the `(i-1)`-th post. This can be achieved by choosing any of the `(k-1)` colors different from the previous post's color. Hence, `diff[i] = (same[i-1] + diff[i-1]) * (k - 1)`.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The total number of ways to paint `n` posts is the sum of `same[n]` and `diff[n]`.

Original Question: Suppose you are at a party with `n` people labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other `n - 1` people know the celebrity, but the celebrity does not know any of them.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. You are only allowed to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B? " to get information about whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given a helper function `bool knows(a, b)` that tells you whether `a` knows `b`. Implement a function `int findCelebrity(n)`. There will be exactly one celebrity if they are at the party.

Return _the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity at the party_. If there is no celebrity, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[1,1,0\],\[0,1,0\],\[1,1,1\]\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph\[i\]\[j\] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph\[i\]\[j\] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[1,0,1\],\[1,1,0\],\[0,1,1\]\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There is no celebrity.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == graph.length == graph[i].length`
*   `2 <= n <= 100`
*   `graph[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
*   `graph[i][i] == 1`

**Follow up:** If the maximum number of allowed calls to the API `knows` is `3 * n`, could you find a solution without exceeding the maximum number of calls?

**Follow up:** If the maximum number of allowed calls to the API `knows` is `3 * n`, could you find a solution without exceeding the maximum number of calls?
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find a celebrity in a party of `n` people, where a celebrity is defined as someone who is known by everyone else but knows no one. We are given a helper function `knows(a, b)` that returns `True` if person `a` knows person `b`, and `False` otherwise. Our task is to implement a function `findCelebrity(n)` that identifies the celebrity or returns `-1` if no celebrity exists.

### Approach

1. **Initial Consideration**:
   - A brute-force approach would involve checking for each person whether they are known by all others and know no one. This would require `O(n^2)` calls to `knows`, which is inefficient.
   
2. **Optimized Approach**:
   - Use two passes to reduce the number of calls to `knows`.
   - **First Pass**: Use a candidate variable to keep track of the potential celebrity. Iterate through the people, and for each person, if the candidate knows the current person, set the candidate to the current person. This is because if the candidate knows someone, they cannot be a celebrity.
   - **Second Pass**: Verify if the candidate is indeed a celebrity by checking two conditions:
     - The candidate does not know any other person.
     - Every other person knows the candidate.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The first pass reduces the number of candidates to one potential celebrity.
   - The second pass verifies the candidate with `2n` calls to `knows`.
   - Overall, this approach uses `3n` calls to `knows`, which meets the follow-up constraint of maximum `3n` calls.

Original Question: You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, bad = 4
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:**
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.

**Example 2:**

*   `1 <= bad <= n <= 231 - 1`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the first bad version among `n` versions, where all versions after the first bad one are also bad. We are given an API `isBadVersion(version)` that returns whether a given version is bad. Our goal is to minimize the number of calls to this API.

### Approach

1. **Binary Search Intuition**:
   - Since the versions are ordered and all versions after the first bad one are bad, we can use binary search to efficiently find the first bad version.
   - We start by considering the range from version 1 to version n.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` at 1 and `right` at n.
   - While `left` is less than `right`, find the middle version `mid`.
   - If `isBadVersion(mid)` is true, it means the first bad version is either `mid` or earlier, so we update `right` to `mid`.
   - If `isBadVersion(mid)` is false, the first bad version must be after `mid`, so we update `left` to `mid + 1`.
   - The process continues until `left` equals `right`, at which point `left` will be the first bad version.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is 1, it is the only version and hence the first bad version if `isBadVersion(1)` is true.
   - If all versions are good, the problem constraints ensure that there is at least one bad version, so this case is not possible given the constraints.

Original Question: Given an integer `n`, return _the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to_ `n`.

A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, `1`, `4`, `9`, and `16` are perfect squares while `3` and `11` are not.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 12

**Input:** n = 13
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 13 = 4 + 9.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 104`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a method called the "BFS" (Breadth-First Search) approach. It's like exploring a maze where each step leads us closer to the solution.

First, we need to understand what perfect squares are. Perfect squares are numbers like 1, 4, 9, 16, etc., which are squares of integers (1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, etc.).

Our goal is to find the least number of these perfect squares that add up to a given number `n`.

Here's how we can think about it:

1. **Start with 0:** We consider 0 as the starting point.

2. **Levels in BFS:** Each level in our search represents the number of perfect squares used. So, level 1 would be all perfect squares less than or equal to `n`, level 2 would be all sums of two perfect squares, and so on.

3. **Visited Array:** We keep track of the numbers we've already considered to avoid redundant calculations.

4. **Queue:** We use a queue to keep track of the numbers we need to explore next.

Let's break down the steps with an example where `n = 12`.

- **Step 1:** Start with 0.

- **Step 2:** From 0, we can add any perfect square less than or equal to 12. So, we add 1, 4, 9 to the queue. Now, the queue has [1, 4, 9], and we mark these as visited.

- **Step 3:** Dequeue 1. From 1, we can add perfect squares again, but we have to make sure not to exceed 12 and not to revisit numbers we've already seen.

- **Step 4:** Continue this process until we reach 12.

But actually, in the code provided, it's a bit optimized. It considers the difference between `n` and the perfect squares, which leads us closer to 0.

Let me explain the code step by step:
Response: python
import math
from typing import List

    def numSquares(self, n: int) -> int:
        square_nums = [i**2 for i in range(0, int(math.sqrt(n))+1)]

**Follow up:** Could you solve the problem in `O(n)` time complexity?
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to reorder the array such that `nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3]...`. This pattern is known as a "wiggle sort," where elements toggle between being less than or equal to and greater than or equal to their adjacent elements.

### Approach

1. **Sorting and Swapping:**
   - One straightforward way is to sort the array and then swap every pair of adjacent elements starting from the second element.
   - However, this approach doesn't always produce the correct result because simply swapping adjacent elements in a sorted array might not satisfy the wiggle condition for all elements.

2. **In-Place Wiggle Adjustment:**
   - A better approach is to iterate through the array and ensure that every pair of adjacent elements satisfies the wiggle condition.
   - Specifically, for every even index `i`, ensure `nums[i] <= nums[i+1]`, and for every odd index `i`, ensure `nums[i] >= nums[i+1]`.
   - If the condition is not met, swap `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]`.

This approach ensures that the wiggle condition is met without requiring additional space beyond a few variables, making it efficient in terms of space.

    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):

Original Question: Given two vectors of integers `v1` and `v2`, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

Implement the `ZigzagIterator` class:

*   `ZigzagIterator(List v1, List v2)` initializes the object with the two vectors `v1` and `v2`.
*   `boolean hasNext()` returns `true` if the iterator still has elements, and `false` otherwise.
*   `int next()` returns the current element of the iterator and moves the iterator to the next element.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1,2\], v2 = \[3,4,5,6\]
**Output:** \[1,3,2,4,5,6\]
**Explanation:** By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: \[1,3,2,4,5,6\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1\], v2 = \[\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** v1 = \[\], v2 = \[1\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= v1.length, v2.length <= 1000`

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to implement an iterator that alternates between the elements of two given vectors. The iterator should support the `next` and `hasNext` operations.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**: 
   - We will maintain two pointers, one for each vector, to track the current position in each vector.
   - We will also maintain a flag to alternate between the vectors.

2. **hasNext**:
   - This method should check if there are any elements left in either of the vectors.
   - It can do this by checking if either pointer is within the bounds of its respective vector.

3. **next**:
   - This method should return the next element in the zigzag order.
   - It should alternate between the two vectors, moving the respective pointer forward each time an element is returned.
   - If one vector is exhausted before the other, it should continue returning elements from the non-exhausted vector.

**Input:** num =  "3456237490 ", target = 9191
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** There are no expressions that can be created from  "3456237490 " to evaluate to 9191.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num.length <= 10`
*   `num` consists of only digits.
*   `-231 <= target <= 231 - 1`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to insert binary operators ('+', '-', '*') between the digits of a given string `num` such that the resulting expression evaluates to a given `target` value. The operands should not contain leading zeros.

### Approach

1. **Backtracking**: We will use a backtracking approach to try all possible combinations of operators between the digits.
2. **Operator Precedence**: Since multiplication has higher precedence than addition and subtraction, we need to handle it carefully. We will keep track of the partial results and the last operand to handle the multiplication correctly.
3. **Avoid Leading Zeros**: We need to ensure that no operand has leading zeros, except for the number '0' itself.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def addOperators(num: str, target: int):
    def backtrack(index, path, value, prev):
        # If we have reached the end of the number and the current value equals the target
        if index == len(num) and value == target:
            result.append(path)
            return
        for i in range(index, len(num)):
            # Skip leading zeros
            if i > index and num[index] == '0':
                break
            operand = int(num[index:i+1])
            if index == 0:
                # Start of the expression
                backtrack(i+1, path + str(operand), operand, operand)
            else:
                # Add +
                backtrack(i+1, path + '+' + str(operand), value + operand, operand)
                # Add -
                backtrack(i+1, path + '-' + str(operand), value - operand, -operand)
                # Add *
                # For multiplication, we need to adjust the value by subtracting the previous operand and then adding the product
                backtrack(i+1, path + '*' + str(operand), value - prev + prev * operand, prev * operand)
    
    result = []
    if num:
        backtrack(0, "", 0, 0)
    return result

# Example usage:
print(addOperators("123", 6))  # Output: ["1*2*3", "1+2+3"]
print(addOperators("232", 8))  # Output: ["2*3+2", "2+3*2"]

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to move all zeros in the array to the end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. We must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

### Approach

1. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, starting from the beginning of the array.
   - The `right` pointer iterates through the array, and when it finds a non-zero element, it swaps it with the element at the `left` pointer and increments the `left` pointer.
   - This way, all non-zero elements are moved to the front of the array in their original order, and the zeros are pushed to the end.

2. **In-Place Modification**:
   - We modify the array directly without using extra space, ensuring that the operations are efficient in terms of space.

    left = 0

Original Question: Design an iterator that supports the `peek` operation on an existing iterator in addition to the `hasNext` and the `next` operations.

Implement the `PeekingIterator` class:

*   `PeekingIterator(Iterator nums)` Initializes the object with the given integer iterator `iterator`.
*   `int next()` Returns the next element in the array and moves the pointer to the next element.
*   `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there are still elements in the array.
*   `int peek()` Returns the next element in the array **without** moving the pointer.

**Note:** Each language may have a different implementation of the constructor and `Iterator`, but they all support the `int next()` and `boolean hasNext()` functions.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "PeekingIterator ",  "next ",  "peek ",  "next ",  "next ",  "hasNext "\]
\[\[\[1, 2, 3\]\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, 1, 2, 2, 3, false\]

**Explanation**
PeekingIterator peekingIterator = new PeekingIterator(\[1, 2, 3\]); // \[**1**,2,3\]
peekingIterator.next();    // return 1, the pointer moves to the next element \[1,**2**,3\].
peekingIterator.peek();    // return 2, the pointer does not move \[1,**2**,3\].
peekingIterator.next();    // return 2, the pointer moves to the next element \[1,2,**3**\]
peekingIterator.next();    // return 3, the pointer moves to the next element \[1,2,3\]
peekingIterator.hasNext(); // return False

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
*   All the calls to `next` and `peek` are valid.
*   At most `1000` calls will be made to `next`, `hasNext`, and `peek`.

**Follow up:** How would you extend your design to be generic and work with all types, not just integer?

**Follow up:** How would you extend your design to be generic and work with all types, not just integer?
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to design a `PeekingIterator` class that adds a `peek` functionality to an existing iterator. The `peek` operation should allow us to look at the next element without advancing the iterator.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We will store the underlying iterator.
   - We will maintain a variable to cache the next value from the iterator.

2. **next()**:
   - Return the cached next value and fetch the next value from the iterator.

3. **hasNext()**:
   - Check if the cached next value is present.

4. **peek()**:
   - Return the cached next value without fetching the next one.

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary search tree and a node `p` in it, return _the in-order successor of that node in the BST_. If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return `null`.

The successor of a node `p` is the node with the smallest key greater than `p.val`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[2,1,3\], p = 1
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.

**Output:** null
**Explanation:** There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is `null`.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
*   `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the in-order successor of a given node in a Binary Search Tree (BST). The in-order successor of a node is the node with the smallest key greater than the node's value. If no such node exists, we should return `null`.

### Approach

1. **Understanding In-Order Traversal**: In an in-order traversal of a BST, nodes are visited in ascending order. So, the in-order successor of a node is the next node in this sequence.

2. **Case 1: Node has a right child**: If the node has a right child, the in-order successor is the leftmost node in its right subtree.

3. **Case 2: Node does not have a right child**: If the node does not have a right child, we need to traverse up the tree to find the nearest ancestor for which the given node is in its left subtree.

4. **Edge Cases**: If the node is the rightmost node in the tree, it will not have an in-order successor, so we return `null`.

Original Question: You are given an `m x n` grid `rooms` initialized with these three possible values.

*   `-1` A wall or an obstacle.
*   `0` A gate.
*   `INF` Infinity means an empty room. We use the value `231 - 1 = 2147483647` to represent `INF` as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than `2147483647`.

Fill each empty room with the distance to _its nearest gate_. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with `INF`.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to fill each empty room in a grid with the distance to its nearest gate. We can achieve this using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, starting from all gates simultaneously.

### Approach

1. **Identify Gates:** First, we identify all the gates in the grid. Gates are cells with a value of 0.
2. **BFS from Gates:** We perform a BFS starting from these gates. In each step of the BFS, we explore cells that are adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the current cell and are empty rooms (value is INF).

**Follow up:**

*   How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
*   Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?
CoT: So I've got this problem here. I have an array of integers called `nums`, and it contains `n + 1` integers. Each of these integers is between 1 and `n` inclusive. The key point is that there's only one repeated number in this array, and I need to find it. The tricky part is that I have to do this without modifying the array and using only constant extra space. That means I can't sort the array or use additional data structures like hash sets, at least not in a way that increases my space usage beyond constant.

First, I need to understand why there must be a duplicate. Well, since there are `n + 1` numbers and each number is between 1 and `n`, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one number must be repeated. It's like trying to fit `n + 1` pigeons into `n` holes; at least one hole must contain more than one pigeon.

Now, how do I find this duplicate without using extra space or modifying the array? One approach that comes to mind is treating the array as a linked list where the value at each index points to the next node. For example, if `nums[i] = x`, then x is the next node to visit. Since there's a duplicate, there will be a cycle in this linked list, and the duplicate number is the entrance to the cycle.

This sounds a lot like the "linked list cycle II" problem, where we need to find the starting point of the cycle. Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm can be used here. The idea is to have two pointers, a slow one and a fast one. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. If there's a cycle, they will meet at some point within the cycle.

Once they meet, I can reset one of the pointers to the start and then move both pointers at the same pace. The point at which they meet again will be the entrance to the cycle, which corresponds to the duplicate number.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Initialize two pointers, `tortoise` and `hare`, both starting at the first element of the array.

2. Move `tortoise` one step and `hare` two steps at a time through the array, using the values as indices.

3. When `tortoise` and `hare` meet, reset `tortoise` to the start of the array.

4. Move both `tortoise` and `hare` one step at a time until they meet again. The meeting point is the duplicate number.

Let me consider the first example:

nums = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]

Index: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

Values:1,3,4,2,2

So, starting with both tortoise and hare at index 0:

- tortoise: nums[0] = 1

- hare: nums[nums[0]] = nums[1] = 3

Next step:

- tortoise: nums[1] = 3

- hare: nums[nums[3]] = nums[2] = 4

Next:

- tortoise: nums[3] = 2

- hare: nums[nums[4]] = nums[2] = 4

Now, tortoise is at 2 and hare is at 4. Next:

- tortoise: nums[2] = 4

- hare: nums[nums[4]] = nums[2] = 4

Now, both are at 4, so they meet at index 4.

Now, reset tortoise to index 0, which is 1.

Move both one step at a time:

- tortoise: nums[0] = 1

- hare: nums[4] = 2

Not the same.

Next:

- tortoise: nums[1] = 3

- hare: nums[2] = 4

Not the same.

Next:

- tortoise: nums[3] = 2

- hare: nums[4] = 2

They meet at 2, which is the duplicate.

Looks good.

Let's consider the second example:

nums = [3,1,3,4,2]

Index: 0,1,2,3,4

Values:3,1,3,4,2

Start with both at index 0:

- tortoise: nums[0] = 3

- hare: nums[nums[0]] = nums[3] = 4

Next:

- tortoise: nums[3] = 4

- hare: nums[nums[4]] = nums[2] = 3

Next:

- tortoise: nums[4] = 2

- hare: nums[nums[2]] = nums[3] = 4

Now, tortoise is at 2 and hare is at 4.

Next:

- tortoise: nums[2] = 3

- hare: nums[nums[4]] = nums[2] = 3

They meet at 3.

Reset tortoise to index 0, which is 3.

Move both one step at a time:

- tortoise: nums[0] = 3

- hare: nums[3] = 4

Not the same.

Next:

- tortoise: nums[3] = 4

- hare: nums[4] = 2

Not the same.

Next:

- tortoise: nums[4] = 2

- hare: nums[2] = 3

Not the same.

Next:

- tortoise: nums[2] = 3

- hare: nums[3] = 4

Not the same.

Next:

- tortoise: nums[3] = 4

- hare: nums[4] = 2

Not the same.

This seems like an infinite loop. Wait, maybe I messed up the steps.

Wait, in the first phase, I need to continue moving tortoise one step and hare two steps until they meet.

In this case:

Start at index 0:

tortoise: 3, hare: 4

tortoise: 4, hare: 2

tortoise: 2, hare: 3

tortoise: 3, hare: 4

tortoise: 4, hare: 2

tortoise: 2, hare: 3

They keep cycling without meeting. Hmm, maybe I need to check for equality at each step.

Wait, let's re-examine the algorithm.

In Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm, the meeting point is not necessarily at the start of the cycle. To find the entrance to the cycle, which is the duplicate number, I need to perform the second phase after they meet.

In the second phase, I reset one pointer to the start and move both pointers one step at a time until they meet again. The meeting point should be the entrance to the cycle.

In the second example, let's see:

Start at index 0:

tortoise: 3, hare: 4

tortoise: 4, hare: 2

tortoise: 2, hare: 3

tortoise: 3, hare: 4

tortoise: 4, hare: 2

tortoise: 2, hare: 3

They keep alternating between these values without meeting. Maybe I need to check for equality at each step.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the cycle might not be formed in the way I think. Let's try to map out the links:

Index: 0,1,2,3,4

Values:3,1,3,4,2

So, starting from index 0, value 3, go to index 3, value 4, go to index 4, value 2, go to index 2, value 3, go to index 3, value 4, and so on. So the cycle is 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3.

The duplicate number is 3, which is where the cycle starts.

Wait, but in this case, when I have tortoise at 3 and hare at 4, then tortoise moves to 4 and hare to 2, then tortoise to 2 and hare to 3, then tortoise to 3 and hare to 4, and so on. They never meet.

This suggests that perhaps Floyd's algorithm isn't directly applicable here, or maybe I'm misapplying it.

Wait, perhaps I need to use the values as indices directly. Let's try again.

Initialize tortoise and hare to nums[0] = 3.

First step:

tortoise = nums[3] = 4

hare = nums[nums[3]] = nums[4] = 2

Second step:

tortoise = nums[4] = 2

hare = nums[nums[2]] = nums[3] = 4

Now, tortoise is at 2 and hare is at 4.

Third step:

tortoise = nums[2] = 3

hare = nums[nums[4]] = nums[2] = 3

Now, they meet at 3.

Reset tortoise to nums[0] = 3.

Move both one step at a time:

tortoise = nums[3] = 4

hare = nums[3] = 4

They meet at 4, but the duplicate is 3.

Hmm, that's not correct. Maybe I need to adjust the algorithm.

Wait, perhaps the issue is in the second phase. Let's look up the correct steps for Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm in this context.

Upon reviewing, the algorithm is:

1. Initialize both tortoise and hare to the first element.

2. Move tortoise one step and hare two steps until they meet.

3. Once they meet, reset tortoise to the first element.

4. Move both tortoise and hare one step at a time until they meet again. The meeting point is the entrance to the cycle.

In the second example:

nums = [3,1,3,4,2]

Index: 0,1,2,3,4

Values:3,1,3,4,2

Start both at index 0, value 3.

First step:

tortoise = nums[0] = 3

hare = nums[nums[0]] = nums[3] = 4

Second step:

tortoise = nums[3] = 4

hare = nums[nums[4]] = nums[2] = 3

Third step:

tortoise = nums[4] = 2

hare = nums[nums[2]] = nums[3] = 4

Fourth step:

tortoise = nums[2] = 3

hare = nums[nums[4]] = nums[2] = 3

Now, they meet at 3.

Reset tortoise to nums[0] = 3.

Move both one step at a time:

tortoise = nums[3] = 4

hare = nums[3] = 4

They meet at 4, but the duplicate is 3.

This suggests that the algorithm isn't working as expected in this case. Maybe I need to adjust how I'm interpreting the indices.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the array values as pointers to indices. So, if the value is 3, it points to index 3.

Let me try that.

In the second example:

nums = [3,1,3,4,2]

Index: 0,1,2,3,4

Values:3,1,3,4,2

So, the links are:

0 -> 3

3 -> 4

4 -> 2

2 -> 3 (cycle starts here)

So, the cycle is 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3

The entrance to the cycle is 3, which is the duplicate number.

In this case, using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm should work.

Let me try again.

Initialize tortoise and hare to index 0, value 3.

First step:

tortoise = nums[0] = 3

hare = nums[nums[0]] = nums[3] = 4

Second step:

tortoise = nums[3] = 4

hare = nums[nums[4]] = nums[2] = 3

Third step:

tortoise = nums[4] = 2

hare = nums[nums[2]] = nums[3] = 4

Fourth step:

tortoise = nums[2] = 3

hare = nums[nums[4]] = nums[2] = 3

Now, they meet at 3.

Reset tortoise to index 0, which is 3.

Move both one step at a time:

tortoise = nums[0] = 3

hare = nums[3] = 4

Not the same.

Next:

tortoise = nums[3] = 4

hare = nums[4] = 2

Not the same.

Next:

tortoise = nums[4] = 2

hare = nums[2] = 3

Not the same.

Next:

tortoise = nums[2] = 3

hare = nums[3] = 4

Not the same.

Next:

tortoise = nums[3] = 4

hare = nums[4] = 2

This seems like an infinite loop. I must be misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the reset should be to the start of the array, which is index 0, but use the value there, which is 3.

Wait, maybe I need to reset tortoise to the starting point, which is index 0, and then move it step by step using the array values.

Wait, let's look up the correct implementation of Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm for cycle detection in arrays.

Upon reviewing, the algorithm is:

1. Initialize both tortoise and hare to nums[0].

2. In the first phase, move tortoise one step and hare two steps until they meet.

3. In the second phase, reset tortoise to nums[0], and move both tortoise and hare one step at a time until they meet again. The meeting point is the duplicate number.

In the second example, following these steps:

nums = [3,1,3,4,2]

First phase:

tortoise = 3, hare = nums[nums[0]] = nums[3] = 4

tortoise = nums[3] = 4, hare = nums[nums[4]] = nums[2] = 3

tortoise = nums[4] = 2, hare = nums[nums[2]] = nums[3] = 4

tortoise = nums[2] = 3, hare = nums[nums[4]] = nums[2] = 3

They meet at 3.

Second phase:

reset tortoise to nums[0] = 3

Move both one step at a time:

tortoise = nums[3] = 4, hare = nums[3] = 4 → not the same

tortoise = nums[4] = 2, hare = nums[4] = 2 → not the same

tortoise = nums[2] = 3, hare = nums[2] = 3 → meet at 3

So, in this case, they meet at 3, which is the duplicate.

Wait, in my earlier attempt, I thought they wouldn't meet at the duplicate, but actually, in this step-by-step, they do meet at 3.

Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me try again.

Second phase:

tortoise = 3, hare = 3 → meet at 3

So, the duplicate is 3.

Alright, seems like it works.

Let me try another example to verify.

Suppose nums = [1,2,2,3,4]

Index: 0,1,2,3,4

Values:1,2,2,3,4

First phase:

tortoise = 1, hare = nums[nums[0]] = nums[1] = 2

tortoise = nums[1] = 2, hare = nums[nums[1]] = nums[2] = 2

They meet at 2.

Second phase:

reset tortoise to nums[0] = 1

Move both one step at a time:

tortoise = nums[1] = 2, hare = nums[2] = 2 → meet at 2

So, the duplicate is 2.

Looks correct.

Another example: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]

Index:0,1,2,3,4

Values:2,2,2,2,2

First phase:

tortoise = 2, hare = nums[nums[0]] = nums[2] = 2

They meet at 2.

Second phase:

reset tortoise to nums[0] = 2

Move both one step at a time:

tortoise = nums[2] = 2, hare = nums[2] = 2 → meet at 2

Duplicate is 2.

Correct.

One more example: nums = [4,1,3,4,2]

Index:0,1,2,3,4

Values:4,1,3,4,2

First phase:

tortoise = 4, hare = nums[nums[0]] = nums[4] = 2

tortoise = nums[4] = 2, hare = nums[nums[2]] = nums[3] = 4

tortoise = nums[2] = 3, hare = nums[nums[4]] = nums[2] = 3

tortoise = nums[3] = 4, hare = nums[nums[2]] = nums[3] = 4

They meet at 4.

Second phase:

reset tortoise to nums[0] = 4

Move both one step at a time:

tortoise = nums[4] = 2, hare = nums[4] = 2 → not the same

tortoise = nums[2] = 3, hare = nums[2] = 3 → not the same

tortoise = nums[3] = 4, hare = nums[3] = 4 → meet at 4

So, duplicate is 4.

But in this array, 4 appears twice, so it's correct.

Seems like the algorithm works.

Now, to implement this in code, I need to:

- Initialize tortoise and hare to nums[0]

- Move tortoise one step, hare two steps until they meet.

- Reset tortoise to nums[0]

- Move both one step at a time until they meet again. That's the duplicate.

I need to handle the case where the array has only two elements, but according to the constraints, n >= 1, so nums.length >= 2.

Also, need to ensure that the indices are within bounds when moving hare two steps.

Let me try to write a small example in code to verify.

Take nums = [1,3,4,2,2]

First phase:

tortoise = 1, hare = nums[nums[0]] = nums[1] = 3

tortoise = 3, hare = nums[nums[1]] = nums[3] = 2

tortoise = 2, hare = nums[nums[3]] = nums[2] = 4

tortoise = 4, hare = nums[nums[4]] = nums[4] = 2

tortoise = 2, hare = nums[nums[4]] = nums[2] = 4

tortoise = 4, hare = nums[nums[4]] = nums[4] = 2

tortoise = 2, hare = nums[nums[2]] = nums[4] = 2

They meet at 2.

Second phase:

reset tortoise to 1

Move:

tortoise = 3, hare = 2 → not same

tortoise = 2, hare = 4 → not same

tortoise = 4, hare = 2 → not same

tortoise = 2, hare = 4 → not same

tortoise = 4, hare = 2 → not same

tortoise = 2, hare = 4 → not same

This seems off. Wait, in the first example earlier, they met at 2 in the second phase, but here they don't.

Wait, in the first example, they did meet at 2 in the second phase.

Wait, perhaps I need to move tortoise from the start, which is nums[0] = 1, and hare from the meeting point, which is 2.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Upon reviewing, in the second phase, both tortoise and hare are moved one step at a time, starting from nums[0] and the meeting point, respectively, until they meet at the entrance to the cycle.

Wait, actually, in the second phase, both pointers are moved at the same pace starting from nums[0] and the meeting point.

Let me try that.

First phase:

tortoise = 1, hare = nums[nums[0]] = 3

tortoise = 3, hare = nums[nums[3]] = 2

tortoise = 2, hare = nums[nums[4]] = 4

tortoise = 4, hare = nums[nums[2]] = 4

tortoise = 4, hare = 4 → meet at 4

Second phase:

tortoise = 1, hare = 4

Move:

tortoise = 3, hare = 2

tortoise = 2, hare = 4

tortoise = 4, hare = 2

tortoise = 2, hare = 4

tortoise = 4, hare = 2

This seems like an infinite loop. Maybe this approach doesn't work in all cases.

Alternatively, perhaps I should keep one pointer at the meeting point and move another pointer from the start, both at the same speed, and they will meet at the entrance to the cycle.

Wait, that's the standard Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm for cycle detection.

Let me look up a reliable source for this algorithm applied to array duplicate finding.

Upon checking, the algorithm is:

1. Initialize both tortoise and hare to nums[0].

2. In the first phase, move tortoise one step and hare two steps until they meet.

3. In the second phase, move tortoise back to nums[0], and move both tortoise and hare one step at a time until they meet again. The meeting point is the duplicate number.

In the earlier example, it seemed like they met at 4, but 2 was the duplicate.

Wait, in the first example, nums = [1,3,4,2,2], the duplicate is 2, and according to the algorithm, they should meet at 2 in the second phase.

But in my earlier steps, they kept looping without meeting at 2.

Maybe I'm making a mistake in the second phase.

Let me try again.

First phase:

tortoise = 1, hare = nums[nums[0]] = 3

tortoise = 3, hare = nums[nums[3]] = 2

tortoise = 2, hare = nums[nums[4]] = 4

tortoise = 4, hare = nums[nums[2]] = 4

They meet at 4.

Second phase:

tortoise = 1, hare = 4

Move:

tortoise = 3, hare = 2

tortoise = 2, hare = 4

tortoise = 4, hare = 2

tortoise = 2, hare = 4

tortoise = 4, hare = 2

It seems like they are in a loop without meeting.

This suggests that perhaps the algorithm requires a different condition for moving the pointers in the second phase.

Upon further research, the correct approach is to move both pointers one step at a time, starting from nums[0] and the meeting point, and they will meet at the entrance to the cycle, which is the duplicate number.

In the first example, nums = [1,3,4,2,2], the duplicate is 2, and according to the algorithm, they should meet at 2 in the second phase.

But in my steps, they are looping between 2 and 4.

Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in how the pointers are moved.

Wait, maybe the second phase should involve moving one pointer from the start and the other from the meeting point, both at the same speed, and they will meet at the duplicate.

In the first example:

nums = [1,3,4,2,2]

First phase:

tortoise: 1, hare: 3

tortoise: 3, hare: 2

tortoise: 2, hare: 4

tortoise: 4, hare: 4 → meet at 4

Second phase:

tortoise = 1, hare = 4

Move:

tortoise = 3, hare = 2

tortoise = 2, hare = 4

tortoise = 4, hare = 2

tortoise = 2, hare = 4

tortoise = 4, hare = 2

It seems like they are in a loop. Maybe the algorithm requires a different condition.

Upon checking the algorithm more carefully, it's important to move both pointers one step at a time in the second phase, and they will meet at the entrance to the cycle, which is the duplicate number.

In this case, it seems like they are oscillating between 2 and 4, which might indicate that 4 is part of the cycle but not the entrance.

Wait, in the first example, the cycle is 4 -> 2 -> 4, and the entrance is 2, which is the duplicate.

But according to my steps, they are not meeting at 2.

Perhaps I need to consider that the meeting point in the second phase is the entrance to the cycle.

In this case, the entrance is 2, but in my steps, they keep oscillating between 2 and 4.

Maybe I need to look for the point where they meet in the second phase.

Alternatively, perhaps the algorithm isn't directly applicable here, or there's a mistake in my application.

Let me consider another approach.

Since the array contains numbers from 1 to n, and one number is repeated, I can think of this as a graph where each index points to the value at that index.

In this graph, there will be a cycle corresponding to the duplicate number.

The entrance to the cycle will be the duplicate number.

Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm is supposed to find the entrance to the cycle in such a graph.

Given that, perhaps I need to implement the algorithm more carefully.

Let me try to implement it step by step in code to see if that resolves the issue.

I'll write a small Python function to simulate this.

Difficulty: Medium
Original Question: The **abbreviation** of a word is a concatenation of its first letter, the number of characters between the first and last letter, and its last letter. If a word has only two characters, then it is an **abbreviation** of itself.

For example:

*   `dog --> d1g` because there is one letter between the first letter `'d'` and the last letter `'g'`.
*   `internationalization --> i18n` because there are 18 letters between the first letter `'i'` and the last letter `'n'`.
*   `it --> it` because any word with only two characters is an **abbreviation** of itself.

Implement the `ValidWordAbbr` class:

*   `ValidWordAbbr(String[] dictionary)` Initializes the object with a `dictionary` of words.
*   `boolean isUnique(string word)` Returns `true` if **either** of the following conditions are met (otherwise returns `false`):
    *   There is no word in `dictionary` whose **abbreviation** is equal to `word`'s **abbreviation**.
    *   For any word in `dictionary` whose **abbreviation** is equal to `word`'s **abbreviation**, that word and `word` are **the same**.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "ValidWordAbbr ",  "isUnique ",  "isUnique ",  "isUnique ",  "isUnique ",  "isUnique "\]
\[\[\[ "deer ",  "door ",  "cake ",  "card "\]\], \[ "dear "\], \[ "cart "\], \[ "cane "\], \[ "make "\], \[ "cake "\]\]
**Output**
\[null, false, true, false, true, true\]

**Explanation**
ValidWordAbbr validWordAbbr = new ValidWordAbbr(\[ "deer ",  "door ",  "cake ",  "card "\]);
validWordAbbr.isUnique( "dear "); // return false, dictionary word  "deer " and word  "dear " have the same abbreviation  "d2r " but are not the same.
validWordAbbr.isUnique( "cart "); // return true, no words in the dictionary have the abbreviation  "c2t ".
validWordAbbr.isUnique( "cane "); // return false, dictionary word  "cake " and word  "cane " have the same abbreviation   "c2e " but are not the same.
validWordAbbr.isUnique( "make "); // return true, no words in the dictionary have the abbreviation  "m2e ".
validWordAbbr.isUnique( "cake "); // return true, because  "cake " is already in the dictionary and no other word in the dictionary has  "c2e " abbreviation.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= dictionary.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 20`
*   `dictionary[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
*   `1 <= word.length <= 20`

Attacked Question: The **abbreviation** of a word is a concatenation of its first letter, the number of characters between the first and last letter, and its last letter. If a word has only two characters, then it is an **abbreviation** of itself.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to design a class `ValidWordAbbr` that can efficiently handle the initialization with a dictionary of words and check if a given word has a unique abbreviation based on the rules provided.

### Approach

1. **Abbreviation Calculation**:
   - For any word, its abbreviation is formed by taking the first letter, followed by the count of characters between the first and last letter, followed by the last letter.
   - If the word has only two characters, it is its own abbreviation.

2. **Initialization**:
   - We need to process the dictionary during initialization to compute the abbreviations of all words in the dictionary.
   - We will use a hash map to store the abbreviations and the corresponding set of words that have that abbreviation. This helps in checking uniqueness efficiently.

3. **Checking Uniqueness**:
   - For a given word, compute its abbreviation.
   - Check if this abbreviation exists in the dictionary.
   - If it does, ensure that the only word in the dictionary with this abbreviation is the word itself.
   - If the abbreviation does not exist in the dictionary or the only word with this abbreviation is the word itself, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

Original Question: According to [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life): "The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. "

The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: **live** (represented by a `1`) or **dead** (represented by a `0`). Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, return _the next state_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[0,1,0\],\[0,0,1\],\[1,1,1\],\[0,0,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[0,0,0\],\[1,0,1\],\[0,1,1\],\[0,1,0\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\[1,1\],\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[1,1\],\[1,1\]\]

**Constraints:**

Attacked Question: According to [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life): "The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. "

The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: **live** (represented by a `1`) or **dead** (represented by a `0`). Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, return _the next state_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[0,1,0\],\[0,0,1\],\[1,1,1\],\[0,0,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[0,0,0\],\[1,0,1\],\[0,1,1\],\[0,1,0\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\[1,1\],\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[1,1\],\[1,1\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 25`
*   `board[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to simulate the next state of a grid according to the rules of Conway's Game of Life. The challenge is to update the grid correctly, considering that each cell's next state depends on its current state and the states of its eight neighbors.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Rules:**
   - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (under-population).
   - Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
   - Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (over-population).
   - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

2. **Counting Live Neighbors:**
   - For each cell, we need to count the number of its live neighbors.
   - We need to consider the eight possible neighbors (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally adjacent cells).

3. **Updating the Grid:**
   - We cannot update the grid in place immediately because the new state of each cell depends on the old states of all cells.
   - One way to handle this is to use an additional grid to store the next state, but to optimize space, we can use tricks to store intermediate states.

4. **Optimized In-Place Update:**
   - Use two extra digits in each cell to represent the new state.
   - The least significant digit represents the current state, and the next digit represents the new state.
   - After computing the new states, right-shift the grid to make the new states the current states.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if there is a one-to-one mapping (bijection) between each character in the `pattern` and each word in the string `s`. This means that each character in the pattern should map to a unique word in `s`, and each word in `s` should be mapped by only one character in the pattern.

### Approach

1. **Split the String:** First, split the string `s` into a list of words based on spaces.
2. **Check Lengths:** If the number of characters in the pattern is not equal to the number of words in `s`, return `False`.
3. **Use Two Dictionaries:** 
   - One dictionary to map characters from the pattern to words in `s`.
   - Another dictionary to map words in `s` back to characters in the pattern.
4. **Iterate and Check Mappings:**
   - For each character and corresponding word, check if the character already maps to the word and vice versa.
   - If there is a mismatch in mapping, return `False`.

Original Question: Given a `pattern` and a string `s`, return `true` _if_ `s` _**matches** the_ `pattern`_._

A string `s` **matches** a `pattern` if there is some **bijective mapping** of single characters to strings such that if each character in `pattern` is replaced by the string it maps to, then the resulting string is `s`. A **bijective mapping** means that no two characters map to the same string, and no character maps to two different strings.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** pattern =  "abab ", s =  "redblueredblue "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One possible mapping is as follows:
'a' ->  "red "
'b' ->  "blue "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** pattern =  "aaaa ", s =  "asdasdasdasd "

**Explanation:** One possible mapping is as follows:

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if there is a bijective mapping between each character in the `pattern` and substrings of `s` such that replacing each character in the pattern with its corresponding substring results in `s`. This requires a mapping where each character maps to a unique substring and no two characters map to the same substring.

### Approach

1. **Backtracking**: We will use a backtracking approach to try all possible mappings of characters in the pattern to substrings of `s`. We need to ensure that the mapping is bijective, meaning it's one-to-one and onto.

2. **Mapping and Reverse Mapping**: We will use two dictionaries:
   - One to map characters from the pattern to substrings of `s`.
   - Another to map substrings of `s` back to characters to ensure bijectivity.

3. **Index Tracking**: We will track the current positions in both the pattern and the string `s` to ensure we are building the mapping correctly.

CoT: I'm going to solve this Nim Game problem in Python. The problem is about determining whether I can win the game given that both I and my friend play optimally. The game involves a heap of stones, and each player can remove 1 to 3 stones in their turn. The player who removes the last stone wins.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics and the concept of optimal play. Since both players play optimally, they will always make the best possible move to ensure their victory.

Let's consider some small values of n to identify a pattern or a strategy.

- If n = 1: I can remove the only stone and win. So, return True.

- If n = 2: I can remove two stones and win. So, return True.

- If n = 3: I can remove three stones and win. So, return True.

- If n = 4: No matter how many stones I remove (1, 2, or 3), my friend can remove the remaining stones and win. So, return False.

- If n = 5: If I remove one stone, leaving 4 stones, my friend will lose as per the previous case. So, I can win by removing one stone.

- If n = 6: Similarly, I can remove two stones, leaving 4 stones for my friend, ensuring their loss.

- If n = 7: Remove three stones, leaving 4 stones for my friend.

- If n = 8: No matter how many stones I remove (1, 2, or 3), my friend can be left with a winning position (5, 6, or 7 stones), and I would lose.

From these observations, it seems that whenever n is a multiple of 4, I lose if both play optimally. Otherwise, I can force a win.

So, the strategy is:

- If n % 4 == 0, return False.

- Else, return True.

This seems like a straightforward solution. But I should verify it with more examples to ensure its correctness.

- n = 9: 9 % 4 = 1 → True (I can win).

- n = 10: 10 % 4 = 2 → True.

- n = 11: 11 % 4 = 3 → True.

- n = 12: 12 % 4 = 0 → False.

- n = 13: 13 % 4 = 1 → True.

This pattern holds for these values.

Now, considering the constraints, n can be as large as 2^31 - 1, which is a very large number. But since our solution runs in constant time, O(1), it should be efficient enough.

Edge cases to consider:

- n = 0: But according to constraints, n >= 1, so no need to handle n = 0.

- n = 1: Already handled, returns True.

- n = 4: Returns False.

- n = 2147483647: 2147483647 % 4 = 7 % 4 = 3 → True.

I should also consider if n is negative, but constraints specify n >= 1, so no need to handle negatives.

Therefore, the solution is to check if n is not a multiple of 4.

In Python, the code would look like this:

CoT: I'm going to solve this problem step by step. So, the problem is about a game where you and your friend take turns flipping two consecutive '+' into '--' in a string that consists of '+' and '-'. The player who can no longer make a move loses the game. I need to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win given the initial state of the string.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics clearly. The game is alternately played by two players, let's call them Player A and Player B. Player A starts first. At each turn, a player must choose two consecutive '+' characters and replace them with '--'. If a player cannot make such a move, they lose the game.

So, the goal is to see if Player A can always win, assuming both players play optimally.

I recall that this kind of problem can be solved using game theory, specifically by determining the winning and losing states. In game theory, a position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is can force a win, and a losing position if no matter what move they make, the opponent can force a win.

Given that, I need to find out if the initial state is a winning position for Player A.

One way to approach this is to use recursion and memoization, exploring all possible moves from the current state and seeing if any of them lead to a losing position for the opponent.

Let me think about the base case. If there are no more possible moves, the player whose turn it is loses. So, if I can find that from the current state, there are no two consecutive '+'s, then the current player loses.

Otherwise, the current player can make a move by flipping any two consecutive '+'s into '--'s, and then the opponent plays from the new state. If any of these moves lead to a state where the opponent loses, then the current player can win by making that move.

This sounds like a classic minimax problem, where I need to explore all possible game trajectories.

To optimize, I should use memoization to store the results of subproblems, since the same game state might be reached through different sequences of moves.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Define a function, say `canWin`, that takes the current state as input and returns True if the current player can win from this state, otherwise False.

2. Use a cache to store the results of `canWin` for each unique state to avoid redundant computations.

3. In the `canWin` function:

a. If there are no two consecutive '+'s, return False (current player loses).

b. Otherwise, iterate through all possible moves (i.e., all pairs of consecutive '+'s).

c. For each possible move, flip the two '+'s to '--'s, and recursively call `canWin` on the new state.

d. If any of these recursive calls return False, meaning the opponent cannot win from that state, then return True (current player can win).

e. If all recursive calls return True, meaning the opponent can always force a win, then return False (current player loses).

4. Start the recursion from the initial state.

This seems straightforward, but I need to consider the efficiency, especially since the string can be up to 60 characters long.

Given that the string can be up to 60 characters, and each character is either '+' or '-', the number of possible states is 2^60, which is astronomically large. However, in practice, many states are not reachable, and with memoization, we can handle a reasonable number of unique states.

But I need to think about optimizing this further.

Another approach is to model this game as an impartial game under the Sprague-Grundy theorem, which is often used in impartial game theory to determine the winner based on the XOR of the Grundy numbers of individual components.

In this theorem, each position in the game is assigned a Grundy number, and if the XOR of all Grundy numbers is non-zero, the first player can win; otherwise, the second player can win.

However, I'm not sure if this game can be easily decomposed into independent subgames.

Let me consider the game state. The string can be divided into segments separated by '-' characters, and each segment consists of a sequence of '+' characters.

For example, in "++-++", there are two segments: "++" and "++".

In "++++", there's only one segment: "++++".

In "+-+-+", there are three segments: "+", "+", "+".

Each segment can be treated as an independent subgame, and the overall game is the combination of these subgames.

If I can find the Grundy number for each segment, then the XOR of all these Grundy numbers will determine the winner.

So, the problem reduces to finding the Grundy number for a single segment of '+' characters.

Let me recall how to compute the Grundy number for a segment.

The Grundy number for a position is the minimum excludant (mex) of the Grundy numbers of the positions reachable in one move.

The mex of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

In this game, a move in a segment consists of flipping two consecutive '+'s to '--'s, effectively splitting the segment into two smaller segments, with a '-' in between.

Wait, no. Flipping two consecutive '+'s to '--'s in a segment reduces the segment's length by two, and inserts '--' in place of those two '+'s.

For example, in "++++", flipping the middle "++" turns it into "+--+".

Wait, but in terms of segments, "++++" -> "+--+" still has two segments: "+" and "+".

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption that segments are separated by '-'s is not accurate, because flipping "++" to "--" introduces '--', which might affect the segmentation.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I should consider the entire string as a single game and compute its Grundy number directly, without trying to decompose it into segments.

Given the string's length is up to 60, and each position can be either '+' or '-', the state space is still too large for a straightforward implementation.

Perhaps I need to find a pattern or a mathematical formula that can determine the winner without enumerating all possible moves.

Alternatively, I can consider the number of "++" pairs in the string.

But simply counting the number of "++" pairs isn't enough, because the positions of these pairs matter.

For example, in "++++", there are three "++" pairs, but flipping any one of them affects the others.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node represents a state, and edges represent possible moves, and then determine if the initial state is a winning state.

But with up to 60 characters, the number of states is too large to handle practically.

Let me consider smaller examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Example 1:

Input: "++++"

Possible moves:

- Flip positions 0 and 1: "--++"

- Flip positions 1 and 2: "+--+"

- Flip positions 2 and 3: "++--"

From each of these states, the opponent can make moves.

For example, from "--++", the opponent can flip positions 2 and 3 to "--__":
- "--__"

From "+--+", the opponent can flip positions 0 and 1 to "__--+", or positions 2 and 3 to "+----".

From "++--", the opponent can flip positions 0 and 1 to "--__", or positions 1 and 2 to "+---".

It's getting complicated to track all these moves manually.

Another example:

Input: "+"

No possible moves, so the starting player loses.

Input: "++"

Only one possible move: flip positions 0 and 1 to "--", and the opponent cannot move, so the starting player wins.

Input: "+++"

Possible moves:

- Flip positions 0 and 1: "--+"

- Flip positions 1 and 2: "+--"

In both cases, the opponent cannot make any moves, so the starting player wins.

Wait, in "+++", flipping "++" to "--" results in "--+", and flipping the last "++" results in "+--". In both cases, the opponent has no moves, so the starting player wins.

Input: "++-++"

Possible moves:

- Flip positions 0 and 1: "-- -++"

- Flip positions 2 and 3: "++ -- +"

- Flip positions 3 and 4: "++ - --"

After each move, the opponent has no moves, so the starting player wins.

Wait, in "++-++", flipping positions 0 and 1 gives "-- -++", and the opponent can flip positions 4 and 5 to "-- --_", which has no more moves. Similarly, flipping positions 3 and 4 gives "++ - --", and the opponent has no moves.

So in this case, the starting player can win.

Wait, but according to the earlier approach, if I consider segments separated by '-', maybe I can count the number of segments and determine the winner based on that.

But in "++-++", there are two segments: "++" and "++", and the starting player can win.

In "++++", there's one segment: "++++", and the starting player can win.

In "+++", there's one segment: "+++", and the starting player can win.

In "++", one segment: "++", starting player wins.

In "+", one segment: "+", starting player loses.

In "--", no segments, starting player loses.

In "-+", one segment: "+", starting player loses.

In "-++-", two segments: "+" and "+", starting player can flip the first "++" to "--", resulting in "-- --", and the opponent has no moves, so starting player wins.

Wait, but according to the earlier examples, it seems that if the number of segments with an odd number of '+' characters is odd, the starting player wins; otherwise, loses.

Wait, let's check:

- "++++": one segment with 4 '+'s (even), so number of odd segments is 0 (even), starting player loses. But earlier, I thought starting player can win. Wait, maybe this hypothesis is wrong.

- "+++": one segment with 3 '+'s (odd), so number of odd segments is 1 (odd), starting player wins. Yes, matches.

- "++-++": two segments, each with 2 '+'s (even), so number of odd segments is 0 (even), starting player loses. But earlier, I thought starting player can win. Contradiction.

- "+": one segment with 1 '+' (odd), number of odd segments is 1 (odd), starting player wins. But actually, starting player loses.

- "--": no segments with '+'s, number of odd segments is 0 (even), starting player loses. Matches.

- "-+": one segment with 1 '+' (odd), number of odd segments is 1 (odd), starting player wins. But actually, starting player loses.

- "-++-": two segments with 1 and 1 '+'s (both odd), number of odd segments is 2 (even), starting player loses. But in earlier thought, starting player can win.

This hypothesis doesn't hold.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider the game as a Nim game, where each "++" pair is a pile, and flipping "++" to "--" is like removing that pile.

But the problem is that flipping "++" to "--" affects the surrounding characters, as it inserts '--', which can merge or split segments.

Wait, for example, in "++++", flipping the middle "++" to "--" results in "+--+", which has two segments: "+" and "+".

In "++-++", flipping any "++" to "--" results in "-- -++", "+--+", or "++ --", each of which has segments that are "+" and "++", or variations.

It's not straightforward to model this as a simple Nim game.

Perhaps I need to consider the number of "++" pairs available.

But just counting the number of "++" pairs isn't enough, because the positions matter.

For example, in "++++", there are three "++" pairs, but flipping any one reduces the number of "++" pairs in a way that affects the others.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a graph where each node represents a state, and edges represent possible moves, and determine if the initial state is winning or losing based on the parity of the number of moves.

But with up to 60 characters, this approach is not feasible.

Let me consider the recursive approach with memoization.

I can represent the state as a string, and use a cache to store whether the current player can win from that state.

The base case is when there are no "++" pairs left, the current player loses.

Otherwise, for each possible move (i.e., each "++" pair), flip it to "--" and recursively check if the opponent cannot win from the new state.

If any such move exists, the current player can win; otherwise, they lose.

This seems correct, but I need to ensure that the memoization handles all possible states efficiently.

Given that the string can be up to 60 characters, and each character is either '+' or '-', the total number of possible states is 2^60, which is too large.

However, in practice, many states are not reachable, and the number of unique states encountered during the recursion might be manageable.

I can implement this approach and see how it performs.

Alternatively, I can try to find a mathematical pattern or formula that can determine the winner based on the initial state without recursing through all possible moves.

Let me think about the game in terms of game theory once more.

This game is similar to Nim, where players take turns removing objects from piles, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

In Nim, the winning strategy is based on the XOR of the pile sizes.

But in this game, the moves affect the string in a way that is not directly translatable to Nim piles.

Another thought: perhaps I can model each maximal sequence of '+' characters as a pile, and the number of "++" pairs in each pile determines the pile size.

Wait, in "++++", there are three "++" pairs, but flipping one affects the others.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider the number of possible flips.

Each "++" pair can be flipped independently, but flipping one affects the availability of adjacent "++" pairs.

This interdependence makes it difficult to model as independent piles.

Another approach: since the game is impartial (both players have the same moves available to them at any state), I can use the Sprague-Grundy theorem to assign a Grundy number to each state, and if the overall Grundy number is non-zero, the first player can win.

But I need to define the Grundy number for each subgame, and combine them via XOR.

In this case, since the game isn't clearly separable into independent subgames, it's tricky to apply this directly.

Wait, perhaps I can consider each maximal sequence of '+' characters as a subgame.

For example, in "++-++", there are two subgames: "++" and "++".

In "++++", there's one subgame: "++++".

In "+++-", there are two subgames: "+++" and "" (but empty strings don't matter).

Wait, but flipping "++" in "++++" affects the entire sequence.

For example, flipping the middle "++" in "++++" to "--" results in "+--+", which is two separate "+" segments.

So, perhaps, each maximal sequence of '+' characters can be considered a separate subgame.

In that case, the Grundy number of the entire game is the XOR of the Grundy numbers of these subgames.

I need to define the Grundy number for a single sequence of '+' characters.

Let's define `g(n)` as the Grundy number for a sequence of `n` '+' characters.

Base cases:

- `g(0) = 0` (no moves possible, losing position)

- `g(1) = 0` (no moves possible, losing position)

For `n >= 2`, possible moves are to flip any "++" pair to "--", which splits the sequence into two smaller sequences, each with length depending on the position of the flip.

Wait, in "++++", flipping the first "++" results in "--++", which is two sequences: "--" and "++".

But "--" is just "--", which has no moves, so it's a losing position for the opponent.

Flipping the middle "++" results in "+--+", which is two sequences: "+" and "+".

Flipping the last "++" results in "++--", which is two sequences: "++" and "--".

So, from "++++", the possible moves are to:

- "--++" (subgames: "--" and "++": g(0) XOR g(2))

- "+--+" (subgames: "+" and "+": g(1) XOR g(1))

- "++--" (subgames: "++" and "--": g(2) XOR g(0))

The mex of the set {g(0) XOR g(2), g(1) XOR g(1), g(2) XOR g(0)} determines g(4).

This seems promising, but I need to generalize it.

Let me try to compute g(n) for small n.

Compute g(2):

Possible moves: flip positions 0 and 1 to "--", resulting in "--", which has no moves, so g(0) = 0.

So, the set of reachable positions is {0}, hence g(2) = mex{0} = 1.

Compute g(3):

Possible moves:

- flip positions 0 and 1: "--+", which is "--" and "+" : g(0) XOR g(1) = 0 XOR 0 = 0

- flip positions 1 and 2: "+--", which is "+" and "--": g(1) XOR g(0) = 0 XOR 0 = 0

So, set of reachable positions is {0}, hence g(3) = mex{0} = 1.

Compute g(4):

Possible moves:

- flip positions 0 and 1: "--++", which is "--" and "++": g(0) XOR g(2) = 0 XOR 1 = 1

- flip positions 1 and 2: "+--+", which is "+" and "+": g(1) XOR g(1) = 0 XOR 0 = 0

- flip positions 2 and 3: "++--", which is "++" and "--": g(2) XOR g(0) = 1 XOR 0 = 1

So, set of reachable positions is {1, 0}, hence g(4) = mex{0,1} = 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought g(4) should be 1. Let me check again.

Wait, no, mex of {0,1} is 2, which is correct.

Compute g(5):

Possible moves:

- flip positions 0 and 1: "--+++", which is "--" and "+++": g(0) XOR g(3) = 0 XOR 1 = 1

- flip positions 1 and 2: "+--++", which is "+" and "++": g(1) XOR g(2) = 0 XOR 1 = 1

- flip positions 2 and 3: "++--+", which is "++" and "+": g(2) XOR g(1) = 1 XOR 0 = 1

- flip positions 3 and 4: "+++--", which is "+++" and "--": g(3) XOR g(0) = 1 XOR 0 = 1

So, set of reachable positions is {1}, hence g(5) = mex{1} = 0.

Interesting, g(5) = 0.

So, for n=2: g(2)=1

n=3: g(3)=1

n=4: g(4)=2

n=5: g(5)=0

Continue to n=6:

Possible moves:

- flip positions 0 and 1: "--++++", which is "--" and "++++": g(0) XOR g(4) = 0 XOR 2 = 2

- flip positions 1 and 2: "+--+++", which is "+" and "+++": g(1) XOR g(3) = 0 XOR 1 = 1

- flip positions 2 and 3: "++--++", which is "++" and "++": g(2) XOR g(2) = 1 XOR 1 = 0

- flip positions 3 and 4: "+++--+", which is "+++" and "+": g(3) XOR g(1) = 1 XOR 0 = 1

- flip positions 4 and 5: "++++--", which is "++++" and "--": g(4) XOR g(0) = 2 XOR 0 = 2

So, set of reachable positions is {2,1,0}, hence g(6) = mex{0,1,2} = 3.

Continuing this way, I can compute g(n) for higher n, but it's time-consuming.

Now, for the original game, I need to consider the entire string, which may have multiple segments of '+' characters separated by '-'.

Each such segment can be treated as an independent subgame, and the overall game's Grundy number is the XOR of the Grundy numbers of these subgames.

If the XOR is non-zero, the starting player can win; otherwise, they cannot.

So, in code, I need to:

1. Split the initial state into segments of '+' characters separated by '-'.

2. For each segment, compute its Grundy number using the function g(len(segment)).

3. XOR all these Grundy numbers together.

4. If the result is non-zero, return True; else, return False.

To implement this, I need to compute g(n) for various n efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 60, I can precompute g(n) for n from 0 to 60.

I need to write a function to compute g(n) based on the recursive definition.

I can use memoization to store g(n) for each n.

Here's a plan for the code:

- Initialize a list `grundy` with size 61, all set to -1 (uncomputed).

- Define a function `compute_grundy(n)` that computes g(n) using memoization.

- In `compute_grundy(n)`, if n == 0 or n == 1, return 0.

- If `grundy[n]` is already computed, return it.

- Otherwise, find all possible moves by flipping "++" to "--" in a string of n '+'s, which corresponds to splitting the sequence into two parts: one of length i and one of length n-2-i, for i from 0 to n-2.

- For each possible split, compute the XOR of g(i) and g(n-2-i).

- Find the mex of the set of these XOR values.

- Set `grundy[n]` to the mex and return it.

- In the main function, split the input string into segments of '+' characters separated by '-'.

- For each segment, compute its Grundy number using `compute_grundy(len(segment))`.

- XOR all these Grundy numbers together.

- If the result is non-zero, return True; else, return False.

Wait, in the possible moves, flipping "++" in a sequence of n '+'s can be done at positions 0 to n-2, splitting the sequence into two parts: one of length i and one of length n-2-i.

For example, in "++++" (n=4):

- Flip positions 0-1: split into "" and "++" -> g(0) XOR g(2)

- Flip positions 1-2: split into "+" and "+" -> g(1) XOR g(1)

- Flip positions 2-3: split into "++" and "" -> g(2) XOR g(0)

So, the set of reachable positions is {g(0) XOR g(2), g(1) XOR g(1), g(2) XOR g(0)}.

Which is {0 XOR 1, 0 XOR 0, 1 XOR 0} = {1, 0, 1}, so mex is 2.

Similarly, for n=5:

- Flip positions 0-1: g(0) XOR g(3) = 0 XOR 1 = 1

- Flip positions 1-2: g(1) XOR g(2) = 0 XOR 1 = 1

- Flip positions 2-3: g(2) XOR g(1) = 1 XOR 0 = 1

- Flip positions 3-4: g(3) XOR g(0) = 1 XOR 0 = 1

So, set is {1}, mex is 0.

This matches my earlier calculations.

Now, I need to implement this logic in code.

I need to handle the splitting of the string into segments correctly.

For example, in "++-++", the segments are "++" and "++", so g(2) XOR g(2) = 1 XOR 1 = 0, which would suggest the starting player loses, but earlier I thought they could win. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in "++-++", flipping any "++" to "--" results in "-- -++" or "+--+", etc., which seem to leave the opponent with no moves. But according to the Grundy number calculation, g(2) XOR g(2) = 1 XOR 1 = 0, which indicates a losing position for the starting player. This seems contradictory.

Perhaps there's a mistake in the Grundy number calculation.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that flipping "++" to "--" not only affects the current segment but also can merge or split segments based on the surrounding characters.

In "++-++", flipping the first "++" to "--" results in "-- -++", which has segments "--" and "++". But "--" has no moves, so it's effectively g(0) XOR g(2) = 0 XOR 1 = 1.

Similarly, flipping the second "++" to "--" results in "++ --", which has segments "++" and "--": g(2) XOR g(0) = 1 XOR 0 = 1.

Flipping the middle "++" to "--" results in "+--+", which has segments "+" and "+": g(1) XOR g(1) = 0 XOR 0 = 0.

So, the set of reachable positions is {1,1,0}, so mex is 2, meaning g(5) = 2.

Wait, but earlier I calculated g(5) = 0. There's inconsistency here.

Wait, no. In "++-++", the entire string has two segments of "++", so g(2) XOR g(2) = 1 XOR 1 = 0, which is a losing position.

But according to the earlier thought, the starting player can flip any "++" to "--", leaving the opponent with no moves, which seems like a winning position.

This contradiction suggests that there's a flaw in this approach.

Perhaps modeling each segment independently isn't accurate because flipping "++" in one segment can affect adjacent segments by creating or removing '-' separators.

Alternatively, maybe the Sprague-Grundy theorem doesn't directly apply here because the game isn't a simple combination of independent subgames.

Given this confusion, perhaps I should revert to the recursive approach with memoization, considering the entire string as the game state.

In this approach, I represent the current state as a string, and use a cache to store whether the current player can win from that state.

Here's how I can implement it:

- Define a function `can_win(state)` that returns True if the current player can win from `state`, otherwise False.

- Use a cache to memoize the results based on the `state`.

- Base case: if there are no "++" in `state`, return False (current player loses).

- Otherwise, iterate over all possible positions where "++" occurs.

- For each "++" found, flip it to "--" to create a new state.

- Recursively call `can_win` on this new state.

- If any of these calls return False, meaning the opponent cannot win from that state, return True.

- If all calls return True, return False.

This approach ensures that I explore all possible moves and cache the results to avoid redundant computations.

Given that the string length is up to 60, and each character is either '+' or '-', the number of unique states should be manageable, especially since many states are not reachable.

I can implement this in Python using the `lru_cache` decorator from the `functools` module for memoization.

Let me sketch the code structure:

from functools import lru_cache

def can_win(state):

if "++" not in state:

return False

for i in range(len(state) - 1):

if state[i:i+2] == "++":

new_state = state[:i] + "--" + state[i+2:]

if not can_win(new_state):

return True

return False

# To use memoization:

can_win = lru_cache(maxsize=None)(can_win)

But actually, to use `lru_cache`, I need to make sure that the function arguments are hashable. Since strings are immutable and hashable, this should work.

However, with a string length of 60, and each character being '+' or '-', the number of unique states could still be large, but Python's `lru_cache` should handle it efficiently.

I can also consider representing the state as a tuple or a frozenset if needed, but string should be fine.

Let me test this approach with the example "++++":

- Initial state: "++++"

- Possible moves:

- Flip positions 0-1: "--++"

- Flip positions 1-2: "+--+""

- Flip positions 2-3: "++--"

- Check if any of these lead to a losing position for the opponent.

- For "--++":

- Possible move: flip positions 2-3: "-- --"

- No more "++", so opponent loses. Hence, current player wins.

- Similarly, for "+--+", no more "++", opponent loses.

- For "++--", flip positions 0-1: "-- --", opponent loses.

- So, all moves lead to opponent losing, meaning current player can win.

Wait, but according to the recursive function, it would check each move and see that the opponent loses, so it should return True.

Another example: "+"

- No "++", so immediately return False.

Correct.

Another example: "++"

- Flip positions 0-1: "--", no more "++", opponent loses. So, current player wins.

Correct.

Seems consistent.

Given that, I can proceed with this approach.

Now, to implement this in code, I need to define the `can_win` function with memoization.

I should also consider the efficiency, but given the constraints and Python's capabilities, it should be manageable.

Finally, return the result of `can_win(currentState)`.

I need to make sure that the function handles empty strings correctly, but since the constraints say that the string length is at least 1, I don't need to handle the empty string case explicitly.

Also, need to ensure that the function doesn't go into an infinite recursion, but with memoization, each unique state is visited only once.

Let me think about potential optimizations.

Since the string can be up to 60 characters, and in the worst case, the recursion depth could be up to 60/2 = 30 (if every move removes two characters), it should be fine.

I don't think there's a need for further optimization.

Now, I can proceed to implement the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win in a game where players take turns flipping two consecutive "++" into "--" in a string consisting of '+' and '-'. The game ends when a player can no longer make a move, and the other player wins.

### Approach

1. **Game Rules and Objective**:
   - Players alternately flip two consecutive "++" into "--".
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Insight**:
   - This is a turn-based game with perfect information, suggesting a solution via game theory.
   - We can determine if the starting player can force a win by exploring all possible moves recursively and using memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

3. **Recursive Function with Memoization**:
   - Define a function `can_win` that takes the current state of the string.
   - Use memoization to store results of subproblems, avoiding redundant computations.
   - Base Case: If there are no "++" in the string, the current player loses.
   - For each possible move (i.e., each occurrence of "++"), flip it to "--" and recursively check if the opponent cannot win from the new state.
   - If any move leads to the opponent's loss, the current player can win from this state.

\[null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0\]

**Explanation**
MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
medianFinder.addNum(1);    // arr = \[1\]
medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = \[1, 2\]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)
medianFinder.addNum(3);    // arr\[1, 2, 3\]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 2.0

**Constraints:**

*   `-105 <= num <= 105`
*   There will be at least one element in the data structure before calling `findMedian`.
*   At most `5 * 104` calls will be made to `addNum` and `findMedian`.

**Follow up:**

*   If all integer numbers from the stream are in the range `[0, 100]`, how would you optimize your solution?
*   If `99%` of all integer numbers from the stream are in the range `[0, 100]`, how would you optimize your solution?
Attacked Question: The **median** is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

*   For example, for `arr = [2,3,4]`, the median is `3`.
*   For example, for `arr = [2,3]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

Implement the MedianFinder class:

*   `MedianFinder()` initializes the `MedianFinder` object.
*   `void addNum(int num)` adds the integer `num` from the data stream to the data structure.
*   `double findMedian()` returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "MedianFinder ",  "addNum ",  "addNum ",  "findMedian ",  "addNum ",  "findMedian "\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[3\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0\]

**Explanation**
MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
medianFinder.addNum(1);    // arr = \[1\]
medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = \[1, 2\]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)

*   If `99%` of all integer numbers from the stream are in the range `[0, 100]`, how would you optimize your solution?
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to design a data structure that can efficiently handle the addition of numbers and quickly find the median of all numbers added so far. The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list, and if the list has an even number of elements, it is the average of the two middle numbers.

### Approach

1. **Data Structure Selection**:
   - We will use two heaps to efficiently compute the median:
     - A max-heap to store the smaller half of the numbers.
     - A min-heap to store the larger half of the numbers.
   - This setup allows us to quickly access the middle elements.

2. **Balancing Heaps**:
   - After adding a number, we ensure that both heaps are balanced, meaning they have equal sizes or the max-heap has one more element than the min-heap.
   - This balance ensures that the median can be found easily from the top of these heaps.

3. **Adding a Number**:
   - Add the number to one of the heaps based on its value compared to the current median.
   - Rebalance the heaps if necessary to maintain the size property.

4. **Finding the Median**:
   - If the heaps are of equal size, the median is the average of the tops of both heaps.
   - If the max-heap has one more element than the min-heap, the median is the top of the max-heap.

### Solution Code
Response: python
import heapq

class MedianFinder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_heap = []  # stores the smaller half

Original Question: Given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where each `1` marks the home of one friend, return _the minimal **total travel distance**_.

The **total travel distance** is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.

The distance is calculated using [Manhattan Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), where `distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,0,0,0,1\],\[0,0,0,0,0\],\[0,0,1,0,0\]\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Given three friends living at (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2).
The point (0,2) is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 is minimal.
So return 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,1\]\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
*   There will be **at least two** friends in the `grid`.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find a meeting point in a grid such that the sum of Manhattan distances from this point to all the points of interest (where `grid[i][j] == 1`) is minimized. This is classic optimization problem where the optimal meeting point corresponds to the median of the coordinates.

### Approach

1. **Extract Coordinates:** Collect the row and column indices where `grid[i][j] == 1`.
2. **Find Median:** The median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations. So, find the median of the row indices and the median of the column indices.
3. **Calculate Total Distance:** Compute the sum of Manhattan distances from the median point to all points.

Original Question: Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to design an algorithm that can serialize a binary tree into a string and then deserialize that string back into the original binary tree. There are multiple ways to approach this, but one common method is to use preorder traversal for serialization and then use that serialized string to reconstruct the tree.

### Approach

1. **Serialization:**
   - We'll perform a preorder traversal of the tree.
   - For each node, we'll append its value to a list. If the node is `None`, we'll append a special character (e.g., 'N') to represent `None`.
   - Finally, we'll join the list into a string separated by commas.

2. **Deserialization:**
   - We'll split the serialized string back into a list of strings.
   - We'll use a pointer to track the current position in the list.
   - We'll recursively construct the tree by converting the string values back to integers or `None` based on the special character.
   - We'll handle the 'N' values appropriately to recreate the original tree structure.

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the length of the longest **consecutive sequence path**_.

A **consecutive sequence path** is a path where the values **increase by one** along the path.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest consecutive sequence in a binary tree. A consecutive sequence is defined as a path where each node's value is one more than its parent's value. The path can start at any node and cannot go from a node to its parent.

### Approach

1. **DFS Traversal**: We will use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree. For each node, we will check if its left or right child forms a consecutive sequence with it.
2. **Tracking Sequence Length**: We maintain a current length of the consecutive sequence as we traverse down the tree. If a child node's value is one more than the parent's value, we increment the current length; otherwise, we reset it to 1.
3. **Updating Maximum Length**: During the traversal, we keep track of the maximum length of the consecutive sequence found.

Original Question: You are playing the **[Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows)** game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

*   The number of "bulls ", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
*   The number of "cows ", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

Given the secret number `secret` and your friend's guess `guess`, return _the hint for your friend's guess_.

The hint should be formatted as `"xAyB "`, where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows. Note that both `secret` and `guess` may contain duplicate digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** secret =  "1807 ", guess =  "7810 "
**Output:**  "1A3B "
**Explanation:** Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
 "1807 "
  |
 "7810 "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** secret =  "1123 ", guess =  "0111 "

  |      or     |
 "0111 "         "0111 "
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000`
*   `secret.length == guess.length`

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to compare two strings: the secret number and the friend's guess. We have to count the number of "bulls" and "cows" based on the rules provided.

### Approach

1. **Bulls:**
   - These are the digits that are in the correct position.
   - We can iterate through both strings simultaneously and count the positions where the characters match.

2. **Cows:**
   - These are the digits that are present in the secret number but are in the wrong position.
   - To count cows, we need to consider the frequency of each digit in both strings, excluding the bulls already counted.
   - We can use a counter for each string to keep track of the frequency of each digit.
   - The number of cows for a particular digit is the minimum frequency of that digit in both counters, excluding the bulls.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in an array of integers. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Approach

1. **Brute Force Approach (Not Recommended):**
   - One way to solve this is to generate all possible subsequences and check which ones are strictly increasing, then find the longest one.
   - This approach is inefficient and has an exponential time complexity, which is not suitable for larger inputs.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - We can use dynamic programming to efficiently solve this problem.
   - We maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending with `nums[i]`.
   - For each element `nums[i]`, we compare it with all previous elements `nums[j]` where `j < i`. If `nums[i] > nums[j]`, it means we can extend the subsequence ending with `nums[j]` by including `nums[i]`.
   - Therefore, `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` for all `j < i` where `nums[i] > nums[j]`.
   - The length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the `dp` array.

3. **Efficient Approach using Binary Search (O(n log n)):**
   - We can optimize the approach further using binary search.
   - We maintain a list that represents the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences with length `i+1` in `tails[i]`.
   - For each number in `nums`, we find the position in `tails` to replace it with binary search.
   - This approach ensures that `tails` is always sorted, allowing us to use binary search efficiently.

    if not nums:

        else:

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to remove the minimum number of invalid parentheses from a given string to make it valid. The solution should return all unique strings that are valid with the minimum number of removals.

### Approach

1. **Identify Invalid Parentheses:** We need to determine which parentheses need to be removed to make the string valid. We can use a counter to track the balance of parentheses.
2. **Generate Valid Combinations:** We will generate all possible combinations of the string by removing parentheses and check if the resulting string is valid.
3. **Avoid Duplicates:** Since the problem requires unique strings, we will use a set to store the results.
4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** BFS is suitable here because it allows us to explore all possibilities level by level, which helps in finding the minimum number of removals first.

Original Question: You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `image` where `0` represents a white pixel and `1` represents a black pixel.

The black pixels are connected (i.e., there is only one black region). Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically.

Given two integers `x` and `y` that represents the location of one of the black pixels, return _the area of the smallest (axis-aligned) rectangle that encloses all black pixels_.

You must write an algorithm with less than `O(mn)` runtime complexity

**Example 1:**

**Input:** image = \[\[ "0 ", "0 ", "1 ", "0 "\],\[ "0 ", "1 ", "1 ", "0 "\],\[ "0 ", "1 ", "0 ", "0 "\]\], x = 0, y = 2

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest axis-aligned rectangle that encloses all the black pixels in a given binary matrix. We are given that the black pixels form a single connected component, and we are provided with the coordinates of one black pixel.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We need to find the minimum and maximum row indices and column indices that contain black pixels.
   - We are given one black pixel's coordinates (x, y), which can serve as a starting point.

2. **Traversal**:
   - We will perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the given black pixel to visit all connected black pixels.
   - During the DFS, we will update the minimum and maximum row and column indices whenever we visit a black pixel.

3. **Calculate the Area**:
   - Once all black pixels are visited, the smallest rectangle can be determined by the range of row and column indices.
   - The area of the rectangle is calculated as `(max_row - min_row + 1) * (max_col - min_col + 1)`.

1.  Calculate the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** where `left <= right`.

Implement the `NumArray` class:

*   `NumArray(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer array `nums`.
*   `int sumRange(int left, int right)` Returns the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** (i.e. `nums[left] + nums[left + 1] + ... + nums[right]`).

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "NumArray ",  "sumRange ",  "sumRange ",  "sumRange "\]
\[\[\[-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1\]\], \[0, 2\], \[2, 5\], \[0, 5\]\]

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to efficiently handle multiple range sum queries on a given integer array `nums`. The straightforward approach would be to iterate through the array each time a range is queried, but this would be inefficient for a large number of queries. Instead, we can precompute the prefix sums of the array, which allows us to answer each query in constant time.

### Approach

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method):**
   - Compute the prefix sums of the array `nums`. The prefix sum array `prefix_sums` is such that `prefix_sums[i]` contains the sum of the first `i` elements of `nums`.
   - This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray `nums[left]` to `nums[right]` by using the formula: `prefix_sums[right + 1] - prefix_sums[left]`.

2. **Sum Range Query (`sumRange` method):**
   - Use the precomputed prefix sums to calculate the sum of the elements from index `left` to `right` inclusive.
   - Return the computed sum.

### Solution Code
Response: python
class NumArray:

    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to efficiently calculate the sum of elements in a submatrix defined by its upper-left and lower-right corners. The challenge is to achieve this in O(1) time complexity for each query.

### Approach

1. **Precompute Prefix Sums:**
   - We will use a 2D prefix sum array to precompute the sum of all elements from `(0,0)` to `(i,j)` for each cell `(i,j)` in the matrix.
   - This prefix sum array will allow us to calculate the sum of any submatrix in constant time by using inclusion-exclusion principles.

2. **Construct the Prefix Sum Matrix:**
   - Initialize a 2D array `prefix` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)` where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the input matrix.
   - For each cell `(i,j)` in the matrix, compute the prefix sum as:
     \[
     \text{prefix}[i+1][j+1] = \text{matrix}[i][j] + \text{prefix}[i+1][j] + \text{prefix}[i][j+1] - \text{prefix}[i][j]
     \]

3. **Calculate Submatrix Sum:**
   - For a given query with coordinates `(row1, col1)` and `(row2, col2)`, the sum of the submatrix can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \text{prefix}[row2+1][col2+1] - \text{prefix}[row1][col2+1] - \text{prefix}[row2+1][col1] + \text{prefix}[row1][col1]
     \]
   - This formula effectively includes the sum up to `(row2, col2)`, excludes the sums up to `(row1-1, col2)` and `(row2, col1-1)`, and adds back the sum up to `(row1-1, col1-1)` to correct for double exclusion.

Original Question: You are given an empty 2D binary grid `grid` of size `m x n`. The grid represents a map where `0`'s represent water and `1`'s represent land. Initially, all the cells of `grid` are water cells (i.e., all the cells are `0`'s).

We may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land. You are given an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [ri, ci]` is the position `(ri, ci)` at which we should operate the `ith` operation.

Return _an array of integers_ `answer` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the number of islands after turning the cell_ `(ri, ci)` _into a land_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 3, positions = \[\[0,0\],\[0,1\],\[1,2\],\[2,1\]\]
**Output:** \[1,1,2,3\]
**Explanation:**
Initially, the 2d grid is filled with water.
- Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid\[0\]\[0\] into a land. We have 1 island.
- Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid\[0\]\[1\] into a land. We still have 1 island.
- Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid\[1\]\[2\] into a land. We have 2 islands.
- Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid\[2\]\[1\] into a land. We have 3 islands.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 1, n = 1, positions = \[\[0,0\]\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= m, n, positions.length <= 104`
*   `1 <= m * n <= 104`
*   `positions[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= ri < m`
*   `0 <= ci < n`

Return _an array of integers_ `answer` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the number of islands after turning the cell_ `(ri, ci)` _into a land_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 3, positions = \[\[0,0\],\[0,1\],\[1,2\],\[2,1\]\]
**Output:** \[1,1,2,3\]
**Explanation:**
Initially, the 2d grid is filled with water.
- Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid\[0\]\[0\] into a land. We have 1 island.
- Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid\[0\]\[1\] into a land. We still have 1 island.
- Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid\[1\]\[2\] into a land. We have 2 islands.
- Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid\[2\]\[1\] into a land. We have 3 islands.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 1, n = 1, positions = \[\[0,0\]\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= m, n, positions.length <= 104`
*   `1 <= m * n <= 104`
*   `positions[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= ri < m`
*   `0 <= ci < n`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it in time complexity `O(k log(mn))`, where `k == positions.length`?
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to efficiently manage and track the number of islands as we add land cells to the grid. An island is defined as a group of connected land cells, where "connected" means horizontally or vertically adjacent.

### Approach

1. **Union-Find Data Structure**: We'll use the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU) data structure to manage the connectivity of land cells. Each land cell can be considered a node, and when two land cells are adjacent, we can union their sets.

2. **Grid Representation**: Since the grid can be large (up to 10^4 cells), we need an efficient way to represent it. We'll use a 1D array to represent the 2D grid to simplify index management.

3. **Tracking Islands**: As we add each land cell, we check its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If any neighbor is already a land cell, we union the current cell with that neighbor. The number of islands is equal to the number of distinct sets in the Union-Find structure.

4. **Efficiency**: To achieve the desired time complexity of O(k log(mn)), where k is the number of positions, we need to ensure that Union and Find operations are efficient. The Union-Find structure with path compression and union by rank is suitable for this purpose.

Original Question: An **additive number** is a string whose digits can form an **additive sequence**.

A valid **additive sequence** should contain **at least** three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Given a string containing only digits, return `true` if it is an **additive number** or `false` otherwise.

**Note:** Numbers in the additive sequence **cannot** have leading zeros, so sequence `1, 2, 03` or `1, 02, 3` is invalid.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  "112358 "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8

**Example 2:**

**Input:**  "199100199 "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199. 
1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num.length <= 35`
*   `num` consists only of digits.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string of digits can form an additive sequence. An additive sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones. Additionally, numbers in the sequence cannot have leading zeros.

### Approach

1. **Initial Checks**: The string must have at least three digits to form a sequence of at least three numbers.
2. **Iterate through Possible First Two Numbers**:
   - We need to try all possible ways to split the string into the first two numbers.
   - For each pair of first two numbers, generate the sequence and check if it matches the entire string.
3. **Generate Sequence**:
   - Start with the first two numbers and repeatedly add them to form the next number in the sequence.
   - Check if the sequence matches the remaining part of the string.
4. **Handle Leading Zeros**:
   - Ensure that neither of the first two numbers has leading zeros.
   - Ensure that none of the numbers in the sequence has leading zeros.

Implement the `NumArray` class:

CoT: To solve this problem, we need an efficient way to handle range sum queries and updates on an array. A Fenwick Tree (also known as a Binary Indexed Tree) is a data structure that can perform these operations efficiently, with both update and sum operations working in O(log n) time.

### Approach

1. **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
   - Create a Fenwick Tree to store the cumulative sums.
   - Initialize the Fenwick Tree with the given array `nums`.

2. **Update (`update`)**:
   - Update the value at a specific index in the Fenwick Tree.
   - This involves calculating the difference between the new value and the old value and updating the tree accordingly.

3. **Sum Range (`sumRange`)**:
   - Calculate the sum of elements between two indices using the Fenwick Tree.
   - This can be done by getting the prefix sum up to the right index and subtracting the prefix sum up to one position before the left index.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to efficiently handle two types of operations on a 2D matrix: updating the value of a cell and calculating the sum of elements within a specified rectangular region. Given the constraints and the number of operations, we need an efficient way to handle these queries.

### Approach

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method):**
   - We will use a 2D Fenwick Tree (also known as a Binary Indexed Tree) to handle range sum queries and updates efficiently.
   - The Fenwick Tree will be initialized based on the input matrix. Each cell in the Fenwick Tree will store the cumulative sum of a submatrix.

2. **Update Operation (`update` method):**
   - When updating a cell, we need to adjust the Fenwick Tree to reflect the change in value.
   - We calculate the difference between the new value and the old value, then update the Fenwick Tree accordingly.

3. **Sum Region Operation (`sumRegion` method):**
   - To calculate the sum of a rectangular region, we use the Fenwick Tree to compute the prefix sums.
   - We use the inclusion-exclusion principle to get the sum of the specified region.

*   After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[1,2,3,0,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** transactions = \[buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = \[1\]
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= prices.length <= 5000`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`

**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= prices.length <= 5000`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from buying and selling stocks given the prices on different days, with the constraints that we cannot engage in multiple transactions simultaneously and must observe a cooldown period of one day after selling a stock.

### Approach

1. **State Definition**:
   - We define three states to keep track of the maximum profit at each day:
     - `hold`: The maximum profit when holding a stock.
     - `cooldown`: The maximum profit when in cooldown period.
     - `sell`: The maximum profit when selling a stock.

2. **State Transitions**:
   - `hold`: 
     - Either keep holding the previous stock.
     - Or buy a new stock from the cooldown period.
   - `cooldown`:
     - Only when a stock is sold.
   - `sell`:
     - Sell the stock held, transitioning from the `hold` state.

3. **Initialization**:
   - Start with `hold` as negative infinity (or negative of the first price) since no stock is held initially.
   - `cooldown` and `sell` are initialized to 0.

4. **Iteration**:
   - For each day, update the states based on the previous day's states and the current day's price.

5. **Final Result**:
   - The maximum profit will be the maximum of `cooldown` and `sell` states at the end.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def maxProfit(prices):
    if not prices:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize states
    hold = -float('inf')
    cooldown = 0
    sell = 0
    
    for price in prices:
        # Update hold: either keep holding or buy from cooldown
        prev_hold = hold
        hold = max(hold, cooldown - price)
        
        # Update cooldown: cannot do anything, just keep the previous cooldown or sell state
        prev_cooldown = cooldown
        cooldown = max(cooldown, sell)
        
        # Update sell: sell the stock held
        sell = prev_hold + price
    
    # The maximum profit will be the maximum of cooldown and sell
    return max(cooldown, sell)

# Example usage
prices1 = [1,2,3,0,2]

Original Question: A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by _exactly_ one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`) are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs).

Return _a list of all **MHTs'** root labels_. You can return the answer in **any order**.

The **height** of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = \[\[1,0\],\[1,2\],\[1,3\]\]
**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 6, edges = \[\[3,0\],\[3,1\],\[3,2\],\[3,4\],\[5,4\]\]
**Output:** \[3,4\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
*   `edges.length == n - 1`
*   `0 <= ai, bi < n`
*   `ai != bi`
*   All the pairs `(ai, bi)` are distinct.
*   The given input is **guaranteed** to be a tree and there will be **no repeated** edges.

When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`) are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs).

*   The given input is **guaranteed** to be a tree and there will be **no repeated** edges.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the roots of the Minimum Height Trees (MHTs) in a given tree structure. The key idea is to iteratively remove leaves (nodes with only one connection) until we are left with the central nodes, which will be the roots of the MHTs.

### Approach

1. **Graph Construction**: 
   - Represent the tree as an adjacency list.
   - Track the degree (number of connections) of each node.

2. **Identify Leaves**:
   - Initially, collect all nodes with only one connection (leaves).

3. **Trim Leaves Layer by Layer**:
   - Remove these leaves from the graph.
   - Update the degrees of the remaining nodes.
   - Repeat the process until only the central nodes remain.

4. **Termination Condition**:
   - The process stops when there are 1 or 2 nodes left, which are the roots of the MHTs.

CoT: To solve the problem of multiplying two sparse matrices, we need to efficiently handle the multiplication considering that many elements are zero. Sparse matrices are matrices in which most of the elements are zero, and efficient storage and computation methods are used to take advantage of this sparsity.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Sparse Matrices**: Since the matrices are sparse, we should avoid multiplying and adding zeros as much as possible to optimize computation time and resources.

2. **Matrix Multiplication Basics**: The element at the i-th row and j-th column of the resulting matrix is the dot product of the i-th row of the first matrix and the j-th column of the second matrix.

3. **Efficient Computation for Sparse Matrices**: For sparse matrices, we can skip multiplications involving zeros. Specifically:
   - For each row in `mat1`, we can store only the non-zero elements.
   - For each column in `mat2`, we can store only the non-zero elements.
   - Then, for each element in the resulting matrix, we only compute the dot product using the non-zero elements from the corresponding row of `mat1` and column of `mat2`.

4. **Implementation**: We will represent each matrix as a dictionary of dictionaries, where the keys are the indices of non-zero elements.

### Solution Code
Response: python

    m, k, n = len(mat1), len(mat1[0]), len(mat2[0])

Original Question: You are given `n` balloons, indexed from `0` to `n - 1`. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array `nums`. You are asked to burst all the balloons.

If you burst the `ith` balloon, you will get `nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1]` coins. If `i - 1` or `i + 1` goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a `1` painted on it.

Return _the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely_.

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to consider the balloons in a range and find the optimal way to burst them.

### Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We need to maximize the coins obtained by bursting balloons in a specific order.
   - Bursting a balloon gives coins equal to the product of its adjacent balloons (considering 1 if out of bounds).

2. **Insights**:
   - The problem has overlapping subproblems, making dynamic programming suitable.
   - The order in which balloons are burst affects the total coins obtained.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - Use a 2D table `dp` where `dp[left][right]` represents the maximum coins obtainable by bursting balloons from index `left` to `right`.

4. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For each range `(left, right)`, iterate through each balloon `i` in that range and consider bursting it last.
   - The coins obtained by bursting `i` last are: `nums[left-1] * nums[i] * nums[right+1]` plus the coins from bursting balloons in subranges `(left, i-1)` and `(i+1, right)`.

5. **Base Case**:
   - When `left > right`, no balloons to burst, so `dp[left][right] = 0`.

6. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - Fill the table diagonally, starting from subarrays of length 1 up to the entire array.

### Solution Code

def maxCoins(nums):
    n = len(nums)

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to generate the nth super ugly number, where a super ugly number is defined as a positive integer whose prime factors are only from the given array of primes.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We start by initializing a list to hold the sequence of super ugly numbers, starting with the first super ugly number, which is always 1.
   - We also maintain a list of pointers, one for each prime in the primes array, to track the current position in the sequence that each prime is multiplying.

2. **Generating Super Ugly Numbers**:
   - For each new super ugly number beyond the first one, we consider the possible products of each prime with the super ugly numbers up to the position indicated by its pointer.
   - We select the smallest of these possible products as the next super ugly number.
   - We then update the pointers for each prime that could have generated this new super ugly number.

3. **Avoiding Duplicates**:
   - To ensure that each super ugly number is only added once, we need to handle the pointers carefully, advancing the pointers of primes that could have generated the newly added number.

4. **Termination**:
   - We repeat the process until we have generated the nth super ugly number.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def nthSuperUglyNumber(n, primes):
    import heapq

    ugly_numbers = [1]
    pointers = [0] * len(primes)
    heap = []

    while len(ugly_numbers) < n:
        next_ugly = heap[0][0]
        ugly_numbers.append(next_ugly)

        while heap and heap[0][0] == next_ugly:

**Input:** root = \[3,9,20,null,null,15,7\]
**Output:** \[\[9\],\[3,15\],\[20\],\[7\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[3,9,8,4,0,1,7\]
**Output:** \[\[4\],\[9\],\[3,0,1\],\[8\],\[7\]\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = \[3,9,8,4,0,1,7,null,null,null,2,5\]
**Output:** \[\[4\],\[9,5\],\[3,0,1\],\[8,2\],\[7\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to perform a vertical order traversal of a binary tree. This means that we should collect nodes based on their vertical columns, from top to bottom and left to right.

### Approach

1. **Track Columns:** We'll assign a column index to each node. The root is at column 0, left children are at column-1, and right children are at column+1.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** We'll use BFS to traverse the tree level by level, keeping track of each node's column index.
3. **Collect Nodes by Column:** Use a dictionary to collect all nodes based on their column indices.
4. **Sort Columns:** Finally, collect the nodes from the dictionary in the order of their column indices.

### Solution Code
Response: python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def verticalOrder(root):
    if not root:
        return []
    
    # Dictionary to hold column index to list of nodes
    column_table = defaultdict(list)
    # Queue for BFS, each element is (node, column_index)
    queue = deque([(root, 0)])
    
    while queue:
        node, column = queue.popleft()
        if node:
            column_table[column].append(node.val)
            queue.append((node.left, column - 1))
            queue.append((node.right, column + 1))
    
    # Extract the columns in order
    return [column_table[key] for key in sorted(column_table)]

# Example usage:
# Construct the tree: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
root = TreeNode(3)
root.left = TreeNode(9)
root.right = TreeNode(20)
root.right.left = TreeNode(15)
root.right.right = TreeNode(7)

print(verticalOrder(root))  # Output: [[9], [3, 15], [20], [7]]

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums`, return _an integer array_ `counts` _where_ `counts[i]` _is the number of smaller elements to the right of_ `nums[i]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[5,2,6,1\]
**Output:** \[2,1,1,0\]
**Explanation:**
To the right of 5 there are **2** smaller elements (2 and 1).
To the right of 2 there is only **1** smaller element (1).
To the right of 6 there is **1** smaller element (1).
To the right of 1 there is **0** smaller element.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[-1\]
**Output:** \[0\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[-1,-1\]
**Output:** \[0,0\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find, for each element in the array, how many elements to its right are smaller than it. This can be efficiently achieved using a modified merge sort algorithm, which allows us to count the number of smaller elements during the merge step.

### Approach

1. **Pairing Indices and Values:** We will pair each element with its original index to keep track of its position.
2. **Merge Sort with Counting:** During the merge step of the merge sort, we will count the number of elements that are smaller and to the right of the current element.

### Solution Code

def countSmaller(nums):
    def sort(enum):
        half = len(enum) // 2
        if half:
            left, right = sort(enum[:half]), sort(enum[half:])
            m, n = len(left), len(right)

                    j += 1
        return enum

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to remove duplicate letters from a string while ensuring that the resulting string contains each letter only once and is the smallest possible in lexicographical order. This means we have to be strategic about the order in which we include letters, considering both their alphabetical order and their frequency in the original string.

### Approach

1. **Count Frequency**: First, we need to know the frequency of each character in the string. This will help us decide whether it's safe to remove a character because it appears later in the string.

2. **Greedy Selection**: We'll use a greedy algorithm to build the smallest possible string. We'll iterate through the string and decide at each step whether to include the current character based on whether it's smaller than the characters already included and whether those characters can be included later.

3. **Tracking Used Characters**: To ensure each character is included only once, we'll keep track of the characters that have already been included in the result.

4. **Stack Data Structure**: We'll use a stack to build the result efficiently. The stack allows us to add and remove characters easily as we iterate through the string.

### Solution Code
Response: python
def removeDuplicateLetters(s: str) -> str:
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Count the frequency of each character in the string
    count = Counter(s)
    
    # Stack to build the result
    stack = []
    
    # Set to track characters that are already in the stack
    in_stack = set()
    
    for char in s:
        # Decrease the count of the current character
        count[char] -= 1
        
        # If the character is already in the stack, skip it
        if char in in_stack:
            continue
        
        # While the stack is not empty, the current character is smaller than the top of the stack,
        # and there are more instances of the top character later in the string
        while stack and char < stack[-1] and count[stack[-1]] > 0:
            # Remove the top character from the stack and the set
            in_stack.remove(stack.pop())
        
        # Add the current character to the stack and the set
        stack.append(char)
        in_stack.add(char)
    
    # Return the result as a string
    return ''.join(stack)
