Original Question: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,7,11,15\], target = 9
**Output:** \[0,1\]
**Explanation:** Because nums\[0\] + nums\[1\] == 9, we return \[0, 1\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,4\], target = 6
**Output:** \[1,2\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,3\], target = 6
**Output:** \[0,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `-109 <= target <= 109`
*   **Only one valid answer exists.**

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?

CoT: To solve the problem of finding two numbers in an array that add up to a given target, we can use a two-pointer approach. This approach works by sorting the array and then using two pointers to find the pair of numbers that add up to the target.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Sort the array**: This ensures that the numbers are in ascending order, which will help us find the pair more efficiently.
2. ** Initialize two pointers**: One pointer, `left`, starts at the beginning of the array, and the other pointer, `right`, starts at the end of the array.
3. ** Iterate until the pointers meet**: In each iteration, we check if the sum of the numbers at the `left` and `right` pointers is equal to the target.
   - If the sum is equal to the target, we have found the pair. We return the indices of these two numbers.
   - If the sum is less than the target, we move the `left` pointer to the right to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is greater than the target, we move the `right` pointer to the left to decrease the sum.
4. **Continue until the pointers meet**: We repeat this process until the `left` and `right` pointers meet. If they meet and we have not found a pair, it means there is no pair in the array that adds up to the target.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    # Step 1: Sort the array
    nums.sort()

    # Step 2: Initialize two pointers
    left = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1

    # Step 3: Iterate until the pointers meet
    while left < right:
        # Check if the sum is equal to the target
        if nums[left] + nums[right] == target:
            return [left, right]
        # Move the left pointer to the right
        elif nums[left] + nums[right] < target:
            left += 1
        # Move the right pointer to the left
        else:
            right -= 1

    # Step 4: Continue until the pointers meet
    return []

**Example 1:**

**Input:** l1 = \[2,4,3\], l2 = \[5,6,4\]

CoT: To solve the problem of adding two numbers represented by linked lists in Python, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert the linked lists to integers**: Since the digits are in reverse order, we can convert each linked list to an integer by iterating through the list and multiplying each digit by the appropriate power of 10.
2. **Add the integers**: Once we have the integers, we simply add them together.
3. **Convert the sum back to a linked list**: We need to convert the sum back to a linked list by repeatedly dividing the sum by 10 and storing the remainders in a new linked list.

Here is the Python code that implements these steps:

CoT: To find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string `s`, we can use a two-pointer approach. This approach involves maintaining a sliding window that expands and contracts as we iterate through the string.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize Pointers and Variables:**
   - Set two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the string.
   - Use a dictionary to keep track of the last position of each character encountered.
   - Initialize a variable `max_length` to 0 to store the length of the longest substring found.

2. **Iterate Through the String:**
   - Move the `right` pointer to the right, one character at a time.
   - For each character, check if it is already in the current substring (i.e., if it is in the dictionary and its last position is within the current substring).
   - If the character is in the current substring, move the `left` pointer to the right of its last position.
   - Update the last position of the character in the dictionary.
   - Calculate the length of the current substring (i.e., `right - left + 1`).
   - Update `max_length` if the current substring is longer.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - After iterating through the entire string, return `max_length`.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
def length_of_longest_substring(s):
    left = 0
    right = 0
    last_position = {}
    max_length = 0

    while right < len(s):
        if s[right] in last_position and last_position[s[right]] >= left:
            left = last_position[s[right]] + 1
        last_position[s[right]] = right
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
        right += 1

    return max_length

# Example usage
s = "abcabcbb"
print(length_of_longest_substring(s))  # Output: 3

s = "bbbbb"
print(length_of_longest_substring(s))  # Output: 1

s = "pwwkew"

Original Question: Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return **the median** of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,3\], nums2 = \[2\]
**Output:** 2.00000

*   `-106 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 106`
CoT: To find the median of two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` with a time complexity of `O(log (m+n))`, we can use a binary search approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Determine the total number of elements**: Let `m` be the length of `nums1` and `n` be the length of `nums2`. The total number of elements in the merged array is `m + n`.

2. **Find the median position**: The median position in the merged array can be calculated as:
   - If `m + n` is odd, the median is at position \(\left\lfloor \frac{m+n}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\).
   - If `m + n` is even, the median is the average of the elements at positions \(\left\lfloor \frac{m+n}{2} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m+n}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\).

3. **Binary search for the median**: We can use binary search to find the median by comparing elements from both arrays. We need to find an index `i` in `nums1` and an index `j` in `nums2` such that:
   - `i + j = \left\lfloor \frac{m+n}{2} \right\rfloor` (for odd total elements)
   - `i + j = \left\lfloor \frac{m+n}{2} \right\rfloor` or `i + j = \left\lfloor \frac{m+n}{2} \right\rfloor + 1` (for even total elements)

4. **Compare elements**: At each step of the binary search, compare the elements at the current indices `i` and `j`:
   - If `nums1[i] < nums2[j]`, then the median must be in the right half of `nums1` or the left half of `nums2`.
   - If `nums1[i] > nums2[j]`, then the median must be in the left half of `nums1` or the right half of `nums2`.
   - If `nums1[i] = nums2[j]`, then this element is the median.

5. ** adjust indices**: Based on the comparison, adjust the indices `i` and `j` accordingly and repeat the binary search until we find the median.

Here's the Python code to implement this approach:
Response: python
def findMedian(A, B):
    m, n = len(A), len(B)
    if m > n:
        A, B = B, A
    left, right = 0, m
    while left <= right:
        i = (left + right) // 2
        j = (m + n) // 2 - i
        if i < m and B[j-1] > A[i]:
            left = i + 1
        elif i > 0 and A[i-1] > B[j]:
            right = i - 1
        else:

CoT: To solve the problem of reversing a signed 32-bit integer `x` without using 64-bit integers, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the sign of `x`.
2. Convert `x` to its absolute value.
3. Reverse the digits of the absolute value.
4. Convert the reversed digits back to a signed integer.
5. Check if the reversed integer is within the 32-bit integer range. If it is outside the range, return 0.

Here is the Python code that implements these steps:
Response: python
def reverse signed_int(x):
    # Determine the sign of x
    sign = 1 if x >= 0 else -1
    
    # Convert x to its absolute value
    abs_x = abs(x)
    
    # Reverse the digits of the absolute value
    reversed_abs_x = int(str(abs_x)[::-1])
    
    # Convert the reversed digits back to a signed integer
    reversed_x = sign * reversed_abs_x
    
    # Check if the reversed integer is within the 32-bit integer range
    if reversed_x < -2**31 or reversed_x > 2**31 - 1:
        return 0
    
    return reversed_x

# Example usage
print(reverse_signed_int(123))  # Output: 321
print(reverse_signed_int(-123))  # Output: -321
print(reverse_signed_int(120))  # Output: 21
print(reverse_signed_int(1234567890))  # Output: 0 (since it exceeds the 32-bit integer range)

Original Question: Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1.  Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
2.  Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
3.  Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
4.  Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `"123 " -> 123`, `"0032 " -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
5.  If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.
6.  Return the integer as the final result.

**Note:**

*   Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.
*   **Do not ignore** any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "42 "
**Output:** 42
**Explanation:** The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1:  "42 " (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2:  "42 " (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3:  "42 " ( "42 " is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is 42.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "   -42 "
**Output:** -42
**Explanation:**
Step 1:  "   \-42 " (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2:  "   \-42 " ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3:  "   -42 " ( "42 " is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is -42.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "4193 with words "
**Output:** 4193
**Explanation:**
Step 1:  "4193 with words " (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2:  "4193 with words " (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3:  "4193 with words " ( "4193 " is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.
Since 4193 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is 4193.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length <= 200`
*   `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (`0-9`), `' '`, `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'.'`.
Attacked Question: Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

2.  Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
3.  Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
4.  Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `"123 " -> 123`, `"0032 " -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
5.  If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.
6.  Return the integer as the final result.

           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is 42.

**Example 2:**

Step 1:  "   \-42 " (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^

Original Question: Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where:

*   `'.'` Matches any single character.​​​​
*   `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "aa ", p =  "a "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:**  "a " does not match the entire string  "aa ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "aa ", p =  "a\* "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** '\*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes  "aa ".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "ab ", p =  ".\* "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**  ".\* " means  "zero or more (\*) of any character (.) ".

*   `1 <= p.length <= 20`
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
*   `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'.'`, and `'*'`.
*   It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character `'*'`, there will be a previous valid character to match.

*   It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character `'*'`, there will be a previous valid character to match.
CoT: To solve the problem of regular expression matching with support for ` '.' ` and ` *' ` in Python, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will create a 2D boolean array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the first `i` characters of the string `s` match the first `j` characters of the pattern `p`.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize the 2D array `dp` with `dp[0][0] = True` because an empty pattern matches an empty string.
2. Fill in the first row of `dp` to handle the case where the pattern starts with ` *' `.
3. Fill in the rest of the `dp` array by considering the current characters of `s` and `p` and the previous states.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def is_match(s, p):
    m = len(s)
    n = len(p)
    dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = True

    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if p[j - 1] == '*':

    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if p[j - 1] == '.' or p[j - 1] == s[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            elif p[j - 1] == '*':
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] or dp[i - 1][j]

Original Question: You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the two lines that form a container with the maximum amount of water, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. ** Initialize Pointers:**
   - Place one pointer at the beginning of the array (left) and another at the end of the array (right).

2. ** Calculate Area:**
   - The area of the container formed by the two lines and the x-axis is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{width} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - The width of the container is the distance between the two pointers, which is \( \text{right} - \text{left} \).
   - The height of the container is the minimum height of the two lines at the current positions of the pointers.

3. ** Update Pointers:**
   - Move the pointer that points to the shorter line towards the other pointer. This is because moving the pointer with the higher line would not increase the height of the container and would only decrease the width, potentially reducing the area.

4. ** Update Maximum Area:**
   - After each move, calculate the new area and update the maximum area found so far.

5. ** Repeat:**
   - Continue this process until the two pointers meet.

Here is the Python code implementing this algorithm:
Response: python
def max_water_container(height):
    left = 0
    right = len(height) - 1
    max_area = 0

    while left < right:

        area = width * height_min
        max_area = max(max_area, area)

        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1

Original Question: Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

**Symbol**       **Value**
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

*   `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
*   `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
*   `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

CoT: To convert an integer to a Roman numeral, we need to understand the rules of Roman numerals. Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: I (1), V (5), X (10), L (50), C (100), D (500), and M (1000). The numerals are written largest to smallest from left to right, but there are specific rules for subtraction. A smaller numeral placed before a larger numeral means subtraction. This happens for the pairs (I, V), (I, X), (X, L), (X, C), (C, D), and (C, M).

We can solve this problem by using a greedy algorithm. We start with the largest Roman numeral and subtract it from the given number as many times as possible until the number is reduced to zero. We then move to the next largest Roman numeral and repeat the process until the number is completely converted.

Here is the step-by-step Python code to convert an integer to a Roman numeral:

1. Define a dictionary to map each Roman numeral to its value.
2. Initialize an empty string to store the Roman numeral.
3. Iterate over the Roman numerals in descending order.

Original Question: Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

**Symbol**       **Value**
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

*   `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
*   `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
*   `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "III "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** III = 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "LVIII "
**Output:** 58
**Explanation:** L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "MCMXCIV "
**Output:** 1994
**Explanation:** M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 15`
*   `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.
*   It is **guaranteed** that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.

CoT: To convert a Roman numeral to an integer, we need to consider the subtractive notation used in Roman numerals. We will iterate through the Roman numeral from left to right and check if the current symbol is smaller than the next symbol. If it is, we subtract its value from the next symbol's value and add the result to our total. Otherwise, we simply add the current symbol's value to our total.

Here is the Python code to perform the conversion:
Response: python
def roman_to_integer(s):
    # Create a dictionary to map Roman numerals to their integer values
    roman_values = {
        'I': 1,
        'V': 5,
        'X': 10,
        'L': 50,
        'C': 100,
        'D': 500,
        'M': 1000
    }
    
    # Initialize the total integer value
    total = 0
    
    # Iterate through the Roman numeral string
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Get the value of the current symbol
        current_value = roman_values[s[i]]
        
        # If the current symbol is smaller than the next symbol, subtract its value
        if i < len(s) - 1 and current_value < roman_values[s[i + 1]]:
            total -= current_value
        else:
            total += current_value
    
    return total

# Example usage

Original Question: Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[-1,0,1,2,-1,-4\]
**Output:** \[\[-1,-1,2\],\[-1,0,1\]\]
**Explanation:** 
nums\[0\] + nums\[1\] + nums\[2\] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums\[1\] + nums\[2\] + nums\[4\] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums\[0\] + nums\[3\] + nums\[4\] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are \[-1,0,1\] and \[-1,-1,2\].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,1\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,0,0\]

*   `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding all unique triplets in an integer array `nums` that sum up to 0, we can use a combination of sorting and the two-pointer technique. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Sort the array**: Sorting the array helps us to easily avoid duplicate triplets and also makes it easier to use the two-pointer technique.
2. **Iterate through the array**: We iterate through the array with a loop, and for each element `nums[i]`, we need to find two other elements `nums[j]` and `nums[k]` such that `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] = 0`. This can be rewritten as `nums[j] + nums[k] = -nums[i]`.
3. **Use two-pointers**: For each `i`, we set two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the beginning and end of the remaining part of the array (from `i+1` to the end). We then move these pointers towards each other until they meet, checking if the sum of `nums[left]` and `nums[right]` equals `-nums[i]`.
4. **Add triplets to the result**: If `nums[left] + nums[right] = -nums[i]`, we add the triplet \([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]}\) to our result. We then move the pointers to the next elements, skipping any duplicates.
5. **Continue the process**: We repeat this process until we have iterated through all elements in the array.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def threeSum(nums):
    nums.sort()
    result = []
    n = len(nums)
    
    for i in range(n):
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
            continue  # Skip duplicates

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`.

*   `-104 <= target <= 104`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding three integers in an array `nums` such that their sum is closest to a given `target`, we can use a three-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Sort the array**: First, we sort the array `nums` in ascending order. This allows us to use the two-pointer technique effectively.

2. **Iterate through the array**: We iterate through the array with a loop, where the current element is denoted as `nums[i]`. For each `i`, we use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to find the other two elements that, when added to `nums[i]`, give a sum closest to `target`.

3. **Use two pointers**: Initialize `left` to `i + 1` and `right` to `n - 1` (the end of the array). Then, we move the pointers based on the sum of the three elements:
   - If the sum is less than `target`, we move `left` to the right to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is greater than `target`, we move `right` to the left to decrease the sum.
   - If the sum is equal to `target`, we return the sum immediately.

4. **Update the closest sum**: For each iteration, we calculate the absolute difference between the current sum and the target. If this difference is smaller than the previous closest difference, we update the closest sum.

5. **Return the closest sum**: After iterating through the array, we return the closest sum found.

Here is the Python code implementing this solution:
Response: python
def threeSum closestToTarget(nums, target):
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    closest_sum = float('inf')

        right = n - 1
        
        while left < right:
            current_sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
            current_difference = abs(current_sum - target)
            
            if current_difference < closest_sum:
                closest_sum = current_difference
                closest_triple = (nums[i], nums[left], nums[right])

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all unique quadruplets in an array `nums` that sum up to a given target, we can use a combination of sorting and a four-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Sort the array**: Sorting the array helps us to easily avoid duplicate quadruplets and also makes it easier to use the four-pointer approach.

2. **Use four pointers**: We will use four pointers, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, to find the quadruplets. We start with `a` at the beginning of the array, `b` at `a+1`, `c` at `b+1`, and `d` at `c+1`. We then move these pointers around to find all possible quadruplets that sum up to the target.

3. **Check the sum**: For each combination of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, we check if `nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d]` equals the target. If it does, we add the quadruplet to our result list. If it is less than the target, we move `d` to the right. If it is greater than the target, we move `c` to the right.

4. **Avoid duplicates**: To avoid duplicate quadruplets, we ensure that each quadruplet is unique. This is done by checking if the current quadruplet is the same as the previous quadruplet before adding it to the result list. We also move the pointers so that they do not revisit the same elements.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
def fourSum(nums, target):
    nums.sort()
    result = []
    n = len(nums)
    
    for a in range(n):
        if a > 0 and nums[a] == nums[a-1]:
            continue
        for b in range(a+1, n):
            if b > a+1 and nums[b] == nums[b-1]:
                continue
            for c in range(b+1, n):
                if c > b+1 and nums[c] == nums[c-1]:
                    continue
                d = 3*n - 2 - (a + b + c)
                while d > c and d >= 0:
                    if nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d] == target:
                        result.append([nums[a], nums[b], nums[c], nums[d]])
                        d -= 1
                    elif nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d] < target:
                        d -= 1

CoT: To solve the problem of removing the `nth` node from the end of a linked list in Python, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: Create two pointers, `first` and `second`, both starting at the head of the list.
2. **Move the First Pointers**: Move the `first` pointer `n` steps forward. This ensures that when the `second` pointer reaches the end of the list, the `first` pointer is at the `n`th node from the end.
3. **Move the Second Pointers**: Move both the `first` and `second` pointers together until the `second` pointer reaches the end of the list. This means the `first` pointer will be at the `n`th node from the end.
4. **Remove the Node**: Once the `second` pointer reaches the end, remove the node pointed to by the `first` pointer.
5. **Return the Head**: Return the head of the list.

For each closing bracket encountered, we check if the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket. If either condition is true, the string is not valid. If we finish iterating through the string and the stack is empty, the string is valid.

CoT: To merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted list, we can use a two-pointer approach. We'll create a new list and iterate through both input lists, adding the smaller value between the two current nodes to the new list and moving to the next node in the list from which the value was taken. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize two pointers, ` pointer1` and ` pointer2`, to the heads of ` list1` and ` list2` respectively.
2. Create a new list and a pointer to the head of this new list, ` new pointer`.
3. While both ` pointer1` and ` pointer2` are not None:
   - If the value at ` pointer1` is less than or equal to the value at ` pointer2`, add the value at ` pointer1` to the new list and move ` pointer1` to the next node.
   - Otherwise, add the value at ` pointer2` to the new list and move ` pointer2` to the next node.
4. If ` pointer1` is None, add all the remaining nodes from ` list2` to the new list.
5. If ` pointer2` is None, add all the remaining nodes from ` list1` to the new list.
6. Return the head of the new list.

1. **Initialize a min-heap**: We will use a min-heap to store the smallest elements from each list. The heap will be implemented using a list where the ` heappush` and `heappop` operations will be used to add and remove the smallest elements, respectively.

2. **Add the first elements of each list to the heap**: Iterate through each list and add the first element of the list to the heap. Also, keep track of the index of the element in its respective list.

3. **Merge the lists**: While the heap is not empty, do the following:
   - Pop the smallest element from the heap.
   - Add this element to the result list.
   - If there is a next element in the list from which the smallest element was taken, add it to the heap.

CoT: To solve the problem of reversing the nodes of a linked list `k` at a time, we can follow these steps:

1. **Define the function to reverse a portion of the list:**
   - We need a function that takes the head of a portion of the list and returns the head of the reversed portion.
   - This can be done using a simple iterative approach where we keep track of the previous and next nodes while reversing the links.

2. **Iterate through the list in steps of `k`:**
   - We start from the head of the list and move in steps of `k` until we reach the end.
   - For each step, we reverse the portion of the list from the current node to the node `k` steps ahead.
   - After reversing each portion, we update the head of the list to the next node after the reversed portion.

3. **Handle the remaining nodes if the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k`:**

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**. Then return _the number of unique elements in_ `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

*   Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
*   Return `k`.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array
int\[\] expectedNums = \[...\]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums\[i\] == expectedNums\[i\];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,2\]
**Output:** 2, nums = \[1,2,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4\]
**Output:** 5, nums = \[0,1,2,3,4,\_,\_,\_,\_,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
*   `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

*   `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
CoT: To solve the problem of removing duplicates from a sorted array in place and returning the number of unique elements, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: We start with two pointers, `i` and `j`. The pointer `i` is used to iterate through the array, and the pointer `j` is used to keep track of the position where the next unique element should be placed.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**: We iterate through the array with the pointer `i`. For each element at position `i`, we compare it with the element at position `j-1` (which is the previous unique element).

3. **Update Pointers**: If the element at position `i` is different from the element at position `j-1`, it means we have found a new unique element. In this case, we move the pointer `j` to the right and place the element at position `i` at position `j`.

4. **Return the Number of Unique Elements**: After iterating through the entire array, the value of `j` will be the number of unique elements in the array. This is because `j` keeps track of the position where the next unique element should be placed, and when we reach the end of the array, `j` will be at the position of the last unique element.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def remove duplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    j = 1
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i]!= nums[j-1]:
            nums[j] = nums[i]
            j += 1

    return j

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the first occurrence of a needle in a haystack, we can use Python's built-in `str.index()` method. This method returns the index of the first occurrence of a given substring in a string. If the substring is not found, it returns -1.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Define the function `first_occurrence` that takes two arguments: `haystack` and `needle`.
2. Use the `str.index()` method to find the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`.
3. If the method returns a value, that value is the index of the first occurrence. If it returns -1, then `needle` is not part of `haystack`.
4. Return the result.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def first_occurrence(haystack, needle):
    index = haystack.index(needle)
    return index

# Example usage
haystack1 = "sadyutsad"
needle1 = "sad"

Original Question: Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide two integers **without** using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, `8.345` would be truncated to `8`, and `-2.7335` would be truncated to `-2`.

Return _the **quotient** after dividing_ `dividend` _by_ `divisor`.

**Note:** Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the **32-bit** signed integer range: `[-231, 231 - 1]`. For this problem, if the quotient is **strictly greater than** `231 - 1`, then return `231 - 1`, and if the quotient is **strictly less than** `-231`, then return `-231`.

**Example 1:**

CoT: To solve the problem of dividing two integers without using multiplication, division, or mod operators, we can use a method that involves repeated subtraction. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine the sign of the quotient:**
   - If both `dividend` and `divisor` have the same sign (both positive or both negative), the quotient will be positive.
   - If `dividend` and `divisor` have different signs, the quotient will be negative.

2. **Convert the integers to their absolute values:**
   - This allows us to work with positive numbers, simplifying the subtraction process.

3. **Perform repeated subtraction:**
   - Subtract the absolute value of `divisor` from the absolute value of `dividend` until the result is less than the absolute value of `divisor`.
   - Count the number of subtractions performed.

4. **Determine the final quotient:**
   - If the original signs of `dividend` and `divisor` were the same, the quotient is the count of subtractions.
   - If the original signs were different, the quotient is the negative of the count of subtractions.

5. ** handle overflow:**
   - If the quotient is greater than `231 - 1`, return `231 - 1`.
   - If the quotient is less than `-231`, return `-231`.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def integer_division(dividend, divisor):
    # Determine the sign of the quotient
    sign = -1 if (dividend < 0)!= (divisor < 0) else 1

    # Convert the integers to their absolute values
    dividend_abs = abs(dividend)
    divisor_abs = abs(divisor)

    # Perform repeated subtraction
    quotient = 0
    while dividend_abs >= divisor_abs:
        dividend_abs -= divisor_abs
        quotient += 1

    # Determine the final quotient
    quotient = sign * quotient

Original Question: You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of `words` are of **the same length**.

A **concatenated substring** in `s` is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of `words` concatenated.

*   For example, if `words = [ "ab ", "cd ", "ef "]`, then `"abcdef "`, `"abefcd "`, `"cdabef "`, `"cdefab "`, `"efabcd "`, and `"efcdab "` are all concatenated strings. `"acdbef "` is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of `words`.

Return _the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in_ `s`. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "barfoothefoobarman ", words = \[ "foo ", "bar "\]
**Output:** \[0,9\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 2 and words\[i\].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.
The substring starting at 0 is  "barfoo ". It is the concatenation of \[ "bar ", "foo "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is  "foobar ". It is the concatenation of \[ "foo ", "bar "\] which is a permutation of words.
The output order does not matter. Returning \[9,0\] is fine too.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword ", words = \[ "word ", "good ", "best ", "word "\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 4 and words\[i\].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.
There is no substring of length 16 is s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.
We return an empty array.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "barfoofoobarthefoobarman ", words = \[ "bar ", "foo ", "the "\]
**Output:** \[6,9,12\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 3 and words\[i\].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 9.
The substring starting at 6 is  "foobarthe ". It is the concatenation of \[ "foo ", "bar ", "the "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is  "barthefoo ". It is the concatenation of \[ "bar ", "the ", "foo "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 12 is  "thefoobar ". It is the concatenation of \[ "the ", "foo ", "bar "\] which is a permutation of words.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 104`
*   `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
*   `s` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.

The substring starting at 12 is  "thefoobar ". It is the concatenation of \[ "the ", "foo ", "bar "\] which is a permutation of words.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
*   `s` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding all starting indices of concatenated substrings in the string `s` that contain all the strings of any permutation of `words`, we can use a combination of string manipulation and a hash map to check if a given substring is a permutation of the words.

Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. **Calculate the total length of the concatenated string:**
   Since each word in `words` has the same length, the total length of the concatenated string is `words length * word length`.

2. **Create a frequency map for the words:**
   Create a frequency map (or dictionary) to count the occurrences of each word in `words`.

3. **Iterate through the string `s` and check for concatenated substrings:**
   Iterate through `s` with a window of size equal to the total length of the concatenated string. For each window, check if the substring of `s` within the window is a permutation of the words.

4. **Check if a substring is a permutation:**
   To check if a substring is a permutation, compare the frequency map of the words in `words` with the frequency map of the words in the substring. If the frequency maps are the same, the substring is a permutation.

5. **Add the starting index to the result if the substring is a permutation:**
   If the substring is a permutation, add the starting index of the window to the result.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python

Original Question: A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

*   For example, for `arr = [1,2,3]`, the following are all the permutations of `arr`: `[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]`.

The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

*   For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.
*   Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.
*   While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers `nums`, _find the next permutation of_ `nums`.

The replacement must be **[in place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** and use only constant extra memory.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** \[1,3,2\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,1\]
**Output:** \[1,2,3\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,5\]
**Output:** \[1,5,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`
CoT: To find the next permutation of an array in place, we can follow these steps:

1. **Find the first element from the right that is smaller than its next element.** This element is the pivot.
2. **Find the smallest element to the right of the pivot that is greater than the pivot.** Swap this element with the pivot.
3. **Reverse the segment of the array to the right of the pivot.**

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
def next_permutation(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Step 1: Find the pivot
    pivot = n - 2
    while pivot >= 0 and nums[pivot] >= nums[pivot + 1]:
        pivot -= 1
    
    # If no pivot is found, the array is already in descending order
    if pivot == -1:
        nums.reverse()
        return
    
    # Step 2: Find the smallest element to the right of the pivot that is greater than the pivot
    next_greater = n - 1
    while nums[next_greater] <= nums[pivot]:
        next_greater -= 1
    
    # Swap the pivot with the next greater element
    nums[pivot], nums[next_greater] = nums[next_greater], nums[pivot]
    
    # Step 3: Reverse the segment to the right of the pivot
    nums[pivot + 1:] = nums[pivot + 1:][::-1]
    
    return

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3]
next_permutation(nums)
print(nums)  # Output: [1, 3, 2]

nums = [3, 2, 1]
next_permutation(nums)
print(nums)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]

nums = [1, 1, 5]
next_permutation(nums)
print(nums)  # Output: [1, 5, 1]

*   `s[i]` is `'('`, or `')'`.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the length of the longest valid parentheses substring in a given string, we can use a stack to keep track of the positions of the parentheses. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a stack and a variable `max_length` to keep track of the maximum length of the valid parentheses substring.
2. Iterate through the string from left to right.
3. If the current character is an opening parenthesis `('`, push its index onto the stack.
4. If the current character is a closing parenthesis `')`, check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is an opening parenthesis. If so,弹出 the top of the stack and calculate the length of the valid parentheses substring formed by the current index and the top of the stack. Update `max_length` if this length is greater than the current `max_length`.
5. If the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not an opening parenthesis, push the current index onto the stack.
6. After iterating through the entire string, return `max_length`.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def longest_valid_parentheses(s):
    stack = []
    max_length = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            stack.append(i)
        elif s[i] == ')':
            if stack:
                top = stack.pop()
                length = i - top
                max_length = max(max_length, length)
    return max_length

# Example usage

s = "})()())
print(longest_valid_parentheses(s))  # Output: 4

Original Question: There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return _the index of_ `target` _if it is in_ `nums`_, or_ `-1` _if it is not in_ `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,6,7,0,1,2\], target = 0
**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,6,7,0,1,2\], target = 3
**Output:** -1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1\], target = 0
**Output:** -1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
*   All values of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
*   `-104 <= target <= 104`

*   All values of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
*   `-104 <= target <= 104`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a modified binary search algorithm. The key observation is that after a rotation, the array can be divided into two parts: one part is sorted in ascending order, and the other part is also sorted in ascending order. We can use this property to find the target value in the array.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Find the pivot index**: The pivot index `k` is the index where the array is rotated. We can find `k` by comparing the first and last elements of the array. If the first element is greater than the last element, then the array is rotated at some index `k` such that `k > 0`. Otherwise, the array is not rotated (i.e., `k = 0`).

2. **Perform binary search**: Once we have the pivot index `k`, we can perform a binary search on the array to find the target value. We need to consider two cases:
   - If the target value is in the first part of the array (i.e., between `nums[0]` and `nums[k-1]`), we perform binary search on this part.
   - If the target value is in the second part of the array (i.e., between `nums[k]` and `nums[n-1]`), we perform binary search on this part.

3. **Return the result**: If the target value is found, return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def find_pivot_index(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    left, right = 0, n-1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

            left = mid + 1

    return left

            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1

        return binary_search(nums, target, pivot_index, n-1)
    else:

**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Same as Example 1, except with the **5** in the top left corner being modified to **8**. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

**Constraints:**

*   `board.length == 9`
*   `board[i].length == 9`
*   `board[i][j]` is a digit `1-9` or `'.'`.
CoT: To determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid, we need to check three conditions for each row, column, and `3 x 3` sub-box:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

We can implement this by iterating over each row, column, and sub-box and checking if the digits `1-9` appear exactly once in each.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

    # Check rows

    for col in range(9):
        if len(set(board[row][col] for row in range(9)))!= 9:
            return False

    # Check sub-boxes

            if len(set(sub_box))!= 9:
                return False

    return True

CoT: To solve the Sudoku puzzle, we can use a backtracking algorithm. The algorithm works by iterating through each cell in the grid and trying to fill it with a digit from 1 to 9. If a digit can be placed in a cell without violating the Sudoku rules, the algorithm moves to the next cell. If a digit cannot be placed in a cell, the algorithm backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different digit.

Original Question: The **count-and-say** sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

*   `countAndSay(1) = "1 "`
*   `countAndSay(n)` is the way you would "say " the digit string from `countAndSay(n-1)`, which is then converted into a different digit string.

To determine how you "say " a digit string, split it into the **minimal** number of substrings such that each substring contains exactly **one** unique digit. Then for each substring, say the number of digits, then say the digit. Finally, concatenate every said digit.

For example, the saying and conversion for digit string `"3322251 "`:

Given a positive integer `n`, return _the_ `nth` _term of the **count-and-say** sequence_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 1

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the `n`th term of the **count-and-say** sequence, we can use a recursive approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Base Case**: If `n` is 1, return "1 ".
2. **Recursive Step**: For `n > 1`, we need to generate the `n`th term by saying the digits of the `(n-1)`th term. To do this, we iterate through the `(n-1)`th term and count the number of consecutive digits. For each count, we append the count and the digit to the result.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:

def count_and_say(n):
    if n == 1:
        return "1 "
    
    previous_term = count_and_say(n-1)

The **same** number may be chosen from `candidates` an **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** candidates = \[2,3,6,7\], target = 7
**Output:** \[\[2,2,3\],\[7\]\]

2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to generate all unique combinations of `candidates` that sum up to `target`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Define the recursive function**: We'll define a function `find_combinations` that takes the current combination, the current index in the `candidates` array, and the remaining target sum as parameters.

2. **Base case**: If the remaining target sum is 0, we have found a valid combination. Add the current combination to the result list.

3. **Recursive case**: For each candidate at the current index, if the candidate is less than or equal to the remaining target sum, add it to the current combination and make a recursive call with the updated combination, the next index, and the reduced remaining target sum.

4. ** Avoid duplicates**: To ensure that we only get unique combinations, we can pass the current index as the second parameter to the recursive function. This way, we can skip adding the same candidate again if it has already been added in a previous level of recursion.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def find_combinations(candidates, target):
    result = []
    current_combination = []
    find_combinations_recursive(candidates, target, 0, current_combination, result)

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
CoT: To find the smallest missing positive integer in an unsorted integer array `nums` in `O(n)` time and using constant extra space, we can use the following algorithm:

1. **Iterate through the array and mark the presence of positive integers:**
   - Initialize a variable `n` to store the length of the array.
   - Iterate through each element `num` in the array.
   - If `num` is positive and within the range \([1, n]\), mark its presence by setting the value at index `num - 1` in a new array `marked` to 1.

2. **Find the smallest missing positive integer:**
   - Iterate through the `marked` array.
   - Find the first index `i` where `marked[i]` is 0.
   - The smallest missing positive integer is `i + 1`.

Here is the Python code implementing this algorithm:
Response: python
def smallest_missing_positive_integer(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    marked = [0] * n
    
    for num in nums:
        if 1 <= num <= n:
            marked[num - 1] = 1
    
    for i in range(n):
        if marked[i] == 0:
            return i + 1

    return n + 1

Original Question: Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** height = \[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `n == height.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
*   `0 <= height[i] <= 105`
CoT: To solve the problem of computing how much water it can trap after raining on an elevation map, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. ** Initialize Pointers:**
   - Set two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the beginning and end of the array respectively.
   - Initialize two variables, `max_left` and `max_right`, to keep track of the maximum height to the left and right of the current position.

2. ** Iterate Between Pointers:**
   - While `left` is less than `right`, do the following:
     - Update `max_left` to be the maximum of `max_left` and `height[left]`.
     - Update `max_right` to be the maximum of `max_right` and `height[right]`.
     - If `height[left]` is less than `height[right]`, add the difference between `max_left` and `height[left]` to the total water trapped, and increment `left`.
     - Otherwise, add the difference between `max_right` and `height[right]` to the total water trapped, and decrement `right`.

3. ** Return Total Water Trapped:**
   - After the loop ends, return the total water trapped.

Here's the Python code implementing this algorithm:
Response: python
def trap_water(height):
    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    max_left, max_right = 0, 0
    total_water_trapped = 0

    while left < right:
        max_left = max(max_left, height[left])
        max_right = max(max_right, height[right])
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            total_water_trapped += max_left - height[left]
            left += 1
        else:
            total_water_trapped += max_right - height[right]
            right -= 1

    return total_water_trapped

# Example usage
height1 = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
print(trap_water(height1))  # Output: 6

Original Question: Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as strings, return the product of `num1` and `num2`, also represented as a string.

CoT: To solve the problem of multiplying two non-negative integers represented as strings without using any built-inBigInteger library or converting the inputs to integer directly, we can use a manual multiplication algorithm similar to how we do it by hand. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize the result**: Create a result string filled with zeros. The length of the result should be the sum of the lengths of `num1` and `num2`.

2. **Multiply each digit**: Starting from the least significant digit (rightmost) of `num2`, multiply each digit by each digit of `num1` and add the result to the appropriate position in the result string. This is done by shifting the intermediate result to the left (adding zeros at the end) for each digit in `num2`.

3. **Add the intermediate results**: After multiplying each digit of `num2` by `num1`, add all the intermediate results together to get the final product.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
def multiply(num1, num2):
    # Initialize the result with zeros
    result = ['0'] * (len(num1) + len(num2))
    
    # Reverse the strings to make the multiplication easier
    num1 = num1[::-1]
    num2 = num2[::-1]
    
    # Multiply each digit of num2 by each digit of num1
    for i in range(len(num2)):
        for j in range(len(num1)):
            # Multiply the digits
            product = int(num1[j]) * int(num2[i])
            # Add the product to the result
            result[i + j] += str(product)
    
    # Remove leading zeros
    result = ''.join(result).lstrip('0')
    
    return result

# Example usage
num1 = "123"
num2 = "456"

Original Question: Given an input string (`s`) and a pattern (`p`), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for `'?'` and `'*'` where:

*   `'?'` Matches any single character.
*   `'*'` Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
*   `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'?'` or `'*'`.
CoT: To solve the problem of wildcard pattern matching in Python, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will create a 2D boolean array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the first `i` characters of the string `s` match the first `j` characters of the pattern `p`.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize the 2D array `dp` with `dp[0][0] = True` because an empty pattern matches an empty string.
2. Fill in the first row of `dp` based on whether the pattern starts with `*`. If it does, then `dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1]` because `*` can match an empty string.
3. For each other cell `dp[i][j]`, check if the current characters of `s` and `p` match or if the pattern character is `*`. If they match or the pattern character is `*`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]` or `dp[i][j-1]` or `dp[i-1][j-1]` depending on the previous matches.
4. If the pattern character is `?`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]` because `?` matches any single character.
5. If the pattern character is not `*` or `?`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]` because the characters must exactly match.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:

def is_match(s, p):
    m, n = len(s), len(p)
    dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

Original Question: You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at `nums[0]`.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index `i`. In other words, if you are at `nums[i]`, you can jump to any `nums[i + j]` where:

*   `0 <= j <= nums[i]` and
*   `i + j < n`

Return _the minimum number of jumps to reach_ `nums[n - 1]`. The test cases are generated such that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will keep track of the farthest we can reach from the current position and update our position accordingly. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize the current position `i` to 0 and the farthest we can reach `max_reach` to 0.
2. Iterate through the array from `i` to `n-1`.
3. For each index `i`, update `max_reach` to the maximum of `max_reach` and `i + nums[i]`.
4. If `max_reach` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, return the number of jumps taken.
5. If `max_reach` is less than `n-1`, increment the number of jumps taken and update `i` to `max_reach`.

def min_jumps(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    i = 0

Original Question: Given an array of strings `strs`, group **the anagrams** together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strs = \["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"\]
**Output:** \[\["bat"\],\["nat","tan"\],\["ate","eat","tea"\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strs = \[""\]
**Output:** \[\[""\]\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** strs = \["a"\]
**Output:** \[\["a"\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= strs.length <= 104`
*   `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
*   `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
*   `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
CoT: To solve the problem of grouping anagrams together in Python, we can use a dictionary where the key is a sorted tuple of the characters in a word, and the value is a list of words that have the same sorted tuple. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Create an empty dictionary `anagrams` to store the groups of anagrams.
2. Iterate through each word `word` in the input list `strs`.
3. Sort the characters in `word` to form a key.
4. If the key is already in the dictionary, append `word` to the list of words already associated with that key.
5. If the key is not in the dictionary, create a new key with the sorted characters and assign it a new list containing `word`.
6. After iterating through all the words, return the values of the dictionary as a list of lists.

Here's the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
from collections import defaultdict

def group_anagrams(strs):
    anagrams = defaultdict(list)
    for word in strs:
        key = tuple(sorted(word))
        if key in anagrams:
            anagrams[key].append(word)
        else:
            anagrams[key] = [word]
    return list(anagrams.values())

# Example usage
strs = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
print(group_anagrams(strs))

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** \[\[ "Q "\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 9`
CoT: To solve the **n-queens** puzzle, we can use a backtracking algorithm. Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, incrementally building candidates to the solutions and **abstaining** a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be extended to a valid solution.

Here is the step-by-step Python code to solve the **n-queens** puzzle:

1. **Define the Problem:**
   - We need to place `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard.
   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

2. **Set Up the棋board:**
   - Use a 2D list to represent the chessboard, where each cell can either be empty (denoted by `'}`) or occupied by a queen (denoted by `Q`).

3. **Backtracking Function:**
   - Start from the first row and try to place a queen in each column of the current row.
   - If a queen can be placed in a column without attacking any other queens, move to the next row and repeat the process.
   - If all queens are placed successfully, we have found a solution.
   - If we cannot place a queen in any column of the current row, backtrack to the previous row and try to place the queen in a different column.

4. **Check Validity:**
   - Before placing a queen in a cell, check if it is safe to place the queen there. A queen is safe if it is not in the same row, column, or diagonal as any other queen.

5. **Implement the Algorithm:**
   - Use a recursive function to implement the backtracking algorithm.
   - Keep track of the current state of the chessboard and the solutions found.

Here is the Python code:
Response: python
def is_safe(board, row, col, n):
    # Check row
    for i in range(col):
        if board[row][i] == 'Q':

    # Check column

        if board[i][col] == 'Q':
            return False

    # Check diagonals
    for i in range(row - col, -1, -1):
        if board[i][col + i] == 'Q':
            return False
    for i in range(row + col, n):
        if board[i][col - (i - row)] == 'Q':
            return False

    return True

def solve_n_queens_util(board, col, n):
    # Base case: All queens are placed
    if col >= n:
        return [board[:]]

            solutions.extend(new_board)
            board[i][col] = '.'  # Backtrack

    return solutions

**Follow up:** If you have figured out the `O(n)` solution, try coding another solution using the **divide and conquer** approach, which is more subtle.
CoT: To find the subarray with the largest sum in an integer array `nums`, we can use the divide and conquer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Divide the array into two halves**: Recursively find the maximum subarray sum for the left half and the right half.
2. **Find the maximum subarray sum that crosses the midpoint**: This subarray will have its left end in the left half and its right end in the right half.
3. **Combine the results**: The maximum subarray sum will be the maximum of the three sums obtained from the left half, the right half, and the crossing subarray.

Let's implement this approach in Python:
Response: python
def maxSubarraySum(nums):
    def maxCrossingSum(numL, numR):
        leftSum = -float('inf')
        rightSum = -float('inf')

        for i in range(numL, numR + 1):
            sum += num[i]
            if sum > leftSum:
                leftSum = sum
        sum = 0
        for i in range(numR, numL - 1, -1):
            sum += num[i]
            if sum > rightSum:
                rightSum = sum
        return leftSum + rightSum

    if len(nums) == 1:
        return nums[0]

    mid = len(nums) // 2
    leftSum = maxSubarraySum(nums[:mid])
    rightSum = maxSubarraySum(nums[mid + 1:])
    crossSum = maxCrossingSum(mid, mid + 1)

    return max(leftSum, rightSum, crossSum)

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all elements of an `m x n` matrix in spiral order, we can use a systematic approach that iteratively solves the problem by reducing the size of the matrix in each iteration. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize the boundaries**: Define the top, bottom, left, and right boundaries of the current sub-matrix.
2. **Iterate over the elements**: While there are elements within the boundaries, do the following:
   - Iterate from left to right along the top row.
   - Iterate from top to bottom along the right column.
   - Iterate from bottom to top along the bottom row.
   - Iterate from right to left along the left column.
   - Update the boundaries after each iteration.
3. **Return the result**: Once all elements have been iterated, return the list of elements in spiral order.

CoT: To determine if it is possible to reach the last index of the array `nums`, we can use a greedy approach. We start at the first index and keep track of the farthest index we can reach from our current position. As we iterate through the array, we update this farthest index based on the maximum jump length at each position. If at any point the farthest index we can reach is less than the last index of the array, we conclude that it is impossible to reach the last index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = \[\[1,4\],\[4,5\]\]
**Output:** \[\[1,5\]\]
**Explanation:** Intervals \[1,4\] and \[4,5\] are considered overlapping.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= intervals.length <= 104`
*   `intervals[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= starti <= endi <= 104`
Attacked Question: Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return _an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = \[\[1,3\],\[2,6\],\[8,10\],\[15,18\]\]
**Output:** \[\[1,6\],\[8,10\],\[15,18\]\]
**Explanation:** Since intervals \[1,3\] and \[2,6\] overlap, merge them into \[1,6\].

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= intervals.length <= 104`
*   `intervals[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= starti <= endi <= 104`
CoT: To solve the problem of merging overlapping intervals, we can follow these steps:

1. **Sort the Intervals**: Sort the intervals based on their start times. This ensures that we always consider the next interval in the order of their start times.
2. **Initialize the Result**: Start with an empty list to store the result.
3. **Iterate Through the Intervals**: For each interval in the sorted list, check if it overlaps with the last interval in the result list.
   - If it does overlap, update the end time of the last interval in the result list to the maximum of the end times of the current interval and the last interval.
   - If it does not overlap, add the current interval to the result list.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    # Step 1: Sort the intervals based on their start times
    intervals.sort()

    # Step 2: Initialize the result list
    result = []

        if result and interval[0] <= result[-1][1]:
            # Update the end time of the last interval in the result list
            result[-1][1] = max(result[-1][1], interval[1])
        else:
            # Add the current interval to the result list
            result.append(interval)

Original Question: You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the `ith` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` _after the insertion_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = \[\[1,3\],\[6,9\]\], newInterval = \[2,5\]
**Output:** \[\[1,5\],\[6,9\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = \[\[1,2\],\[3,5\],\[6,7\],\[8,10\],\[12,16\]\], newInterval = \[4,8\]
**Output:** \[\[1,2\],\[3,10\],\[12,16\]\]
**Explanation:** Because the new interval \[4,8\] overlaps with \[3,5\],\[6,7\],\[8,10\].

CoT: To solve the problem of inserting a new interval into a sorted list of non-overlapping intervals, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the correct position for the new interval**: We need to find the position where the new interval should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the start times of the intervals.
2. **Check for overlaps**: We need to check if the new interval overlaps with any of the existing intervals. If it does, we need to merge the new interval with the overlapping intervals.
3. **Insert the new interval**: Once we have determined the correct position and have handled any overlaps, we can insert the new interval into the list.

Let's implement this step-by-step in Python.
Response: python
def insert_interval(intervals, new_interval):
    # Step 1: Find the correct position for the new interval
    left = 0
    right = len(intervals)
    while left < right:

        if intervals[mid][0] < new_interval[0]:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid

    # Step 2: Check for overlaps and merge if necessary

    else:
        intervals.insert(left, new_interval)

    # Step 3: Return the updated list of intervals

CoT: To find the \( k \)-th permutation of the set \([1, 2, 3, \ldots, n]\), we can use a factorial-based approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Calculate Factorials**: Compute the factorials of numbers from \(1\) to \(n\). These factorials will help us determine the position of each digit in the \( k \)-th permutation.

2. **Determine Permutation Digits**: Starting from the highest place value (the leftmost digit), we divide \( k \) by the factorial of the remaining digits to find the position of the next digit in the permutation. We then update \( k \) by taking the remainder of this division and move to the next lower place value.

3. **Construct the Permutation**: Once we have determined the position of each digit, we can construct the permutation by selecting the digits in the order we found them.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:

1. **Determine the effective rotation**: Since the list is circular, rotating by \( k \) places is equivalent to rotating by \( k \mod n \) places, where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the list. This ensures that \( k \) is within the range of the list's length.

2. **Find the new head and tail**: After determining the effective rotation, we need to find the new head and tail of the list. The new head will be the node that is \( n - (k \mod n) \) places from the original head. The new tail will be the node that is immediately before the new head.

CoT: To determine the number of unique paths a robot can take from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an `m x n` grid, we can use a combinatorial approach. The robot needs to make exactly `m-1` moves down and `n-1` moves right, regardless of the order. Therefore, the total number of unique paths is the number of ways to arrange these `m-1` down moves and `n-1` right moves in a sequence of length `m+n-2`.

This is a classic problem that can be solved using the binomial coefficient, which is given by:

\[
\binom{m+n-2}{m-1} = \frac{(m+n-2)!}{(m-1)!(n-1)!}
\]

We can use Python's `math.comb` function to compute this binomial coefficient. Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

1. Initialize `dp[0][0]` to 1 because there is exactly one way to be at the starting point.
2. For each cell `(i, j)`, if it is an obstacle (i.e., `obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1`), then `dp[i][j]` is 0 because the robot cannot pass through this cell.
3. If the cell is not an obstacle, then `dp[i][j]` is the sum of the number of ways to reach the cell above it (`dp[i-1][j]`) and the number of ways to reach the cell to the left of it (`dp[i][j-1]`).

Here is the Python code to implement this algorithm:

def count_paths(obstacleGrid):
    m = len(obstacleGrid)
    n = len(obstacleGrid[0])
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]

Original Question: Given a `m x n` `grid` filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,3,1\],\[1,5,1\],\[4,2,1\]\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** Because the path 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 minimizes the sum.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,2,3\],\[4,5,6\]\]
**Output:** 12

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`

*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a new grid `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum sum of the path from the top-left corner to the cell `(i, j)`. We can fill this grid iteratively by considering the minimum of the path from the cell above `(i-1, j)` and the cell to the left `(i, j-1)`.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize the first row and the first column of the `dp` grid.
2. For each cell `(i, j)` in the grid (starting from the second row and second column), calculate `dp[i][j]` as the minimum of `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i][j-1]` plus the value of `grid[i][j]`.
3. The answer will be in `dp[m-1][n-1]`.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def min_path_sum(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Initialize the first row and the first column
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
    for i in range(1, m):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0]
    for j in range(1, n):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j]
    
    # Fill the rest of the dp grid
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
    
    return dp[m-1][n-1]

# Example 1
grid1 = [[1,3,1], [1,5,1], [4,2,1]]
print(min_path_sum(grid1))  # Output: 7

# Example 2
grid2 = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]

Original Question: Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

*   A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
*   Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than `0` and not exceed `maxWidth`.
*   The input array `words` contains at least one word.

**Example 1:**

**Explanation:** Note that the last line is  "shall be     " instead of  "shall     be ", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.

CoT: To solve the problem of formatting the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified, we can follow these steps:

1. **Iterate through the words and pack them into lines:**
   - Start a new line when the current line's length (including spaces) reaches `maxWidth`.
   - Keep track of the current line's length and the number of words on it.

2. **Distribute extra spaces evenly between words:**
   - If a line has `wordsCount` words and ` spaces` extra spaces to be distributed, each word will get `extra spaces // wordsCount` spaces, and the remaining `extra spaces % wordsCount` spaces will be distributed to the leftmost words.

3. **Left-justify the last line:**
   - For the last line, do not distribute extra spaces. Instead, left-justify all the words by adding extra spaces to the right.

CoT: To find the square root of a non-negative integer `x` and round it down to the nearest integer without using any built-in exponent function or operator, we can use a binary search approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize two pointers **: `left` and `right`. Set `left` to 0 and `right` to `x`.
2. ** Perform binary search **: While `left` is less than or equal to `right`, do the following:
   - Calculate the middle point `mid` as `(left + right) // 2`.
   - If `mid * mid` is equal to `x`, return `mid`.
   - If `mid * mid` is less than `x`, set `left` to `mid + 1`.
   - If `mid * mid` is greater than `x`, set `right` to `mid - 1`.
3. ** Return the result **: After the loop ends, `left` will be the smallest integer such that `left * left` is greater than `x`. Therefore, `left - 1` will be the largest integer such that `(left - 1) * (left - 1)` is less than or equal to `x`. Since we are asked to round down to the nearest integer, we return `left - 1`.

Here is the Python code implementing this approach:
Response: python
def sqrt(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 0

    left, right = 1, x
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if mid * mid == x:
            return mid
        elif mid * mid < x:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return right

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1:**

1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 45`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of distinct ways to climb a staircase with `n` steps, where you can either climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, we can use a dynamic programming approach. This approach involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using the solutions to these subproblems to solve the original problem.

Let's define `dp[i]` as the number of distinct ways to climb to the `i`-th step. The base cases are:
- `dp[1] = 1` (There is only one way to climb to the 1st step: take 1 step.)
- `dp[2] = 2` (There are two ways to climb to the 2nd step: take 1 step + 1 step, or take 2 steps.)

For `i > 2`, the number of ways to climb to the `i`-th step is the sum of the number of ways to climb to the `(i-1)`-th step (and then take 1 more step) and the number of ways to climb to the `(i-2)`-th step (and then take 2 more steps). Therefore, we have the recurrence relation:
\[ dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] \]

We can implement this dynamic programming solution in Python as follows:
Response: python
def climb_stairs(n):
    # Base cases
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    if n == 2:
        return 2
    
    # Initialize the dp array with the base cases
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 2
    
    # Fill in the dp array using the recurrence relation
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    
    # The answer is the number of ways to climb to the n-th step
    return dp[n]

# Example usage
print(climb_stairs(2))  # Output: 2

Original Question: Given a string `path`, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.

In a Unix-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory, a double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `'//'`) are treated as a single slash `'/'`. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

The **canonical path** should have the following format:

*   The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.
*   Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.
*   The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.
*   The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

Return _the simplified **canonical path**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** path =  "/home/ "
**Output:**  "/home "
**Explanation:** Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** path =  "/../ "
**Output:**  "/ "
**Explanation:** Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** path =  "/home//foo/ "
**Output:**  "/home/foo "
**Explanation:** In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= path.length <= 3000`
*   `path` consists of English letters, digits, period `'.'`, slash `'/'` or `'_'`.
*   `path` is a valid absolute Unix path.

CoT: To convert an absolute path to its simplified canonical path, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Remove trailing斜** from the path.
2. ** handling period `'.'` and double period `'..`**:
   - When we encounter a period `'.'`, we do nothing.
   - When we encounter a double period `'..'`, we remove the current directory and go up a level.

CoT: To solve the problem of setting the entire row and column to 0's if an element is 0 in an `m x n` integer matrix in place, we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify the rows and columns that need to be set to 0:**
   - We need to keep track of the rows and columns that contain at least one 0.
   - We can use two sets: one for rows and one for columns.

2. **Iterate through the matrix to identify the rows and columns:**
   -遍历每个 element in the matrix.
   - If an element is 0, add its row index to the set of rows and its column index to the set of columns.

3. **Set the rows and columns to 0:**
   - Iterate through the matrix again.
   - For each element, if its row index is in the set of rows or its column index is in the set of columns, set the element to 0.

CoT: To solve this problem in Python with a time complexity of \(O(\log(m \cdot n))\), we can use a binary search approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We have an \(m \times n\) matrix where each row is sorted in non-decreasing order, and the first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row. We need to find if a given target integer is in the matrix.

2. **Binary Search Approach**: We can treat the matrix as a single sorted list of length \(m \cdot n\). This is because the rows are sorted, and the first element of each row is greater than the last element of the previous row, which ensures that the entire matrix is sorted when read row by row.

3. ** Implement Binary Search**: We can use Python's built-in `binary_search` function from the ` bisect` module to find the position of the target in the matrix. The `binary_search` function returns the index of the target if it is found, or the index where it would be inserted if it is not found.

4. **Convert Index to Matrix Position**: After finding the index in the single sorted list, we can convert this index back to the row and column position in the matrix. If the target is found at this position, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
import bisect

def find_target(matrix, target):
    # Calculate the total number of elements in the matrix
    total_elements = len(matrix) * len(matrix[0])

    index = bisect.bisect(matrix, target)
    
    # Convert the index back to row and column position
    row = index // len(matrix[0])
    col = index % len(matrix[0])
    
    # Check if the target is found at the calculated position
    if matrix[row][col] == target:
        return True

CoT: To solve the problem of sorting an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue in place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue, we can use a three-pointer approach. This approach will allow us to sort the array in a single pass using only constant extra space.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning and implementation:

1. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - Initialize three pointers: `red` at the beginning of the array (index 0), `white` at the current position (index 0), and `blue` at the end of the array (index `n-1`).

2. **Iterate Through the Array:**
   - Iterate through the array from the beginning to the end.
   - For each element at index `i`:
     - If the element is 0 (red), swap it with the element at the `red` pointer and increment both `red` and `white`.
     - If the element is 1 (white), do nothing and increment `white`.
     - If the element is 2 (blue), swap it with the element at the `blue` pointer and decrement `blue`.

3. **Stop When Pointers Meet:**
   - The iteration stops when `white` and `blue` meet or cross each other.

4. **Final Array:**
   - After the iteration, the array will be sorted with all 0's (red) at the beginning, followed by all 1's (white), and then all 2's (blue).

Here is the Python code implementing the above algorithm:
Response: python
def sort_colors(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    red = 0
    white = 0
    blue = n - 1

Original Question: Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return _the **minimum window**_ **_substring_** _of_ `s` _such that every character in_ `t` _(**including duplicates**) is included in the window_. If there is no such substring, return _the empty string_ `" "`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "ADOBECODEBANC ", t =  "ABC "
**Output:**  "BANC "
**Explanation:** The minimum window substring  "BANC " includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "a ", t =  "a "
**Output:**  "a "
**Explanation:** The entire string s is the minimum window.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "a ", t =  "aa "
**Output:**  " "
**Explanation:** Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.

**Constraints:**

*   `m == s.length`
*   `n == t.length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 105`
*   `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

**Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`, we can use a two-pointer approach along with a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of characters in `t` and the current window in `s`.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the dictionary for `t`**:
   - Create a dictionary `t_dict` to store the frequency of each character in `t`.

2. **Initialize the two pointers**:
   - Set `left` and `right` to 0. These will be the left and right boundaries of the current window in `s`.

3. **Initialize variables for the minimum window**:
   - Set `min_length` to a large number (e.g., `m + 1`).
   - Set `min_window` to an empty string.

4. **Iterate over the characters in `s`**:
   - Use a while loop to move the `right` pointer from 0 to `m`.
   - For each character `s[right]` in `s`, update its frequency in a dictionary `s_dict`.
   - Check if the current window contains all characters of `t`:
     - Create a new dictionary `current_dict` by copying `s_dict`.
     - Remove characters from `current_dict` that are not in `t_dict` or have a frequency less than their frequency in `t_dict`.
     - If `current_dict` is empty, it means the current window contains all characters of `t`.
     - Update `min_length` and `min_window` if the current window is smaller than the current `min_length`.

5. **Move the `left` pointer**:
   - If the current window contains all characters of `t`, move the `left` pointer to the right until the window no longer contains all characters of `t` or `left` reaches `right`.

6. **Return the minimum window**:
   - After the loop, if `min_length` is still a large number, return an empty string. Otherwise, return `min_window`.

Here is the Python code implementing the above steps:
Response: python
def min window_substring(s, t):
    t_dict = {}
    for char in t:
        t_dict[char] = t_dict.get(char, 0) + 1

    left, right = 0, 0
    min_length = len(s) + 1
    min_window = ""

    s_dict = {}
    while right < len(s):
        s_dict[s[right]] = s_dict.get(s[right], 0) + 1

        while all(s_dict[char] >= t_dict[char] for char in t_dict):
            if right - left + 1 < min_length:
                min_length = right - left + 1
                min_window = s[left(right]

            s_dict[s[left]] -= 1
            left += 1

        right += 1

    return min_window if min_length!= len(s) + 1 else ""

CoT: To generate all possible subsets of a given set of unique integers, we can use a recursive approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Base Case**: If the input list `nums` is empty, return a list containing an empty list. This is because the power set of an empty set is a set containing only the empty set.

2. **Recursive Step**:
   - Take the first element of the list, `nums[0]`.
   - Recursively generate the power set of the rest of the list, `nums[1:]`.
   - For each subset in the power set of `nums[1:]`, create a new subset by adding `nums[0]` to it.
   - Combine the original power set of `nums[1:]` with the new subsets created.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
def power_set(nums):
    if not nums:
        return [[]]
    
    first = nums[0]
    rest = nums[1:]

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove some duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears **at most twice**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` _after placing the final result in the first_ `k` _slots of_ `nums`.

Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array

CoT: To solve the problem of removing duplicates from the array `nums` such that each unique element appears at most twice and the relative order of the elements is preserved, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: We start with two pointers, `i` and `j`, where `i` is the slow pointer and `j` is the fast pointer. Initially, both pointers are at the beginning of the array.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**: We iterate through the array using the fast pointer `j`. For each element at position `j`, we check if it is the same as the element at position `i` or `i-1` (if `i` is greater than 0).

3. **  rite Elements**: If the element at position `j` is different from the element at position `i` or `i-1`, it means it is a new unique element or a second occurrence of an existing unique element. In this case, we move the slow pointer `i` to the next position and set the element at position `i` to the element at position `j`.

4. **Continue Iterating**: We continue this process until the fast pointer `j` reaches the end of the array.

5. **Return the Result**: After the loop, the slow pointer `i` will be at the position where the last valid element is located. The value of `i` is the number of elements in the array after removing the duplicates.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
def remove duplicates(nums):
    i = 0
    for j in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[j]!= nums[i] or (i > 0 and nums[j] == nums[i-1]):

CoT: To solve the problem of finding a target value in a rotated sorted array that may contain duplicates, we can use a modified binary search approach. The key is to handle the rotation and duplicates in a way that allows us to efficiently determine if the target is in the array.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the rotation point:**
   - The rotation point is the index where the array is divided into two parts. The left part is greater than or equal to the right part.
   - We can use binary search to find the rotation point. The rotation point `k` is the index where `nums[k] >= nums[k+1]`.

2. **Perform binary search:**
   - Once we have the rotation point, we can perform a binary search in the appropriate part of the array.
   - If the target is in the range of the left part (from `0` to `k`), we search in the left part.
   - If the target is in the range of the right part (from `k+1` to `n-1`), we search in the right part.
   - If the target is equal to the rotation point, we return `true`.

3. **Handle duplicates:**
   - When handling duplicates, we need to ensure that we do not fall into an infinite loop. We can do this by checking if the current element is equal to the target before returning `true` or `false`.
   - If the current element is equal to the target, we return `true`.
   - If the current element is equal to the next element, we move to the next element without incrementing the search range.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def search_in_rotated_array(nums, target):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Find the rotation point
    left, right = 0, n-1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] >= nums[mid+1]:
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    # Perform binary search in the appropriate part
    if target == nums[left]:
        return True
    if target < nums[left]:
        return False
    left, right = left, n-1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return True
        if nums[mid] > target:
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    return False

# Example usage
nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2]
target = 0
print(search_in_rotated_array(nums, target))  # Output: True

nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2]
target = 3

CoT: To solve the problem of deleting all nodes that have duplicate numbers from a sorted linked list and returning the list sorted as well, we can use a simple approach with a double-pointer. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Create two pointers, `current` and `next`, where `current` starts at the head of the list and `next` starts at the second node of the list.
2. **Iterate Through the List**: Iterate through the list with the `current` pointer. For each node that `current` points to, compare its value with the value of the next node ( pointed by `next`).
3. **Remove Duplicates**: If the values of the current and next nodes are the same, remove the next node by updating the `next` pointer to point to the next node after the current node. This effectively removes the duplicate.
4. **Move To Next Sarah**: If the values are different, move both the `current` and `next` pointers to the next node.
5. **Return the heads**: After the iteration, return the head of the list.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def delete duplicates_in_sorted_list(head):
    # If the head is None or the head's next is None, there are no duplicates to remove.
    if head is None or head.next is None:
        return head
    
    # Initialize two pointers.
    current = head
    next = head.next
    
    # Iterate through the list.
    while next is not None:
        # If the current and next nodes have the same value, remove the next node.
        if current_val == next_val:
            current.next = next next
        # Move both pointers to the next node.
        current = current next
        next = next next
    
    # Return the head of the list.

CoT: To solve the problem of deleting duplicates from a sorted linked list such that each element appears only once and the list remains sorted, we can use a simple iteration through the list. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize a variable `previous` to `None`**. This variable will keep track of the previous node in the list.
2. **Iterate through the list using a variable `current`**. For each node, compare its value with the value of the previous node.
3. **If the value of the current node is different from the value of the previous node**, it means the current node is not a duplicate. In this case, update the `previous` node to the current node.
4. **If the value of the current node is the same as the value of the previous node**, it means the current node is a duplicate. In this case, set the `current` node's next pointer to the next node in the list.
5. **After iterating through the entire list**, the `previous` node will point to the last unique node in the list. Therefore, the head of the new list will be the head of the original list, and the tail will be the last unique node.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= heights.length <= 105`
*   `0 <= heights[i] <= 104`
CoT: To find the area of the largest rectangle in a histogram, we can use a stack to keep track of the bars that we have seen so far. The idea is to iterate through the bars from left to right and use the stack to find the bar that will give us the maximum area when combined with the bars on either side.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Initialize an empty stack and a variable `max_area` to keep track of the maximum area found so far.
2. Iterate through the bars in the histogram.
3. While the stack is not empty and the current bar is less than the top bar on the stack, pop the top bar from the stack and calculate the area of the rectangle that can be formed with the popped bar as the height and the width as the distance from the current bar to the next bar on the stack (or the start of the histogram if the stack is empty).
4. Push the current bar onto the stack.
5. After iterating through all the bars, pop the remaining bars from the stack and calculate the area of the rectangle that can be formed with the popped bar as the height and the width as the distance from the popped bar to the end of the histogram.
6. Return the maximum area found.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:

CoT: To find the largest rectangle containing only `1`'s in a binary matrix, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will calculate the height of consecutive `1`'s in each column and then find the maximum area of a rectangle that can be formed with these heights.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the matrix**: Create a new matrix `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the height of consecutive `1`'s ending at position `(i, j)`. If `matrix[i][j]` is `0`, then `dp[i][j]` is `0`. If `matrix[i][j]` is `1`, then `dp[i][j]` is `dp[i-1][j] + 1`.

2. **Calculate the maximum area**: For each row `i` in the matrix, we will find the maximum area of a rectangle that can be formed using the heights in the current row. We can do this by iterating through each column `j` and calculating the area of a rectangle with height `dp[i][j]` and width `j - left + 1`, where `left` is the leftmost position of the rectangle.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: Create two pointers, `left` and `right`. The `left` pointer will point to the head of the list, and the `right` pointer will point to the next node after the head.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Iterate through the list using the `right` pointer. For each node:
   - If the value of the node is less than `x`, move the `left` pointer to the right and swap the values of the nodes at the `left` and `right` pointers.
   - If the value of the node is greater than or equal to `x`, move the `right` pointer to the right.

3. **Stop When `right` reach the End**: Once the `right` pointer reaches the end of the list, stop the iteration.

4. **Set the Partition**: After the iteration, all nodes to the left of the `left` pointer will be less than `x`, and all nodes to the right of the `left` pointer will be greater than or equal to `x`. Set the next node after the `left` pointer as the new head of the list.

2.  If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
    *   Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is `s`, divide it to `x` and `y` where `s = x + y`.
    *   **Randomly** decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, `s` may become `s = x + y` or `s = y + x`.

CoT: To determine if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, we need to check if `s2` can be obtained by applying the given algorithm to `s1`. The algorithm involves recursively dividing the string into two non-empty substrings and randomly either swapping or keeping them in order.

We can use a recursive approach to check all possible ways to divide and rearrange the substrings of `s1` to see if they can form `s2`. However, since the algorithm involves random choices, we need to consider all possible permutations of the substrings.

A more efficient approach is to use a set to keep track of all possible permutations of the substrings of `s1` and check if `s2` is in this set. This approach works because the algorithm only involves dividing the string into two parts and recursively applying the same algorithm to each part, which means that all possible permutations of the substrings of `s1` can be generated.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

Original Question: You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array_ `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,2,3,0,0,0\], m = 3, nums2 = \[2,5,6\], n = 3
**Output:** \[1,2,2,3,5,6\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[1,2,3\] and \[2,5,6\].
The result of the merge is \[1,2,2,3,5,6\] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1\], m = 1, nums2 = \[\], n = 0
**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[1\] and \[\].
The result of the merge is \[1\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[0\], m = 0, nums2 = \[1\], n = 1
**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[\] and \[1\].
The result of the merge is \[1\].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

**Constraints:**

*   `nums1.length == m + n`
*   `nums2.length == n`
*   `0 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `1 <= m + n <= 200`
*   `-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109`

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?
CoT: To merge two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` into a single sorted array within `nums1`, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers, one at the end of `nums1` (which is at index `m-1` since `nums1` has `m` elements) and one at the end of `nums2` (which is at index `n-1` since `nums2` has `n` elements).

2. **Compare Elements**: Compare the elements at the current positions of the two pointers. If the element in `nums1` is greater than the element in `nums2`, place the element from `nums2` at the current position in `nums1` and move the pointer in `nums2` to the left. If the element in `nums1` is less than or equal to the element in `nums2`, place the element from `nums1` at the current position in `nums1` and move the pointer in `nums1` to the left.

3. **Continue until One Pointers reach the Start**: Continue this process until one of the pointers reaches the start of its respective array. At this point, all elements from the other array will have been placed in `nums1`.

4. **Set Remaining Elements**: If there are any remaining elements in `nums2` (which means `n > 0`), set them to the end of `nums1`.

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def merge arrays(nums1, m, nums2, n):
    # Initialize pointers
    i = m - 1
    j = n - 1
    # Start from the end of nums1
    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
        if nums1[i] > nums2[j]:
            nums1[i + j + 1] = nums2[j]
            j -= 1
        else:
            nums1[i + j + 1] = nums1[i]
            i -= 1
    
    # Set remaining elements from nums2
    if j >= 0:
        nums1[i + j + 1: i + j + 1 + n - j] = nums2[j: n]

*   `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding all possible subsets of an integer array `nums` that may contain duplicates, we can use a recursive approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Define the recursive function**: We'll define a function `find_subsets` that takes the current index in the array, the current subset, and the list of subsets found so far.
2. **Base case**: If the current index is equal to the length of the array, we add the current subset to the list of subsets and return.
3. **Recursive case**: For each element at the current index, we have two choices:
   - Include the element in the current subset and move to the next index.
   - Exclude the element from the current subset and move to the next index.
4. **Avoid duplicates**: To avoid duplicate subsets, we can sort the array first and then use a set to keep track of the subsets we have already found. However, a simpler approach is to use a set to check if a subset is already in the list of subsets before adding it.

Here's the Python code for the solution:

def find_subsets(nums):
    subsets = []
    current_subset = []

Original Question: A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be **encoded** into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' ->  "1 "
'B' ->  "2 "
...
'Z' ->  "26 "

To **decode** an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `"11106 "` can be mapped into:

*   `"AAJF "` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`
*   `"KJF "` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`

Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `"06 "` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `"6 "` is different from `"06 "`.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return _the **number** of ways to **decode** it_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "12 "
**Output:** 2

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "06 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:**  "06 " cannot be mapped to  "F " because of the leading zero ( "6 " is different from  "06 ").

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
*   `s` contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
*   `s` contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).
CoT: To solve the problem of decoding an encoded message, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Let's define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to decode the first `i` characters of the string `s`.

The base cases are:
- `dp[0] = 1` because there is exactly one way to decode an empty string (do nothing).
- `dp[1] = 1` if `s[0]` is not '0', because there is exactly one way to decode a single character (itself).

For `i` from 2 to `n` (where `n` is the length of the string), we can decode the string in two ways:
1. By taking the first character of the string and decode it alone. This is possible if `s[0]` is not '0'. The number of ways to do this is `dp[i-1]`.
2. By taking the first two characters of the string and decode them together. This is possible if the two-digit number formed by `s[0]` and `s[1]` is between 10 and 26. The number of ways to do this is `dp[i-2]`.

Therefore, the recurrence relation is:
\[ dp[i] = dp[i-1] \text{ if } s[0] \neq '0' \text{ and } \text{the two-digit number formed by } s[0] \text{ and } s[1] \text{ is not between 10 and 26} \]
\[ dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] \text{ if } s[0] \neq '0' \text{ and } \text{the two-digit number formed by } s[0] \text{ and } s[1] \text{ is between 10 and 26} \]
\[ dp[i] = dp[i-1] \text{ if } s[0] = '0' \]

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def num解 coding(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    dp[1] = 1 if s[0]!= '0' else 0

    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if s[i-1]!= '0':
            dp[i] += dp[i-1]
        if 10 <= int(s[i-2:i]) <= 26:
            dp[i] += dp[i-2]

    return dp[n]

CoT: To solve the problem of reversing a portion of a singly linked list from position `left` to position `right`, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Create four pointers: `start`, `end`, `startNext`, and `endNext`. `start` will point to the node at position `left-1`, `end` will point to the node at position `right`, `startNext` will point to the next node after `start`, and `endNext` will point to the next node after `end`.

2. **Set Up the Reversal**: Iterate from `start` to `end` and reverse the links between the nodes. This can be done by updating the `next` pointers of the nodes in the range from `left` to `right`.

3. **Connect the Pointers**: After reversing the links, connect the `startNext` to the `endNext` to complete the list.

4. **Return the Reversed List**: Return the head of the reversed list, which is the `startNext` node.

*   `s` consists of digits only.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into a given string `s`, we can use a recursive approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Define the recursive function**: We'll create a function `find_ip_addresses` that takes the current string `s`, the current index `i`, and the current list of dots `dots` as parameters. The function will return a list of all valid IP addresses that can be formed from the current state.

2. **Base case**: If the current index `i` is equal to the length of the string `s`, we have reached the end of the string. At this point, we check if the current list of dots forms a valid IP address. If it does, we add it to the result list. If it doesn't, we do nothing.

3. **Recursive case**: If the current index `i` is not equal to the length of the string `s`, we have two options:
   - Insert a dot at the current index.
   - Do not insert a dot at the current index.

   For each option, we update the current list of dots and make a recursive call to `find_ip_addresses` with the updated parameters. After the recursive call, we remove the last dot from the list to backtrack.

   - There are exactly three dots.
   - Each segment between the dots is a valid integer between 0 and 255.
   - Each segment does not have leading zeros.

            segment4 = s[dots[2]:]
            if segment1 and segment1[0]!= '0' and int(segment1) <= 255 and \
               segment2 and segment2[0]!= '0' and int(segment2) <= 255 and \

               segment4 and segment4[0]!= '0' and int(segment4) <= 255:
                return [segment1 + '.' + segment2 + '.' + segment3 + '.' + segment4]
        return []
    
    result = []
    if i < len(s) - 2:
        # Insert a dot at the current index
        dots.append(i + 1)
        result += find_ip_addresses(s, i + 1, dots)
        dots.pop()
    
    # Do not insert a dot at the current index
    result += find_ip_addresses(s, i + 1, dots)
    
    return result

CoT: To solve the problem of generating all structurally unique binary search trees (BSTs) with exactly `n` nodes of unique values from `1` to `n`, we can use a recursive approach. The key idea is to consider each possible root value and recursively generate all possible left and right subtrees.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Base Case**: If `n` is 0, there are no trees to generate, so we return an empty list.
2. **Recursive Case**: For each possible root value `i` (where `1 <= i <= n`), we generate all possible left subtrees using the values from `1` to `i-1` and all possible right subtrees using the values from `i+1` to `n`. We then combine each left tree with each right tree to form a new binary search tree with root `i`.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
from typing import List

def generate_bst(n: int) -> List[ binary_tree]:
    if n == 0:
        return []

CoT: To determine the number of structurally unique binary search trees (BSTs) with exactly \( n \) nodes of unique values from 1 to \( n \), we can use a recursive approach. The key insight is that for any given root value \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq n \)), the left子 tree will contain the values from 1 to \( k-1 \), and the right子 tree will contain the values from \( k+1 \) to \( n \). The number of unique BSTs for each of these subtrees can be calculated recursively.

Let's define \( f(n) \) as the number of unique BSTs with \( n \) nodes. The recurrence relation for \( f(n) \) is:
\[ f(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} f(k-1) \cdot f(n-k) \]
where \( f(0) = 1 \) (the base case, representing an empty tree).

We can implement this recurrence relation using a Python function. Here's the step-by-step code:

1. Define a function `num_unique_bst(n)` that returns the number of unique BSTs with \( n \) nodes.
2. Use a list `dp` to store the number of unique BSTs for each number of nodes from 0 to \( n \).
3. Initialize `dp[0]` to 1.
4. For each \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), calculate \( dp[i] \) using the recurrence relation.
5. Return `dp[n]`.

Here's the Python code:
Response: python
def num_unique_bst(n):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            dp[i] += dp[j-1] * dp[i-j]
    return dp[n]

Original Question: Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an **interleaving** of `s1` and `s2`.

An **interleaving** of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where `s` and `t` are divided into `n` and `m` substrings respectively, such that:

*   `s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
*   `t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
*   `|n - m| <= 1`
*   The **interleaving** is `s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ...` or `t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...`

**Note:** `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  "aabcc ", s2 =  "dbbca ", s3 =  "aadbbcbcac "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 =  "aa " +  "bc " +  "c ", and s2 into s2 =  "dbbc " +  "a ".
Interleaving the two splits, we get  "aa " +  "dbbc " +  "bc " +  "a " +  "c " =  "aadbbcbcac ".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  "aabcc ", s2 =  "dbbca ", s3 =  "aadbbbaccc "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  " ", s2 =  " ", s3 =  " "
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= s3.length <= 200`
*   `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` consist of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it using only `O(s2.length)` additional memory space?

**Follow up:** Could you solve it using only `O(s2.length)` additional memory space?
CoT: To determine if `s3` is an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will create a 2D boolean array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is true if the first `i` characters of `s1` and the first `j` characters of `s2` can form the first `i+j` characters of `s3`.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize the dimensions of the `dp` array based on the lengths of `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`.
2. Set `dp[0][0]` to true since an empty string is an empty interleaving.
3. Fill in the first row and first column of the `dp` array. If the first character of `s1` matches the first character of `s3`, then `dp[1][j]` is true for all `j` up to the length of `s2`. Similarly, if the first character of `s2` matches the first character of `s3`, then `dp[i][1]` is true for all `i` up to the length of `s1`.
4. For the rest of the `dp` array, fill in each cell `dp[i][j]` based on the following conditions:
   - If the `i`-th character of `s1` matches the `i+j`-th character of `s3`, then `dp[i][j]` is true if `dp[i-1][j]` is true.
   - If the `j`-th character of `s2` matches the `i+j`-th character of `s3`, then `dp[i][j]` is true if `dp[i][j-1]` is true.
   - If both conditions are false, then `dp[i][j]` is false.
5. The final answer is `dp[s1.length][s2.length]`.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def is_interleaving(s1, s2, s3):
    m, n, p = len(s1), len(s2), len(s3)
    
    # Initialize the dp array

*   The number of nodes in both trees is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`
Attacked Question: Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** p = \[1,2,3\], q = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** p = \[1,2\], q = \[1,null,2\]
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** p = \[1,2,1\], q = \[1,1,2\]
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in both trees is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`
CoT: To determine if two binary trees are the same, we need to check if they have the same structure and the same values at each corresponding node. We can achieve this by performing a depth-first search (DFS) on both trees simultaneously and comparing the values at each node.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:
Response: python
def is_same_tree(p, q):
    # If both trees are empty, they are the same
    if p is None and q is None:
        return True
    
    # If one tree is empty and the other is not, they are different
    if p is None or q is None:
        return False
    
    # If the values at the current nodes are different, the trees are different
    if p_val!= q_val:
        return False
    
    # Recursively check the left and right subtrees
    return is_same_tree(p_left, q_left) and is_same_tree(p_right, q_right)

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the zigzag level order traversal of a binary tree, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach with a queue to keep track of the nodes at each level. We will also use a flag to determine the direction of the traversal (left to right or right to left) for each level.

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. **Initialize the queue and the result list:**
   - Start with the root node in the queue.
   - Create an empty result list to store the values of the nodes at each level.

2. **Set the direction flag:**
   - Start with the direction flag set to `True` (left to right).

3. **Perform BFS:**
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Initialize an empty list to store the values of the nodes at the current level.
     - For each node in the queue, do the following:
       - If the direction flag is `True`, add the value of the node to the left end of the current level list.
       - If the direction flag is `False`, add the value of the node to the right end of the current level list.
     - Set the direction flag to the opposite value.
     - Add the children of the current node to the queue.

**Input:** nums = \[-10,-3,0,5,9\]
**Output:** \[0,-3,9,-10,null,5\]
**Explanation:** \[0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9\] is also accepted:
 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,3\]
**Output:** \[3,1\]
**Explanation:** \[1,null,3\] and \[3,1\] are both height-balanced BSTs.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
*   `nums` is sorted in a **strictly increasing** order.
CoT: To convert a sorted integer array `nums` into a height-balanced binary search tree (BST), we can use a recursive approach. The key idea is to choose the middle element of the array as the root of the current sub tree. This ensures that the tree is height-balanced because the left and right subtrees will each have approximately half the number of elements of the current tree.

Here is the step-by-step Python code to achieve this:
Response: python
def sorted array to height-balanced binary search tree(nums):
    if not nums:
        return None
    
    # Choose the middle element as the root
    mid = len(nums) // 2
    root = TreeNode(nums[mid])
    
    # Recursively construct the left and right subtrees
    root-left = sorted array to height-balanced binary search tree(nums[:mid])
    root-right = sorted array to height-balanced binary search tree(nums[mid+1:])
    
    return root

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self val = val
        self-left = None

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return `true` if the tree has a **root-to-leaf** path such that adding up all the values along the path equals `targetSum`.

A **leaf** is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1\], targetSum = 22
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3\], targetSum = 5
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
(1 --> 2): The sum is 3.

There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.

**Example 3:**

CoT: To solve the problem of finding a root-to-leaf path in a binary tree that sums up to a given target sum, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will recursively explore each path from the root to the leaves, keeping track of the current sum of the values along the path.

A **root-to-leaf** path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A **leaf** is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1\], targetSum = 22
**Output:** \[\[5,4,11,2\],\[5,8,4,5\]\]
**Explanation:** There are two paths whose sum equals targetSum:

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree where the sum of the node values equals a given target sum, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Define the Problem**: We need to find all paths from the root to the leaves where the sum of the node values equals the target sum. Each path should be returned as a list of node values.

2. **Recursive Function**: We will use a recursive function to perform the DFS. The function will take the current node, the current path, and the current sum as parameters. It will explore all paths from the current node to its children.

3. **Base Case**: If the current node is a leaf (i.e., it has no children), we check if the current sum equals the target sum. If it does, we add the current path to the result list.

4. **Recursive Case**: If the current node is not a leaf, we recursively call the function for each child of the current node, updating the current path and the current sum.

5. **Initialize the Result**: Before starting the DFS, we initialize an empty list to store the result paths.

6. **Perform the DFS**: We call the recursive function with the root node, an empty path, and a current sum of 0.

7. **Return the Result**: After the DFS is complete, we return the result list.

Here's the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
def find_paths(root, targetSum):
    result = []
    def dfs(node, path, currentSum):
        if not node:

CoT: To flat a binary tree into a "linked list" in the order of a pre-order traversal, we can use a recursive approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Base Case**: If the root is `None`, return `None` because there is no tree to flat.
2. **Recursive Step**:
   - Set the `left` child of the root to `None` because we want to convert the tree into a linked list.
   - Recursively flat the right child of the root.
   - Recursively flat the left child of the root.
   - After the recursive calls, the right child of the root will be the head of the linked list. Set the `right` child of the root to the result of the recursive call on the left child of the root.
   - Set the `left` child of the root to the result of the recursive call on the right child of the root.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of distinct subsequences of string `s` that equal string `t`, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of distinct subsequences of the first `i` characters of `s` that equal the first `j` characters of `t`.

The base cases are:
- `dp[0][0] = 1` because an empty string is a subsequence of an empty string.
- `dp[i][0] = 1` for all `i` because an empty string is a subsequence of any string.
- `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `j > 0` because a non-empty string cannot be a subsequence of an empty string.

For `i > 0` and `j > 0`, the recurrence relation is:
- If `s[i-1] == t[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]`. This is because we can either include `s[i-1]` in the subsequence (in which case we need to find the number of subsequences of the first `i-1` characters of `s` that equal the first `j-1` characters of `t`) or exclude `s[i-1]` (in which case we need to find the number of subsequences of the first `i-1` characters of `s` that equal the first `j` characters of `t`).
- If `s[i-1]!= t[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`. This is because we cannot include `s[i-1]` in the subsequence.

Here is the Python code to implement this dynamic programming solution:
Response: python
def count_subsequences(s, t):
    m = len(s)
    n = len(t)

Original Question: You are given a **perfect binary tree** where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node \*left;
  Node \*right;
  Node \*next;
}

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3,4,5,6,7\]
**Output:** \[1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#\]
**Explanation:** Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 212 - 1]`.
*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

**Follow-up:**

*   You may only use constant extra space.
*   The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

CoT: To solve the problem of populated next right pointers in a perfect binary tree, we can use a recursive approach. The key idea is to use the next right pointers of the children to connect them to their siblings in the same level.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Base Case**: If the root is `NULL`, there is no tree to population, so we return `NULL`.
2. **Recursive Step**: For a non-empty tree, we recursively population the left and right subtrees.
3. **Connect Siblings**: After population the subtrees, we connect the right child of the leftmost node in the left subtree to the leftmost node in the right subtree. This ensures that all nodes in the same level are connected in a circular manner.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def populationNext Pointers(root):
    if root is None:
        return root
    
    # Recursively population the left and right subtrees
    root left = populationNext Pointers(root left)
    root right = populationNext Pointers(root right)
    
    # Connect the right child of the leftmost node in the left subtree to the leftmost node in the right subtree
    if root left is not None:
        root left next = root right
    
    return root

CoT: To solve the problem of populated next right pointers in a binary tree, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. This approach allows us to visit each level of the tree from left to right and set the next pointers accordingly.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize a queue**: Start by adding the root node to a queue. This will allow us to process the tree level by level.

2. ** Process each level**: While the queue is not empty, perform the following steps:
   - Get the number of nodes at the current level by getting the size of the queue.
   - For each node at the current level, do the following:
     - Set the next pointer of the current node to the next node in the queue.
     - Add the left and right children of the current node to the queue.
   - After processing all nodes at the current level, set the next pointer of the last node in the queue to `NULL` to indicate the end of the level.

3. **Return the root**: Once all levels have been processed, return the root node.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
from collections import deque

def populationNext Pointers(root):
    if root is None:
        return root

    queue = deque([root])

            if current left:
                queue.append(current left)
            if current right:

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize an empty list `triangle` to hold the rows.
2. For each row `i` from 0 to `numRows - 1`:
   - Create a new row with `i + 1` elements.
   - Set the first and last elements of the row to 1.
   - For each element in the row from the second to the second-to-last, set it to the sum of the two elements directly above it in the previous row.

For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index `i` on the current row, you may move to either index `i` or index `i + 1` on the next row.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the minimum path sum from the top to the bottom of a triangle, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to start from the top and work our way down, at each step choosing the minimum of the two adjacent numbers in the row below.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the dynamic programming table**: We can use the given triangle itself to store the minimum path sums at each position. Let's call this table `dp`. Initially, `dp[i][j]` will be equal to `triangle[i][j]` for all `i` and `j`.

2. **Iterate from the second row to the bottom**: For each row `i` from 1 to `n-1` (where `n` is the number of rows in the triangle), and for each position `j` in row `i` (which ranges from 0 to `i`), update `dp[i][j]` to be the minimum of `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i-1][j-1]` plus the value of `triangle[i][j]`.

3. **Find the minimum path sum at the bottom**: After iterating through all the rows, the minimum path sum from the top to the bottom will be the minimum value in the last row of `dp`.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:

def minimum_path_sum(triangle):

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling a stock at different days. The key is to find the minimum price at which we can buy the stock and the maximum price at which we can sell it in the future.

We can use a two-pointer approach to solve this problem. We will keep track of the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit that can be achieved.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize two variables: `min_price` to store the minimum price seen so far and `max_profit` to store the maximum profit that can be achieved. Set `min_price` to the first element of the `prices` array and `max_profit` to 0.
2. Iterate through the `prices` array starting from the second element.
3. For each element, update `min_price` if the current price is less than the current `min_price`.
4. Calculate the profit if we sell the stock on the current day and update `max_profit` if the current profit is greater than the current `max_profit`.
5. After iterating through the entire array, `max_profit` will contain the maximum profit that can be achieved.

Let's implement this approach in Python:
Response: python
def max_profit(prices):
    min_price = prices[0]
    max_profit = 0
    for price in prices[1:]:
        min_price = min(min_price, price)
        profit = price - min_price
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)

# Example 1

**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,6,4,3,1\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 105`
Attacked Question: You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete **at most two transactions**.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = \[1,2,3,4,5\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,6,4,3,1\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 105`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the maximum profit with at most two transactions, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will keep track of the maximum profit we can achieve after each day, considering the constraints of the problem.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit we can achieve after `i` days with `j` transactions.
   - We need to consider three states: `dp[i][0]` (no transactions), `dp[i][1]` (one transaction), and `dp[i][2]` (two transactions).

2. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[0][0] = 0` (no transactions on the first day).
   - `dp[0][1] = -prices[0]` (one transaction on the first day, we buy the stock).
   - `dp[0][2] = -prices[0]` (two transactions on the first day, we buy the stock).

3. **Transition Rules:**
   - For `dp[i][0]` (no transactions):
     \[
     dp[i][0] = \max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2])
     \]
     Since we are not making any transactions, the maximum profit remains the same as the previous day.
   - For `dp[i][1]` (one transaction):
     \[
     dp[i][1] = \max(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][0] + prices[i])
     \]
     We can either keep the same number of transactions or buy the stock on the current day.
   - For `dp[i][2]` (two transactions):
     \[
     dp[i][2] = \max(dp[i-1][2], dp[i-1][1] + prices[i])
     \]
     We can either keep the same number of transactions or sell the stock on the current day.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The maximum profit after all days with at most two transactions is `dp[n-1][2]`.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def maxProfit(prices):
    n = len(prices)
    dp = [[0] * 3 for _ in range(n)]
    
    dp[0][0] = 0
    dp[0][1] = -prices[0]
    dp[0][2] = -prices[0]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2])
        dp[i][1] = max(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][0] + prices[i])
        dp[i][2] = max(dp[i-1][2], dp[i-1][1] + prices[i])
    
    return dp[n-1][2]

# Example usage
prices = [3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 3, 1, 4]

Original Question: A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** 6

CoT: To find the maximum path sum in a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We need to keep track of the maximum path sum found so far and update it as we explore the tree.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Define a recursive function** to perform the DFS. This function will take a node as input and return the maximum path sum that can be formed starting from that node.
2. **Base Case**: If the node is `None`, return 0.
3. **Recursive Case**: For each child of the current node, recursively call the DFS function and get the maximum path sum from each child.
4. **Calculate the maximum path sum** that includes the current node. This is the sum of the current node's value and the maximum path sum from its left and right children. Update the maximum path sum found so far if this sum is greater.
5. **Return the maximum path sum** from the current node, which is the maximum of the sums from its left and right children plus the current node's value.

Here's the Python code to implement this approach:

    max_sum = float('-inf')

Original Question: A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk` such that:

*   Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
*   Every `si` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
*   `sk == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return _all the **shortest transformation sequences** from_ `beginWord` _to_ `endWord`_, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words_ `[beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** beginWord =  "hit ", endWord =  "cog ", wordList = \[ "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "lot ", "log ", "cog "\]
**Output:** \[\[ "hit ", "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "cog "\],\[ "hit ", "hot ", "lot ", "log ", "cog "\]\]
**Explanation:** There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
 "hit " ->  "hot " ->  "dot " ->  "dog " ->  "cog "
 "hit " ->  "hot " ->  "lot " ->  "log " ->  "cog "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** beginWord =  "hit ", endWord =  "cog ", wordList = \[ "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "lot ", "log "\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** The endWord  "cog " is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= beginWord.length <= 5`
*   `endWord.length == beginWord.length`
*   `1 <= wordList.length <= 500`
*   `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
*   `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
*   `beginWord != endWord`
*   All the words in `wordList` are **unique**.
*   The **sum** of all shortest transformation sequences does not exceed `105`.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all shortest transformation sequences from `begin word` to `end word` using a given dictionary `wordList`, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize a queue and a set for visited words:**
   - Start with the `begin word` in the queue.
   - Create a set to keep track of visited words to avoid processing the same word multiple times.

2. **Define a function to get all neighbors of a word:**
   - A neighbor of a word is another word that differs by exactly one letter.
   - Iterate through each letter in the word and replace it with every other letter in the alphabet to generate all possible neighbors.

3. **Perform BFS:**
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Dequeue a word from the queue.
     - If the word is the `end word`, add the current transformation sequence to the result list.
     - If the word has not been visited, mark it as visited and add all its neighbors to the queue.

4. **Return the result:**
   - If the `end word` is found, return the list of all shortest transformation sequences.
   - Otherwise, return an empty list.

Here's the Python code implementing the above algorithm:

1. Create an empty set `num_set` to store the elements of the array.
2. Iterate through each element `num` in the array.
3. For each element `num`, check if `num - 1` is in the set. If it is not, then `num` is the start of a new consecutive sequence.
4. If `num - 1` is not in the set, iterate through the next elements starting from `num` and check if they are in the set. Keep a count of the length of the consecutive sequence.
5. Update the maximum length of the consecutive sequence found so far.

Original Question: You are given the `root` of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

*   For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.

Return _the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers_. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

A **leaf** node is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** 25
**Explanation:**
The root-to-leaf path `1->2` represents the number `12`.
The root-to-leaf path `1->3` represents the number `13`.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = `25`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[4,9,0,5,1\]
**Output:** 1026
**Explanation:**
The root-to-leaf path `4->9->5` represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path `4->9->1` represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path `4->0` represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = `1026`.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
*   The depth of the tree will not exceed `10`.

*   `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
*   The depth of the tree will not exceed `10`.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers in a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will recursively遍历 the tree, keeping track of the current number formed by the path from the root to the current node.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Define a recursive function** that takes a node and the current number formed by the path from the root to the current node.
2. **Base Case**: If the current node is a leaf (i.e., it has no children), add the current number to the total sum.
3. **Recursive Case**: If the current node is not a leaf, recursively call the function for each child node, updating the current number by appending the value of the child node to the current number.

Let's implement this approach in Python:
Response: python
def sum_of_root_to_leaf_numbers(root):
    def dfs(node, current_number):
        if not node:
            return 0

            return current_number
        current_number = current_number * 10 + node val
        return dfs(node left, current_number) + dfs(node right, current_number)

Original Question: Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, _capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by_ `'X'`.

A region is **captured** by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[ "X ", "X ", "X ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "O ", "O ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "X ", "O ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "O ", "X ", "X "\]\]
**Output:** \[\[ "X ", "X ", "X ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "X ", "X ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "X ", "X ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "O ", "X ", "X "\]\]
**Explanation:** Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\[ "X "\]\]
**Output:** \[\[ "X "\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.

*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.
CoT: To solve the problem of capturing all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X' in an `m x n` matrix `board` containing 'X' and 'O', we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The idea is to iterate through each cell in the matrix and if we find an 'O' that is surrounded by 'X', we will flip it and all other 'O's in the same region to 'X'. We need to ensure that we do not flip any 'O's that are on the border or adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define a function ` capture regions` that takes the matrix `board` as input.**

2. **Define a function ` dfs` that performs a depth-first search starting from a given cell `(i, j)`. This function will mark all cells in the region as visited and flip their values from 'O' to 'X'.**

3. **Iterate through each cell in the matrix. If a cell contains an 'O', check if it is surrounded by 'X'. If it is, call ` dfs` on that cell.**

4. **To check if a cell is surrounded by 'X', we need to check its four neighbors (top, bottom, left, right). If any of the neighbors are 'O', then the cell is not surrounded by 'X' and should not be flipped.**

5. **After iterating through all cells, the matrix `board` will contain the captured regions.**

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def capture_regions(board):
    m, n = len(board), len(board[0])
    
    def dfs(i, j):
        if i < 0 or i >= m or j < 0 or j >= n or board[i][j]!= 'O':
            return
        board[i][j] = 'X'
        dfs(i + 1, j)
        dfs(i - 1, j)
        dfs(i, j + 1)
        dfs(i, j - 1)
    
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if board[i][j] == 'O':
                if i == 0 or i == m - 1 or j == 0 or j == n - 1:
                    # The cell is on the border, so it is not flipped.
                else:
                    dfs(i, j)
    
    return board

# Example usage

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 16`
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding all possible palindrome partitioning of a given string `s`, we can use a backtracking approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Define a function to check if a substring is a palindrome:**
   - A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.
   - We can use a two-pointer approach to check if a substring is a palindrome.

2. **Define a function to generate all possible palindrome partitions:**
   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible partitions.
   - We will keep track of the current partition and recursively add palindromic substrings to it.
   - When we reach the end of the string, we add the current partition to the result.

3. **Implement the backtracking function:**
   - Start with an empty partition.
   - Iterate through the string from the current position to the end.
   - For each position, check if the substring from the current position to the current index is a palindrome.
   - If it is a palindrome, add it to the current partition and recursively call the backtracking function with the next position.
   - After the recursive call, remove the last added substring from the current partition to backtrack.

4. **Combine the results:**
   - After the backtracking function returns, combine all the partitions into a list.

Here's the Python code that implements the above approach:
Response: python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def generate_palindrome_partitions(s, start, partitions, result):

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of cuts needed to partition a string `s` into palindromes, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define a function `is_palindrome` to check if a given substring is a palindrome and then use a dynamic programming array `dp` to store the minimum number of cuts needed for each substring.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the `is_palindrome` function:**
   - Check if the start and end indices are the same.
   - Iterate from the start to the middle of the substring and compare characters at corresponding positions.

2. **Initialize the dynamic programming array `dp`:**
   - Set `dp[i]` to 0 if `i` is equal to the length of the string.
   - Set `dp[i]` to 1 if the substring from `i` to the length of the string is a palindrome.
   - For each `i` from `n-2` to 0, find the minimum number of cuts needed by checking all possible partitions and using the previously computed values in `dp`.

3. **Iterate through the string and fill the `dp` array:**
   - For each `i` from `n-2` to 0, set `dp[i]` to the minimum of `dp[i+1]` and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j` from `i` to `n-1` such that the substring from `i` to `j` is a palindrome.

4. **Return the value of `dp[0]` which represents the minimum number of cuts needed for the entire string.**

Here is the Python code implementing the above steps:
Response: python
def is_palindrome(s, start, end):
    while start < end:
        if s[start]!= s[end]:
            return False
        start += 1
        end -= 1
    return True

Original Question: Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

CoT: To solve the problem of克隆 a given node in a connected undirected graph, we need to create a new graph that is a deep copy of the original graph. This means that each node in the new graph will have the same value and the same neighbors as the corresponding node in the original graph.

Here is a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Initialize the new graph**: Create a new graph with the same number of nodes as the original graph. Each node in the new graph will have a value and a list of neighbors.

2. **Set the value of the new node**: The value of the new node should be the same as the value of the given node.

3. **Set the neighbors of the new node**: Iterate through the neighbors of the given node in the original graph and add each neighbor to the list of neighbors of the new node.

4. **Return the new graph**: Once the new graph is fully initialized, return it as a reference.

Here is the Python code to implement this approach:

def克隆图(adjList, start node):
    # Step 1: Initialize the new graph
    new_graph = [None] * len(adjList)

        'val': adjList[start node - 1][0],
        'neighbors': []
    }
    
    # Step 3: Set the neighbors of the new node

Original Question: There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `ith` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith` station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return _the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return_ `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**

**Example 1:**

**Input:** gas = \[1,2,3,4,5\], cost = \[3,4,5,1,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** gas = \[2,3,4\], cost = \[3,4,3\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == gas.length == cost.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104`
Attacked Question: There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `ith` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith` station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return _the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return_ `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**

**Example 1:**

**Input:** gas = \[1,2,3,4,5\], cost = \[3,4,5,1,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** gas = \[2,3,4\], cost = \[3,4,3\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == gas.length == cost.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start at each gas station and check if we can complete the circuit by traveling clockwise. If we can, we return the starting index. If we can't, we move to the next gas station and repeat the process until we find a valid starting point or determine that no valid starting point exists.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable `total_gas` to store the total amount of gas available and a variable `total_cost` to store the total cost of traveling around the circuit.
2. Initialize a variable `current_gas` to store the current amount of gas in the tank, starting with 0.
3. Initialize a variable `start_index` to store the starting gas station's index, starting with 0.
4. Iterate through each gas station from 0 to `n-1`.
   - Add the gas at the current gas station to `total_gas`.
   - Add the cost at the current gas station to `total_cost`.
   - Subtract the cost at the current gas station from `current_gas`.
   - If `current_gas` becomes negative, set `start_index` to the next gas station and reset `current_gas` to 0.
5. After the loop, check if `total_gas` is less than `total_cost`. If it is, return -1, indicating that it is not possible to travel around the circuit.
6. Otherwise, return `start_index`.

Here is the Python code implementing the algorithm:
Response: python
def find_starting_gas_station(gas, cost):
    n = len(gas)
    total_gas = sum(gas)
    total_cost = sum(cost)
    current_gas = 0
    start_index = 0

    for i in range(n):
        total_gas += gas[i]
        total_cost += cost[i]
        current_gas -= cost[i]
        if current_gas < 0:
            start_index = i + 1
            current_gas = 0

    if total_gas < total_cost:
        return -1
    else:
        return start_index

Original Question: There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

**Constraints:**

*   `n == ratings.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
*   `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104`
CoT: To solve the problem of distributing candies to children based on their ratings, we need to ensure that each child gets at least one candy and that children with higher ratings get more candies than their neighbors. We can achieve this by iterating through the ratings array twice: once from left to right and once from right to left.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize the candies array:**
   Create an array `candies` of the same length as ` ratings` and initialize all elements to 1. This ensures that each child gets at least one candy.

2. ** Iterate from left to right:**
   For each child from the second child to the last child, if the current child's rating is higher than the previous child's rating, we set the current child's candies to be one more than the previous child's candies. This ensures that children with higher ratings get more candies than their left neighbors.

3. ** Iterate from right to left:**
   For each child from the second last child to the first child, if the current child's rating is higher than the next child's rating, we set the current child's candies to be one more than the next child's candies. This ensures that children with higher ratings get more candies than their right neighbors.

4. ** Calculate the total number of candies:**
   Sum up all the elements in the `candies` array to get the minimum number of candies needed.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def min_candies(ratings):
    n = len(ratings)
    candies = [1] * n  # Initialize candies array with 1s

    # Iterate from left to right
    for i in range(1, n):
        if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]:
            candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1

    # Iterate from right to left
    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
        if ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]:
            candies[i] = candies[i+1] + 1

    # Calculate the total number of candies
    total_candies = sum(candies)

*   `-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104`
*   Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the single element that appears only once in a non-empty array where every other element appears twice, we can use the XOR operation. The XOR operation has the property that any number XORed with itself is zero, and any number XORed with zero is the number itself. Therefore, if we XOR all the elements in the array, the elements that appear twice will cancel each other out, leaving us with the single element that appears only once.

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. Initialize a variable `result` to 0.
2. Iterate through each element in the array `nums`.
3. For each element, XOR it with the current value of `result`.
4. After iterating through all elements, the value of `result` will be the single element that appears only once.

Let's implement this in Python:

def find single element(nums):
    result = 0

Original Question: A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` **brand new** nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node.

*   All the strings of `wordDict` are **unique**.
CoT: To solve the problem of checking if a given string `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize a DP Array:**
   - Create a boolean array `dp` of size `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - Set `dp[0]` to `True` because an empty string can always be segmented (by definition).

2. **Iterate Through the String:**
   - For each position `i` from 1 to `n` in the string `s`, check if there exists a word in the dictionary `word_dict` that can be placed at the beginning of the string such that the remaining part of the string can be segmented.
   - Specifically, for each word `word` in `word_dict`, check if `s[i - len(word)]` is a valid position (i.e., `dp[i - len(word)]` is `True`) and if the word `word` matches the substring `s[i - len(word): i]`.

3. **Update the DP Array:**
   - If a valid word is found, set `dp[i]` to `True`.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The final answer is `dp[n]`, which indicates whether the entire string `s` can be segmented into dictionary words.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:
Response: python
def can_segment_string(s, word_dict):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [False] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = True

        for word in word_dict:
            if i >= len(word) and dp[i - len(word)] and s[i - len(word): i] == word:
                dp[i] = True
                break

**Output:** \[\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 20`
*   `1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 10`
*   `s` and `wordDict[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.
*   All the strings of `wordDict` are **unique**.
*   Input is generated in a way that the length of the answer doesn't exceed 105.
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to explore all possible ways to segment the string `s` using the words from the dictionary `wordDict`. We will use a list to store all possible sentences.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the recursive function**: The function will take the current index of the string `s` and the current sentence being built. If the current index reaches the end of the string, we add the current sentence to the list of possible sentences.

2. ** Iterate through the dictionary**: For each word in the dictionary, check if the word starting at the current index is a valid segment of the string `s`. If it is, we update the current sentence by adding the word and recursively call the function with the next index.

3. **Base case**: If the current index reaches the end of the string, we add the current sentence to the list of possible sentences.

4. **Recursive case**: If the current index does not reach the end of the string, we iterate through the dictionary and update the current sentence for each valid word.

Here is the Python code implementing the above approach:
Response: python
def word Segmentation(s, word_dict):
    def backtrack(index, sentence):
        if index == len(s):
            result.append(sentence)
            return
        for word in word_dict:
            if s[index: index + len(word)] == word:
                backtrack(index + len(word), sentence + " " + word)
    
    result = []
    backtrack(0, "")
    return result

# Example usage
s = "catsanddog"
word_dict = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"]
print(word Segmentation(s, word_dict))

Original Question: Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[3,2,0,-4\], pos = 1
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[1,2\], pos = 0
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[1\], pos = -1
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
*   `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

CoT: To determine if a linked list has a cycle in it, we can use the **Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm** (also known as the **tortoise and the hare** algorithm). This algorithm uses two pointers, one moving twice as fast as the other. If there is a cycle, the faster pointer (the hare) will eventually catch up to the slower pointer (the tortoise).

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. Initialize two pointers, `tortoise` and `hare`, both starting at the head of the list.
2. Move the `tortoise` one step at a time and the `hare` two steps at a time.
3. If the `hare` reaches the end of the list or meets the `tortoise`, there is a cycle. Otherwise, there is no cycle.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head, pos):
        # Initialize two pointers
        tortoise = head
        hare = head

        while hare!= None and hare!= tortoise:
            tortoise = tortoise.next
            hare = hare.next

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the node where the cycle begins in a linked list, we can use the **Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm**. This algorithm uses two pointers, a ** fast pointer** and a ** slow pointer**, to detect and find the start of the cycle.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with both the fast pointer and the slow pointer at the head of the linked list.
2. **Move Pointers**: Move the fast pointer two steps at a time and the slow pointer one step at a time. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer.
3. **Find the Start of the Cycle**: Once the fast pointer catches up to the slow pointer, move the slow pointer back to the head of the list and move both pointers one step at a time until they meet again. The point where they meet is the start of the cycle.

CoT: To solve the problem of reordering a singly linked list such that the elements are in the form \(L0 \rightarrow Ln \rightarrow L1 \rightarrow Ln-1 \rightarrow L2 \rightarrow Ln-2 \rightarrow \ldots\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of the list**: We need to know the total number of nodes in the list to split it into two halves.

2. **Split the list into two halves**: Once we know the length, we can split the list into two parts. The first part will contain the first half of the nodes, and the second part will contain the second half of the nodes.

3. **Reverse the second half**: We need to reverse the order of the nodes in the second half.

CoT: To implement an LRU cache in Python, we can use a combination of a dictionary to store the key-value pairs and a list to keep track of the order of the keys. The list will be used to determine the least recently used key. When the number of keys exceeds the capacity, we will remove the least recently used key from the list.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Initialize the LRU cache:**
   - Create an empty dictionary ` cache` to store the key-value pairs.
   - Create an empty list ` order` to keep track of the order of the keys.
   - Set the ` capacity` of the cache.

2. **Implement the ` get ` function:**
   - If the key is not in the dictionary, return `-1`.
   - If the key is in the dictionary, remove it from the list and return its value.

3. **Implement the ` put ` function:**
   - If the key is already in the dictionary, update its value and move it to the front of the list.
   - If the key is not in the dictionary, add it to the dictionary and the list. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity, remove the least recently used key (the last element in the list).

Original Question: Given the `head` of a singly linked list, sort the list using **insertion sort**, and return _the sorted list's head_.

The steps of the **insertion sort** algorithm:

1.  Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list.
2.  At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list and inserts it there.
3.  It repeats until no input elements remain.

The following is a graphical example of the insertion sort algorithm. The partially sorted list (black) initially contains only the first element in the list. One element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list with each iteration.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[4,2,1,3\]
**Output:** \[1,2,3,4\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[-1,5,3,4,0\]
**Output:** \[-1,0,3,4,5\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5000]`.
*   `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

CoT: To implement the insertion sort algorithm for a singly linked list in Python, we need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new head for the sorted list.
2. Iterate through the original list, removing each element and inserting it into the sorted list in the correct position.

Here is the Python code to achieve this:

**Follow up:** Can you sort the linked list in `O(n logn)` time and `O(1)` memory (i.e. constant space)?
CoT: To sort a linked list in ascending order, we can use a ** merge sort** algorithm. Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\) and a space complexity of \(O(n)\). However, since we are dealing with a linked list, we can modify the algorithm to use constant extra space.

Here is the step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Find the middle of the list**: Use the **tortoise and hare** algorithm to find the middle of the linked list.
2. **Divide the list**: Split the list into two halves at the middle.
3. **Sort the halves**: Recursively sort the two halves.
4. **Merge the halves**: Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted list.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self val = val
        self next = next

def sortList(head):
    if head is None or head.next is None:
        return head

    # Step 1: Find the middle of the list
    slow = head
    fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next next

    # Step 2: Divide the list into two halves
    mid = slow
    second_half = mid next
    mid next = None

    # Step 3: Sort the halves
    sorted_first_half = sortList(head)
    sorted_second_half = sortList(second_half)

    # Step 4: Merge the halves
    return merge(sorted_first_half, sorted_second_half)

def merge(a, b):
    if a is None:
        return b
    if b is None:
        return a

    if a val < b val:
        a next = merge(a next, b)
        return a
    else:
        b next = merge(a, b next)
        return b

# Example usage
# Create a linked list: 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3

CoT: To determine the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line, we can use a slope-based approach. For each pair of points, we calculate the slope of the line they form. If two pairs of points have the same slope, they lie on the same line.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize a dictionary to store the slopes and their counts.**
2. **Iterate through each pair of points.**
3. **Calculate the slope of the line formed by the pair of points.**
4. **If the slope is already in the dictionary, increment its count.**
5. **If the slope is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1.**

**Example 1:**

**Input:** tokens = \[ "2 ", "1 ", "+ ", "3 ", "\* "\]
**Output:** 9
**Explanation:** ((2 + 1) \* 3) = 9

CoT: To evaluate an arithmetic expression given in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), we can use a stack to keep track of the intermediate results. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize an empty stack.

*   The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.
CoT: To find the subarray with the largest product in an integer array `nums`, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We need to keep track of the maximum and minimum product of subarrays ending at each position because a negative number can change the sign of the product.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize two variables, `max_product` and `min_product`, to the first element of the array.
2. Initialize a variable `result` to the first element of the array.
3. Iterate through the array from the second element to the end.
4. For each element, update `max_product` and `min_product` by considering the current element and the previous `max_product` and `min_product`.
5. Update `result` with the maximum value between `result` and `max_product`.
6. Return `result`.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def max_product_subarray(nums):
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return nums[0]

    max_product = nums[0]
    min_product = nums[0]

Original Question: Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

*   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
*   `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

**Explanation:** The original array was \[1,2,3,4,5\] rotated 3 times.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,6,7,0,1,2\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The original array was \[0,1,2,4,5,6,7\] and it was rotated 4 times.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[11,13,15,17\]
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** The original array was \[11,13,15,17\] and it was rotated 4 times. 

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 5000`
*   `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
*   All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.
Attacked Question: Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

*   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
*   `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time.`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,4,5,1,2\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The original array was \[1,2,3,4,5\] rotated 3 times.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[11,13,15,17\]

**Explanation:** The original array was \[11,13,15,17\] and it was rotated 4 times.

*   `1 <= n <= 5000`
*   `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
*   All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.
CoT: To find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array in \( O(\log n) \) time, we can use a binary search approach. The key observation is that in a rotated sorted array, the minimum element is the only element that is smaller than its previous element.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. ** Initialize two pointers **: `left` and `right` to the start and end of the array respectively.
2. ** While `left < right` **:
   - ** Find the middle point **: `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`.
   - ** Check if the middle element is the minimum **:
     - If `mid` is greater than `right` (i.e., the array is rotated more than half a rotation), the minimum element must be in the right half. So, set `left = mid + 1`.
     - If `mid` is less than or equal to `right` and `nums[mid] < nums[mid - 1]` (i.e., the middle element is smaller than its previous element), then `nums[mid]` is the minimum element. So, return `nums[mid]`.
     - If `mid` is less than or equal to `right` and `nums[mid] >= nums[mid - 1]` (i.e., the middle element is not smaller than its previous element), then the minimum element must be in the left half. So, set `right = mid`.
3. ** When `left == right` **: The minimum element is `nums[left]`.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def find_min_in_rotated_array(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if mid > right:
            left += 1
        elif nums[mid] < nums[mid - 1]:
            return nums[mid]
        else:
            right = mid
    return nums[left]

# Example usage
nums1 = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
print(find_min_in_rotated_array(nums1))  # Output: 1

nums2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]
print(find_min_in_rotated_array(nums2))  # Output: 0

CoT: To find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array that may contain duplicates, we can use a modified binary search approach. The key idea is to use the properties of the sorted and rotated array to determine which half of the array to search in.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. ** Initialize two pointers **: `left` and `right` to the start and end of the array respectively.
2. ** While `left < right` **:
   - ** Find the middle point **: `mid = (left + right) // 2`.
   - ** Check if the middle element is the minimum **:
     - If `nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]`, then `nums[mid]` is the minimum element.
     - If `nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]`, then the minimum element is in the right half of the array. Update `left` to `mid + 1`.
     - If `nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]`, then we cannot determine which half the minimum element is in based on the middle element alone. In this case, we need to check the entire array, but we can reduce the search space by incrementing `left` by 1.
3. ** When `left == right` **: The minimum element is `nums[left]`.

Original Question: Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the `MinStack` class:

*   `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
*   `void push(int val)` pushes the element `val` onto the stack.
*   `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
*   `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.
*   `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with `O(1)` time complexity for each function.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "MinStack ", "push ", "push ", "push ", "getMin ", "pop ", "top ", "getMin "\]
\[\[\],\[-2\],\[0\],\[-3\],\[\],\[\],\[\],\[\]\]

CoT: To design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time, we can use two stacks: one to store the elements and another to store the minimum values up to the current top of the first stack. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Initialize two stacks**: `stack` to store the elements and `min_stack` to store the minimum values up to the current top of `stack`.
2. **Push an element**: When an element `val` is pushed onto `stack`, we also need to update `min_stack`:
   - If `min_stack` is empty or `val` is less than or equal to the top of `min_stack`, push `val` onto `min_stack`.
   - Otherwise, push the top of `min_stack` onto `min_stack`.
3. **Pop an element**: When an element is popped from `stack`, also pop the top of `min_stack` if the element popped is equal to the top of `min_stack`.
4. **Top an element**: When the top element is asked, return the top of `stack`.
5. **Get the minimum element**: When the minimum element is asked, return the top of `min_stack`.

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree, turn the tree upside down and return _the new root_.

You can turn a binary tree upside down with the following steps:

1.  The original left child becomes the new root.
2.  The original root becomes the new right child.
3.  The original right child becomes the new left child.

The mentioned steps are done level by level. It is **guaranteed** that every right node has a sibling (a left node with the same parent) and has no children.

Difficulty: Easy
Original Question: Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method to read `n` characters.

**Method read4:**

The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

File file( "abcde `"); // File is  "`abcde `", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  "abcd ", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  "e ", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  " ", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The `read` function will only be called once for each test case.
*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** file =  "abc ", n = 4
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abc ". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
Note that  "abc " is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** file =  "abcde ", n = 5
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abcde ". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** file =  "abcdABCD1234 ", n = 12
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abcdABCD1234 ". We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12.

**Constraints:**

**Constraints:**

*   `file` consist of English letters and digits.
*   `1 <= n <= 1000`
CoT: To implement the `read` method using the `read4` method, we need to repeatedly call `read4` until we have read `n` characters. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of characters read.
2. Initialize a variable `i` to keep track of the current position in the file.
3. While `count` is less than `n` and `i` is less than the length of the file:
   - Call `read4,buf4` to read 4 characters starting from position `i`.
   - Add the number of characters read to `count`.
   - Update `i` to `i + 4`.
4. If `count` is less than `n`, it means we need to read more characters from the file. Since we can only read 4 characters at a time, we need to handle the remaining characters.
5. If `count` is equal to `n`, it means we have read exactly `n` characters.

Here's the Python code to implement the `read` method:
Response: python
def read(buf, n):
    count = 0
    i = 0
    while count < n and i < len(buf):
        buf4 = [0] * 4
        read4(buf4)
        for j in range(min(4, len(buf))):
            if i < len(buf):
                buf[j] = buf4[j]
                count += 1
                i += 1
            else:
                break
    return count

File file( "abcde `"); // File is  "`abcde `", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  "abcd ", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  "e ", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  " ", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The read function may be **called multiple times**.
*   Please remember to **RESET** your class variables declared in Solution, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see [here](https://leetcode.com/faq/) for more details.
*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.
*   It is guaranteed that in a given test case the same buffer `buf` is called by `read`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** file =  "abc ", queries = \[1,2,1\]
**Output:** \[1,2,0\]
**Explanation:** The test case represents the following scenario:
File file( "abc ");
Solution sol;
sol.read(buf, 1); // After calling your read method, buf should contain  "a ". We read a total of 1 character from the file, so return 1.
sol.read(buf, 2); // Now buf should contain  "bc ". We read a total of 2 characters from the file, so return 2.
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
Assume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** file =  "abc ", queries = \[4,1\]
**Output:** \[3,0\]
**Explanation:** The test case represents the following scenario:
File file( "abc ");
Solution sol;
sol.read(buf, 4); // After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abc ". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= file.length <= 500`
*   `file` consist of English letters and digits.
*   `1 <= queries.length <= 10`
*   `1 <= queries[i] <= 500`
Attacked Question: Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method `read` to read `n` characters. Your method `read` may be **called multiple times**.

**Method read4:**

The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

File file( "abcde `"); // File is  "`abcde `", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  "abcd ", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  "e ", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  " ", fp points to end of file`

*   `1 <= queries.length <= 10`
*   `1 <= queries[i] <= 500`
CoT: To implement the `read` method using the `read4` method, we need to carefully manage the reading process and ensure that we can read exactly `n` characters from the file. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Create a variable `i` to keep track of the current position in the file.
   - Create a variable `count` to keep track of the number of characters read so far.

2. **Loop Through Queries:**
   - For each query `n`, we need to read `n` characters from the file.
   - Use the `read4` method to read 4 characters at a time.
   - Update the `count` variable after each call to `read4`.
   - If `count` reaches or exceeds `n`, break out of the loop.

3. **Handle Remaining Characters:**
   - If `count` is less than `n` after reading all possible 4-character blocks, read the remaining characters from the file.
   - Update the `count` variable.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - Return the `count` variable.

Here's the Python code implementing the above approach:
Response: python
def read(buf, n):
    i = 0  # Current position in the file
    count = 0  # Number of characters read so far

    while count < n:
        # Read 4 characters at a time
        read4(buf[i:i+4])
        count += 4
        i += 4

        # If count reaches or exceeds n, break out of the loop
        if count >= n:
            break

    # If count is less than n, read the remaining characters
    remaining = n - count
    read4(buf[i:i+remaining])
    count += remaining

    return count

Original Question: Given a string `s`, return _the length of the longest_ _substring_ _that contains at most **two distinct characters**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "eceba "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The substring is  "ece " which its length is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "ccaabbb "
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The substring is  "aabbb " which its length is 5.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`
*   `s` consists of English letters.
Attacked Question: Given a string `s`, return _the length of the longest_ _substring_ _that contains at most **two distinct characters**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "eceba "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The substring is  "ece " which its length is 3.

**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The substring is  "aabbb " which its length is 5.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`
*   `s` consists of English letters.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the length of the longest substring that contains at most two distinct characters in a given string `s`, we can use a sliding window approach. This approach involves maintaining a window of characters that can expand and shrink as we iterate through the string.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `max_length`: This will store the length of the longest valid substring found so far.
   - `left`: This will be the left boundary of the sliding window.
   - `right`: This will be the right boundary of the sliding window.
   - `char_count`: This will be a dictionary to keep track of the count of each character in the current window.

2. **Iterate Through the String:**
   - For each character `s[right]` in the string:
     - Increment the count of `s[right]` in `char_count`.
     - If the number of distinct characters in the window is greater than 2, we need to shrink the window from the left.
       - While the number of distinct characters is greater than 2, decrease the count of `s[left]` in `char_count` and increment `left`.
     - After shrinking the window, update `max_length` with the maximum of the current window length (`right - left + 1`) and the previous `max_length`.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - After iterating through the entire string, `max_length` will contain the length of the longest substring that contains at most two distinct characters.

Here is the Python code implementing the above approach:
Response: python
def length_of_longest_substring(s):
    max_length = 0
    left = 0
    char_count = {}
    
    for right in range(len(s)):
        char_count[s[right]] += 1
        
        while len(char_count) > 2:
            char_count[s[left]] -= 1
            if char_count[s[left]] == 0:
                del char_count[s[left]]
            left += 1
        
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_length

# Example usage
s1 = "eceba"
print(length_of_longest_substring(s1))  # Output: 3

s2 = "ccaabbb"
print(length_of_longest_substring(s2))  # Output: 5

Original Question: Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

*   `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
*   `listA` - The first linked list.
*   `listB` - The second linked list.
*   `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 8, listA = \[4,1,8,4,5\], listB = \[5,6,1,8,4,5\], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[4,1,8,4,5\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[5,6,1,8,4,5\]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 2, listA = \[1,9,1,2,4\], listB = \[3,2,4\], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
**Output:** Intersected at '2'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[1,9,1,2,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[3,2,4\]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = \[2,6,4\], listB = \[1,5\], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[2,6,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[1,5\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
*   The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
*   `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104`
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `0 <= skipA < m`
*   `0 <= skipB < n`
*   `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
*   `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that runs in `O(m + n)` time and use only `O(1)` memory?

**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[4,1,8,4,5\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[5,6,1,8,4,5\]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = \[2,6,4\], listB = \[1,5\], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[2,6,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[1,5\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
*   The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
*   `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104`
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `0 <= skipA < m`
*   `0 <= skipB < n`
*   `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
*   `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that runs in `O(m + n)` time and use only `O(1)` memory?
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the intersection of two singly linked lists, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers, one at the head of list A and the other at the head of list B.
2. **Move Pointers**: Move the pointer in list A `skipA` steps forward and the pointer in list B `skipB` steps forward. This ensures that both pointers are at the same relative position in their respective lists.
3. ** Iterate**: Continue moving both pointers forward until they either meet or reach the end of their respective lists.
4. **Check for Intersection**: If the two pointers meet, then the list they point to is the intersection. If they reach the end of their respective lists without meeting, then there is no intersection.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def find_intersection(headA, headB, skipA, skipB):
    # Initialize two pointers
    pointerA = headA
    pointerB = headB
    
    # Move the pointers forward by the specified number of steps
    for _ in range(skipA):
        pointerA = pointerA.next
    for _ in range(skipB):
        pointerB = pointerB.next
    
    # Iterate until the pointers meet or reach the end of their respective lists
    while pointerA and pointerB:
        if pointerA == pointerB:
            return pointerA
        pointerA = pointerA.next
        pointerB = pointerB.next
    
    # If the pointers do not meet, return None

*   `s` and `t` consist of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits.
CoT: To determine if two strings `s` and `t` are one edit distance apart, we need to check if we can transform `s` into `t` by performing exactly one of the following operations:

1. Insert a character into `s`.
2. Delete a character from `s`.
3. Replace a character in `s` with a different character.

We can use a two-pointer approach to compare the characters of `s` and `t` and count the number of differences. If the number of differences is exactly 1, then `s` and `t` are one edit distance apart. If the number of differences is more than 1, then `s` and `t` are not one edit distance apart.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

CoT: To find a peak element in a given array `nums` in `O(log n)` time, we can use a binary search approach. The key idea is to compare the middle element with its neighbors and eliminate half of the array based on the comparison.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize the search range:**
   - Set the left index `l` to 0.
   - Set the right index `r` to `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array.

2. ** Binary search loop:**
   - While `l <= r`, do the following:
     - Calculate the middle index `m` as `l + (r - l) // 2`.
     - Compare the middle element `nums[m]` with its neighbors `nums[m-1]` and `nums[m+1]`.
     - If `m` is a peak element (i.e., `nums[m] > nums[m-1]` and `nums[m] > nums[m+1]`), return `m`.
     - If `nums[m] < nums[m-1]`, then the peak element must be in the left half of the array. Set `r` to `m - 1`.
     - If `nums[m] < nums[m+1]`, then the peak element must be in the right half of the array. Set `l` to `m + 1`.

3. ** handle edge cases:**
   - If the array has only one element, that element is a peak element. Return the index of that element.
   - If the array has two elements, compare them and return the index of the larger element.

Here is the Python code implementing the above algorithm:
Response: python
def find_peak_element(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1 if nums[0] > nums[1] else 0
    
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    
    while l <= r:
        m = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if (m == 0 and nums[m] > nums[m+1]) or (m == n-1 and nums[m] > nums[m-1]):
            return m
        elif m > 0 and m < n-1 and nums[m] > nums[m-1] and nums[m] > nums[m+1]:
            return m
        elif m > 0 and nums[m] < nums[m-1]:
            r = m - 1
        else:
            l = m + 1

Original Question: You are given an inclusive range `[lower, upper]` and a **sorted unique** integer array `nums`, where all elements are in the inclusive range.

A number `x` is considered **missing** if `x` is in the range `[lower, upper]` and `x` is not in `nums`.

Return _the **smallest sorted** list of ranges that **cover every missing number exactly**_. That is, no element of `nums` is in any of the ranges, and each missing number is in one of the ranges.

1. **Sort the array**: Use a linear time sorting algorithm that uses linear extra space. One such algorithm is counting sort. Counting sort is efficient when the range of input data (the difference between the maximum and minimum elements) is not significantly greater than the number of elements.

Original Question: Given two version numbers, `version1` and `version2`, compare them.

Version numbers consist of **one or more revisions** joined by a dot `'.'`. Each revision consists of **digits** and may contain leading **zeros**. Every revision contains **at least one character**. Revisions are **0-indexed from left to right**, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example `2.5.33` and `0.1` are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in **left-to-right order**. Revisions are compared using their **integer value ignoring any leading zeros**. This means that revisions `1` and `001` are considered **equal**. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then **treat the revision as `0`**. For example, version `1.0` is less than version `1.1` because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are `0` and `1` respectively, and `0 < 1`.

_Return the following:_

*   If `version1 < version2`, return `-1`.
*   If `version1 > version2`, return `1`.
*   Otherwise, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** version1 =  "1.01 ", version2 =  "1.001 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** Ignoring leading zeroes, both  "01 " and  "001 " represent the same integer  "1 ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** version1 =  "1.0 ", version2 =  "1.0.0 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** version1 does not specify revision 2, which means it is treated as  "0 ".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** version1 =  "0.1 ", version2 =  "1.1 "
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** version1's revision 0 is  "0 ", while version2's revision 0 is  "1 ". 0 < 1, so version1 < version2.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= version1.length, version2.length <= 500`
*   `version1` and `version2` only contain digits and `'.'`.
*   `version1` and `version2` **are valid version numbers**.
*   All the given revisions in `version1` and `version2` can be stored in a **32-bit integer**.

CoT: To compare two version numbers, we need to break them down into their individual revisions and compare these revisions from left to right. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Split the version numbers into revisions:**
   - Use the `split` method to split `version1` and `version2` by the dot `."`.
   - This will give us two lists of strings, where each string is a revision.

2. ** Pad the shorter list with zeros:**
   - Determine the maximum length of the two lists.
   - Pad the shorter list with zeros to make both lists the same length.

3. **Compare the revisions:**
   - Iterate through the padded lists and compare each pair of revisions.
   - If a revision in `version1` is less than the corresponding revision in `version2`, return `-1`.
   - If a revision in `version1` is greater than the corresponding revision in `version2`, return `1`.
   - If all revisions are equal, return `0`.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def compare_versions(version1, version2):
    # Split the version numbers into revisions
    revisions1 = version1.split('.')
    revisions2 = version2.split('.')

    # Pad the shorter list with zeros
    max_length = max(len(revisions1), len(revisions2))
    revisions1 += ['0'] * (max_length - len(revisions1))
    revisions2 += ['0'] * (max_length - len(revisions2))

    # Compare the revisions
    for i in range(max_length):
        if int(revisions1[i]) < int(revisions2[i]):
            return -1
        elif int(revisions1[i]) > int(revisions2[i]):
            return 1

CoT: To solve the problem of converting a fraction to a string format, we need to handle both terminating and repeating decimals. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine the integer part of the fraction:**
   - If the numerator is negative, the integer part will be negative.
   - If the numerator is non-negative, the integer part will be non-negative.

2. **Convert the absolute value of the fraction to a string:**
   - Use integer division to find the integer part.
   - Use the modulus operation to find the remainder.
   - If the remainder is zero, the decimal part is zero.
   - If the remainder is non-zero, proceed to the next steps.

3. **Identify the repeating part:**
   - Use a dictionary to keep track of remainders and their positions in the decimal part.
   - If a remainder repeats, the decimal part has a repeating sequence.
   - If a remainder is zero, the decimal part is terminating.

4. ** format the decimal part:**
   - If there is a repeating sequence, enclose it in parentheses.
   - If there is no repeating sequence, do not enclose it in parentheses.

5. **Combine the integer part and the decimal part:**
   - If the integer part is zero, the result is just the decimal part.
   - If the integer part is non-zero, combine it with the decimal part.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a specific target, we can use a two-pointer approach. This approach is efficient because it only requires a single pass through the array and uses constant extra space.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, where `left` starts at the beginning of the array (index 0) and `right` starts at the end of the array (index `n-1`).
2. While `left` is less than `right`, do the following:
   - Calculate the sum of the numbers at the `left` and `right` pointers.
   - If the sum is equal to the target, return the indices `left+1` and `right+1` (since the indices are 1-indexed).
   - If the sum is less than the target, move the `left` pointer one step to the right (increase `left` by 1).
   - If the sum is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer one step to the left (decrease `right` by 1).
3. If the loop completes without finding a pair, return an empty array (this case should not happen given the problem constraints).

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python

Original Question: Given an integer `columnNumber`, return _its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet_.

For example:

A -> 1
B -> 2
C -> 3
...
Z -> 26
AA -> 27
AB -> 28 
...

**Example 1:**

**Input:** columnNumber = 1
**Output:**  "A "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** columnNumber = 28
**Output:**  "AB "

**Example 3:**

**Input:** columnNumber = 701
**Output:**  "ZY "

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= columnNumber <= 231 - 1`

**Output:**  "AB "

**Example 3:**

**Input:** columnNumber = 701
**Output:**  "ZY "

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= columnNumber <= 231 - 1`
CoT: To convert an integer `columnNumber` to its corresponding column title in an Excel sheet, we can use a base-26 numbering system. In this system, each digit corresponds to a letter in the English alphabet, where A represents 1, B represents 2, and so on up to Z, which represents 26. If the number is greater than 26, we repeat the process with the quotient and the remainder.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm to convert the integer to its corresponding column title:

1. Initialize an empty string ` title ` to store the column title.
2. While ` columnNumber ` is greater than 0, do the following:
   - Calculate the remainder of ` columnNumber ` divided by 26.
   - Convert the remainder to the corresponding letter in the English alphabet and append it to ` title `.
   - Update ` columnNumber ` to be the quotient of ` columnNumber ` divided by 26.
3. Reverse the string ` title ` to get the correct order of the letters.
4. Return the ` title `.

Here is the Python code to implement this algorithm:
Response: python
def convert_column_number_to_title(columnNumber):
    title = ""
    while columnNumber > 0:
        remainder = columnNumber % 26
        title += chr(64 + remainder)  # Convert remainder to corresponding letter (A=65, B=66,..., Z=90)
        columnNumber //= 26
    return title[::-1]  # Reverse the string

Original Question: Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return _the majority element_.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,3\]
**Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

Attacked Question: Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return _the majority element_.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,3\]
**Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

*   `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

**Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?
CoT: To find the majority element in an array `nums` of size `n` in linear time and `O(1)` space, we can use the ** boys and girls algorithm** (also known as the **majority vote algorithm**). This algorithm works by keeping track of a candidate for the majority element and a count of how many times this candidate has been seen so far.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning and Python code to solve the problem:

1. ** Initialize variables:**
   - `candidate`: This will store the current candidate for the majority element.
   - `count`: This will store the count of the current candidate.

2. ** Iterate through the array:**
   - For each element `num` in the array:
     - If `count` is 0, set `candidate` to `num` and `count` to 1.
     - If `count` is not 0, check if `num` is equal to `candidate`.
       - If `num` is equal to `candidate`, increment `count` by 1.
       - If `num` is not equal to `candidate`, decrement `count` by 1.

3. ** Return the candidate:**
   - After iterating through the array, the `candidate` will be the majority element.

Here is the Python code implementing the above algorithm:
Response: python
def find_majority_element(nums):
    candidate = None
    count = 0

    for num in nums:
        if count == 0:
            candidate = num
            count += 1
        else:
            if num == candidate:
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1

Original Question: Design a data structure that accepts a stream of integers and checks if it has a pair of integers that sum up to a particular value.

Implement the `TwoSum` class:

*   `TwoSum()` Initializes the `TwoSum` object, with an empty array initially.
*   `void add(int number)` Adds `number` to the data structure.
*   `boolean find(int value)` Returns `true` if there exists any pair of numbers whose sum is equal to `value`, otherwise, it returns `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "TwoSum ",  "add ",  "add ",  "add ",  "find ",  "find "\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[3\], \[5\], \[4\], \[7\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, null, true, false\]

**Explanation**
TwoSum twoSum = new TwoSum();

*   `columnTitle` consists only of uppercase English letters.
*   `columnTitle` is in the range `[ "A ", "FXSHRXW "]`.
CoT: To convert a column title in Excel to its corresponding column number, we need to understand that the column titles are based on a base-26 numbering system, where A corresponds to 1, B corresponds to 2, and so on up to Z, which corresponds to 26. After Z, the next column is AA, which corresponds to 27, AB corresponds to 28, and so on.

We can convert the column title to a column number by iterating through each character in the title from left to right. For each character, we calculate its position in the alphabet (A is 1, B is 2,..., Z is 26) and then multiply it by 26 raised to the power of its position in the title (starting from 0 for the first character).

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize a variable `columnNumber` to 0.
2. Iterate through each character in the `columnTitle`.
3. For each character, calculate its position in the alphabet by subtracting the ASCII value of 'A' from the ASCII value of the character and adding 1.
4. Multiply the position by 26 raised to the power of the current position in the title (starting from 0).
5. Add the result to `columnNumber`.
6. After iterating through all characters, `columnNumber` will contain the corresponding column number.

Here is the Python code to implement this:
Response: python
def column.title_to_number(columnTitle):
    columnNumber = 0
    for i, char in enumerate(columnTitle):
        position = ord(char) - ord('A') + 1
        columnNumber += position * (26 ** i)
    return columnNumber

# Example usage
print(column.title_to_number("A "))  # Output: 1
print(column.title_to_number("AB "))  # Output: 28

CoT: To determine the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \( 10 = 2 \times 5 \), and there are generally more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor.

We can do this by dividing \( n \) by 5, then dividing the quotient by 5 again, and so on, until the quotient is less than 5. The sum of these quotients gives us the number of trailing zeroes.

You may assume that `next()` calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next number in the in-order traversal when `next()` is called.

Original Question: The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in **the bottom-right corner** of a `dungeon`. The `dungeon` consists of `m x n` rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in **the top-left room** and must fight his way through `dungeon` to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to `0` or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).

To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only **rightward** or **downward** in each step.

Return _the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess_.

**Note** that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** dungeon = \[\[-2,-3,3\],\[-5,-10,1\],\[10,30,-5\]\]

CoT: To determine the minimum initial health the knight needs to rescue the princess, we can use dynamic programming. We will start from the bottom-right corner of the `dungeon` and work our way up to the top-left corner, calculating the minimum health required at each room.

Let's define `dp[i][j]` as the minimum initial health required to reach the bottom-right corner from room \((i, j)\).

The base case is:
- `dp[m-1][n-1] = max(1, -dungeon[m-1][n-1])`
  - If the princess is in the bottom-right room and it contains a demon, the knight needs at least 1 health to avoid dying.
  - If the princess is in the bottom-right room and it contains a magic orb, the knight can start with 0 health.

For the other rooms, we use the following recurrence relation:
- `dp[i][j] = max(1, max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1]) - dungeon[i][j])`
  - The knight can either move down or right.
  - The minimum initial health required at room \((i, j)\) is the maximum of:
    - 1 (to avoid dying)
    - The minimum initial health required at the next room minus the health change in room \((i, j)\)
    - The minimum initial health required at the next room in the same row or column.

Let's implement this approach in Python:
Response: python

Original Question: Given a list of non-negative integers `nums`, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.

Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[10,2\]
**Output:**  "210 "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,30,34,5,9\]
**Output:**  "9534330 "

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 109`

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 109`
CoT: To solve the problem of arranging a list of non-negative integers to form the largest number, we need to consider the custom comparison between two numbers. Instead of the usual numerical comparison, we should compare the numbers as if they were strings, but in a way that maximizes the value of the resulting number.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Convert each integer in the list to a string.**
2. **Define a custom comparison function that compares two strings `a` and `b` by checking which concatenation `ab` or `ba` forms a larger number.**
3. **Sort the list of strings using the custom comparison function.**
4. ** Join the sorted strings to form the largest number.**

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def custom comparison(a, b):
    return (b + a) > (a + b)

def largest_number(nums):
    # Convert each integer in the list to a string
    nums_str = [str(num) for num in nums]
    
    # Sort the list of strings using the custom comparison function
    nums_str.sort(key=lambda x: x * 100, reverse=True)
    
    # Join the sorted strings to form the largest number
    result = ''.join(nums_str)
    
    return result

# Example usage
nums = [10, 2]
print(largest_number(nums))  # Output: "210"

nums = [3, 30, 34, 5, 9]
print(largest_number(nums))  # Output: "9534330"

Original Question: Given a character array `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by a single space.

Your code must solve the problem **in-place,** i.e. without allocating extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = \["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"\]
**Output:** \["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = \["a"\]
**Output:** \["a"\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`
*   `s[i]` is an English letter (uppercase or lowercase), digit, or space `' '`.
*   There is **at least one** word in `s`.
*   `s` does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
*   All the words in `s` are guaranteed to be separated by a single space.

*   `s` does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
*   All the words in `s` are guaranteed to be separated by a single space.
CoT: To solve the problem of reversing the order of words in a character array `s` in Python, we can follow these steps:

1. **Reverse the entire string**: First, we reverse the entire string `s`. This will bring all the words in reverse order, but each word will still be in its original form.

2. **Convert words to individual characters**: Next, we convert the reversed string into a list of characters. This allows us to manipulate each character individually.

3. **Reverse each word**: We then iterate through the list of characters and reverse each word. Since each word is now a list of characters, we can use the `reverse()` method to reverse the order of the characters in each word.

4. **Convert back to a string**: Finally, we convert the list of characters back into a string. This gives us the final reversed order of the words.

Here is the Python code that implements these steps:
Response: python
def reverse_words(s):
    # Step 1: Reverse the entire string
    s = s[::-1]

    # Step 2: Convert words to individual characters
    words = list(s)

    # Step 3: Reverse each word
    for i in range(0, len(words)):
        if words[i] =='':
            words[i] = '`
        else:
            words[i] = words[i]

    # Step 4: Convert back to a string
    return ''.join(words)

# Example usage
s = ["t", "h", "e", " ", "s", "k", "y", " ", "i", "s", " ", "b", "l", "u", "e"]

Original Question: You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions: i.e. you may buy at most `k` times and sell at most `k` times.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 2, prices = \[2,4,1\]

**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= k <= 100`
*   `1 <= prices.length <= 1000`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit we can achieve with at most `j` transactions up to the `i`-th day.

The recurrence relation for `dp[i][j]` can be defined as follows:
- If we do not perform any transaction on the `i`-th day, the profit remains the same as the profit we can achieve with `j` transactions up to the `(i-1)`-th day.
- If we perform a transaction on the `i`-th day, we can either buy or sell the stock. If we buy the stock on the `i`-th day, the profit is the profit we can achieve with `j-1` transactions up to the `(i-1)`-th day minus the price of the stock on the `i`-th day. If we sell the stock on the `i`-th day, the profit is the profit we can achieve with `j-1` transactions up to the `(i-1)`-th day plus the price of the stock on the `i`-th day.

The base case is `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `j` because with no days, the profit is zero.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def max_profit(k, prices):
    n = len(prices)
    dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

CoT: To reverse the bits of a given 32-bit unsigned integer, we can use Python's built-in functions to convert the integer to its binary representation, reverse the binary digits, and then convert it back to an integer. Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Convert the given integer `n` to its binary representation using the `bin` function. The `bin` function returns a string that starts with '0b', so we need to slice off the first two characters to get the binary digits.
2. Reverse the binary digits using the `[::-1]` slicing method.
3. Convert the reversed binary string back to an integer using the `int` function, specifying the base as 2.

Here is the Python code to implement this:
Response: python
def reverse_bits(n):
    # Convert the integer to its binary representation
    binary_str = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # Reverse the binary digits
    reversed_binary_str = binary_str[::-1]
    
    # Convert the reversed binary string back to an integer
    reversed_int = int(reversed_binary_str, 2)
    
    return reversed_int

# Example usage
n = 0b00000010100101000001111010011100
reversed_n = reverse_bits(n)

*   In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 3**, the input represents the signed integer. `-3`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The input binary string **00000000000000000000000000001011** has a total of three '1' bits.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The input binary string **00000000000000000000000010000000** has a total of one '1' bit.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
**Output:** 31
**Explanation:** The input binary string **11111111111111111111111111111101** has a total of thirty one '1' bits.

**Constraints:**

*   The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`.

**Follow up:** If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of an unsigned integer, we can use a simple algorithm that iterates through each bit of the integer and counts the number of '1's. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Convert the integer to its binary representation**: Since the integer is given as a binary string of length 32, we can directly work with the binary string.

2. **Iterate through each bit**: We will loop through each character in the binary string from left to right.

3. **Count the '1's**: For each character in the binary string, if it is '1', we increment a counter.

4. **Return the count**: After iterating through all the bits, we return the counter value, which represents the number of '1' bits in the binary representation.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def count_ones(n):
    # Convert the integer to its binary representation as a string
    binary_str = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # Initialize a counter for the number of '1's
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each character in the binary string
    for bit in binary_str:
        # If the bit is '1', increment the counter
        if bit == '1':
            count += 1
    
    # Return the count of '1's
    return count

CoT: To transpose the content of a text file where each row has the same number of columns and each field is separated by a space, we can use Python's `numpy` library which provides a convenient way to handle such data. Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. **Read the file**: Use `numpy`'s ` genfromtext` function to read the file into a numpy array. This function can handle space-separated fields.

2. ** Transpose the array**: Use the `numpy` `T` method to transpose the array. This will swap the rows and columns.

3. **Convert the transposed array back to a string**: Use `numpy`'s ` torite` function to convert the transposed array back to a string.

Here is the Python code to achieve this:
Response: python
import numpy as np

# Read the file into a numpy array
data = np genfromtext('file.txt')

# Transpose the array
transposed_data = data.T

# Convert the transposed array back to a string
transposed_data_str = np genfromtext(transposed_data)

# Print the transposed data

Original Question: You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define `dp[i]` as the maximum amount of money we can robust from the first `i` houses without alerting the police.

The recurrence relation for `dp[i]` can be defined as follows:
- If we do not rob the `i`-th house, then the maximum amount of money we can robust from the first `i` houses is the same as the maximum amount of money we can robust from the first `i-1` houses, i.e., `dp[i] = dp[i-1]`.
- If we rob the `i`-th house, then we cannot rob the `(i-1)`-th house, so the maximum amount of money we can robust from the first `i` houses is the sum of the money in the `i`-th house and the maximum amount of money we can robust from the first `i-2` houses, i.e., `dp[i] = nums[i] + dp[i-2]`.

We need to consider the base cases:
- If `i = 0`, then `dp[0] = 0` (we have not robbed any houses).
- If `i = 1`, then `dp[1] = nums[1]` (we can rob the first house).

Using this recurrence relation, we can fill in the `dp` array from `i = 2` to `i = n` (where `n` is the length of the array `nums`). The final answer will be `dp[n]`.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def max_rob amount(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = nums[0]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], nums[i-1] + dp[i-2])
    return dp[n]

*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the right side view of a binary tree, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. The right side view of a binary tree is the set of nodes visible when looking from the right side, ordered from top to bottom. This means we need to process the tree level by level and keep the rightmost node from each level.

Here is the step-by-step Python code to solve the problem:

1. ** Initialize an empty list `result` to store the right side view.**
2. ** Check if the root is `None`. If it is, return an empty list.**
3. ** Create a queue `queue` and Enqueue the root.**
4. ** While the queue is not empty, perform the following steps:**
   - ** Initialize a variable `rightmost` to store the rightmost value of the current level.**
   - ** For each node in the current level (i.e., while the queue is not empty), Dequeue a node and add its value to `rightmost`.**
   - ** Enqueue the right child of the dequeued node, if it exists.**
   - ** Enqueue the left child of the dequeued node, if it exists.**
   - ** After processing all nodes in the current level, append `rightmost` to the `result` list.**
5. ** Return the `result` list.**

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of islands in a given `m x n` 2D binary grid, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.

CoT: To find the bitwise AND of all numbers in the range \([left, right]\), we can use the property of the bitwise AND operation. The bitwise AND of a range of numbers will be the same as the bitwise AND of the leftmost number in the range and the rightmost number in the range if the range is a power of two or can be broken down into such ranges.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. **Find the rightmost number with the same number of bits as `left` and `right`**: This can be done by performing a bitwise AND of `left` and `right` until `left` and `right` are equal. This will give us the rightmost number in the range that has the same number of bits as all the numbers in the range.

2. **Perform the bitwise AND of this rightmost number with `left`**: Since the rightmost number has the same number of bits as all the numbers in the range, performing a bitwise AND of this rightmost number with `left` will give us the bitwise AND of all the numbers in the range.

**Explanation:** There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 0
**Output:** 0

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= n <= 5 * 106`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of prime numbers strictly less than a given integer `n`, we can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. This algorithm is an efficient way to find all prime numbers up to any given limit.

Here is the step-by-step Python code to solve the problem:

1. Create a boolean array `is_prime` of size `n` and initialize all entries as `True`. This array will be used to mark the non-prime numbers.
2. Set `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` to `False` since 0 and 1 are not prime.
3. For each number `p` from 2 to the square root of `n`, if `is_prime[p]` is `True`, then it is a prime number. Mark all multiples of `p` as non-prime by setting `is_prime[p * p]`, `is_prime[p * (p + 1)]`, etc., to `False`.
4. Count the number of `True` values in the `is_prime` array from index 2 to `n-1`. This count will give us the number of prime numbers strictly less than `n`.

Here is the Python code implementing the above steps:
Response: python
def count_primes(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    
    is_prime = [True] * n
    is_prime[0] = False
    is_prime[1] = False
    
    p = 2
    while p * p < n:
        if is_prime[p]:
            for i in range(p * p, n, p):
                is_prime[i] = False
        p += 1
    
    return sum(is_prime[2:])

# Example usage
print(count_primes(10))  # Output: 4
print(count_primes(0))   # Output: 0
print(count_primes(1))   # Output: 0

Original Question: Given two strings `s` and `t`, _determine if they are isomorphic_.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "egg", t = "add"
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "foo", t = "bar"
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "paper", t = "title"
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
*   `t.length == s.length`
*   `s` and `t` consist of any valid ascii character.

*   `t.length == s.length`
*   `s` and `t` consist of any valid ascii character.
CoT: To determine if two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic, we need to check if there exists a bijection (one-to-one correspondence) between the characters of `s` and `t` that preserves the order of the characters. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. **Check the lengths of the strings**: If the lengths of `s` and `t` are not equal, they cannot be isomorphic. Return `False`.

2. **Create a mapping from `s` to `t`**: Iterate through the strings and map each character in `s` to the corresponding character in `t`. Use a dictionary to store this mapping.

3. **Check if the mapping is a bijection**: As we map each character, check if the same character in `t` has already been mapped to a different character in `s`. If it has, the mapping is not a bijection, and the strings are not isomorphic. Return `False`.

4. **Verify the order**: After mapping all characters, verify that the order of characters in `s` is preserved in `t` by checking if the values in the dictionary are in the same order as the keys.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def is_isomorphic(s, t):
    if len(s)!= len(t):
        return False

    mapping = {}

CoT: To reverse a given singly linked list, we can use an iterative approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: We need three pointers to keep track of the current node, the previous node, and the next node.
2. **Move Through the List**: Iterate through the list from the head to the tail.
3. ** change-pointers**: For each node, set the next pointer to the previous node, and move the previous and current pointers one step forward.
4. **Set New Head**: After the iteration, the previous node will be the new head of the reversed list.

*   All the pairs prerequisites\[i\] are **unique**.
CoT: To determine if it is possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites, we can use a topological sort algorithm. Topological sort is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed graph such that for every directed edge \(u \rightarrow v\), vertex \(u\) comes before vertex \(v\) in the ordering. If a topological sort exists, the graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and it is possible to finish all courses.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. ** Create a graph from the prerequisites:**
   - Initialize an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Initialize an array to keep track of the in-degrees (number of incoming edges) of each vertex.

2. ** build the graph and in-degrees:**
   - For each prerequisite pair \([ai, bi]\), add an edge from \(bi\) to \(ai\) in the adjacency list and increment the in-degree of \(ai\).

3. ** Find vertices with in-degree 0:**
   - These vertices have no prerequisites and can be taken first. Add them to a queue.

4. ** Perform topological sort:**
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Remove a vertex from the queue.
     - Add the vertex to the topological order.
     - For each neighbor of the removed vertex, decrease its in-degree by 1.
     - If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.

5. ** Check if all vertices are in the topological order:**
   - If the topological order contains all vertices, it is possible to finish all courses. Otherwise, it is not possible.

Here is the Python code implementing the above steps:
Response: python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def can_finish_courses(num_courses, prerequisites):
    # Create a graph and in-degrees
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    in_degrees = [0] * num_courses
    
    # build the graph and in-degrees
    for ai, bi in prerequisites:
        graph[bi].append(ai)
        in_degrees[ai] += 1
    
    # Find vertices with in-degree 0
    queue = deque([i for i in range(num_courses) if in_degrees[i] == 0])
    
    # Perform topological sort
    topological_order = []
    while queue:
        vertex = queue.popleft()
        topological_order.append(vertex)
        for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
            in_degrees[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degrees[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    # Check if all vertices are in the topological order
    return len(topological_order) == num_courses

# Example usage

Original Question: A [**trie**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) (pronounced as "try ") or **prefix tree** is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the Trie class:

*   `Trie()` Initializes the trie object.
*   `void insert(String word)` Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
*   `boolean search(String word)` Returns `true` if the string `word` is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and `false` otherwise.
*   `boolean startsWith(String prefix)` Returns `true` if there is a previously inserted string `word` that has the prefix `prefix`, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "Trie ",  "insert ",  "search ",  "search ",  "startsWith ",  "insert ",  "search "\]
\[\[\], \[ "apple "\], \[ "apple "\], \[ "app "\], \[ "app "\], \[ "app "\], \[ "app "\]\]

CoT: To implement the Trie class, we will use a dictionary (or a hash map) to store the children of each node. Each node will have a key for each possible character in the alphabet (in this case, the 26 lowercase English letters), and a value that is either another node (if the key exists) or ` null` (if the key does not exist). Additionally, each node will have a boolean flag `is_end` to indicate whether the node represents the end of a word.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to a given target, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize Pointers and Variables:**
   - Set two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the array.
   - Initialize a variable `min_length` to store the minimal length of the subarray. Set it to `0` initially.
   - Initialize a variable `current_sum` to store the sum of the elements in the current subarray. Set it to `0` initially.

2. **Iterate Through the Array:**
   - Use the `right` pointer to expand the subarray by adding elements to `current_sum`.
   - While `current_sum` is less than the target, move the `right` pointer to the right and add the new element to `current_sum`.
   - Once `current_sum` is greater than or equal to the target, update `min_length` with the length of the current subarray if it is smaller than the current `min_length`.
   - Move the `left` pointer to the right to reduce the size of the subarray and update `current_sum` by subtracting the element at the `left` pointer.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - After iterating through the array, return the `min_length`. If `min_length` is still `0`, it means no subarray meets the condition, so return `0`.

Here's the Python code implementing this algorithm:
Response: python
def minSubarrayLength(target, nums):
    left, right = 0, 0
    min_length = 0
    current_sum = 0

    while right < len(nums):
        current_sum += nums[right]
        while current_sum >= target:
            if min_length == 0 or right - left < min_length:
                min_length = right - left
            current_sum -= nums[left]
            left += 1
        right += 1

*   `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
*   `ai != bi`
*   All the pairs `[ai, bi]` are **distinct**.
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a topological sort algorithm. Topological sort is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed graph such that for every directed edge `u -> v`, vertex `u` comes before `v` in the ordering. This is exactly what we need to do here: order the courses such that each course `ai` comes after all its prerequisites `bi`.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. ** Create a graph from the prerequisites:**
   - Initialize an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Initialize a list to keep track of the in-degrees (the number of incoming edges) for each vertex.

2. ** build the graph and in-degrees:**
   - For each prerequisite pair `[ai, bi]`, add an edge from `bi` to `ai` in the adjacency list and increment the in-degree of `ai`.

3. ** Find all vertices with in-degree 0:**
   - These vertices have no prerequisites and can be taken first. Add them to a queue.

4. ** Perform the topological sort:**
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Remove a vertex from the queue.
     - Add this vertex to the result list.
     - For each neighbor of the removed vertex, decrease its in-degree by 1.
     - If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.

5. ** Check if all vertices have been processed:**
   - If the result list has the same length as the number of courses, then all vertices have been processed, and the result list is a valid topological order. Otherwise, it is impossible to finish all courses, and we return an empty list.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def topological_sort(num_courses, prerequisites):
    # Create a graph and in-degrees
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    in_degrees = [0] * num_courses
    
    # build the graph and in-degrees
    for ai, bi in prerequisites:
        graph[bi].append(ai)
        in_degrees[ai] += 1
    
    # Find all vertices with in-degree 0
    queue = deque([i for i in range(num_courses) if in_degrees[i] == 0])
    
    # Perform the topological sort
    result = []
    while queue:
        vertex = queue.popleft()
        result.append(vertex)
        for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
            in_degrees[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degrees[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    # Check if all vertices have been processed
    if len(result) == num_courses:
        return result
    else:
        return []

# Example usage
num_courses = 4
prerequisites = [[1, 0], [2, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]]
print(topological_sort(num_courses, prerequisites))

*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
*   `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
*   All the strings of `words` are unique.
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find all possible words on the board. We will iterate through each cell on the board and check if we can form a word starting from that cell by moving to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) and checking if the word formed is in the list of words.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the DFS function**: The DFS function will take the current position on the board, the current word being formed, and the board itself. It will recursively explore all possible paths from the current position and check if the word formed is in the list of words.

2. **Initialize the result list**: Create an empty list to store all the words found on the board.

3. **Iterate through each cell on the board**: For each cell, check if it is within the bounds of the board and if it has not been used in the current word. If it meets these conditions, add it to the current word and recursively call the DFS function with the new position and the updated word. If the word formed is in the list of words, add it to the result list.

4. **Return the result list**: After iterating through all the cells, return the result list containing all the words found on the board.

Here is the Python code implementing the above steps:

def find_words_on_board(board, words):

Original Question: You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,2\]

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to consider the circular arrangement of the houses. We can break the problem into two subproblems: robing houses from the first to the second-to-last house, and robing houses from the second to the last house. This way, we avoid robing two adjacent houses.

Let's define a function `dp(n)` that returns the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from houses `1` to `n` without alerting the police. We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.

The recurrence relation for `dp(n)` is:
\[ dp(n) = \max(dp(n-1), dp(n-2) + nums[n]) \]

However, since the houses are arranged in a circle, we need to consider two cases:
1. Robing houses from the first to the second-to-last house.
2. Robing houses from the second to the last house.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def max_robability(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Case 1: Robing houses from the first to the second-to-last house
    dp1 = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp1[1] = nums[0]
    for i in range(2, n):

        dp2[i] = max(dp2[i-1], dp2[i-2] + nums[i])
    
    # The maximum amount of money that can be robbed without alerting the police

CoT: To find the shortest palindrome that can be formed by adding characters in front of the given string `s`, we can use a method that involves finding the longest palindromic prefix of `s` and then adding the reverse of the remaining part of `s` to the front of `s`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Find the longest palindromic prefix:**
   - Start from the beginning of the string and check if the substring from the start to the current position is a palindrome.
   - Keep track of the length of the longest palindromic prefix found.

2. **Determine the remaining part of the string:**
   - Once we have the longest palindromic prefix, the remaining part of the string is the part that is not part of the palindromic prefix.

3. **Form the palindrome:**
   - To form the shortest palindrome, we add the reverse of the remaining part to the front of the original string.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python

CoT: To find the `kth` largest element in an integer array `nums` in `O(n)` time complexity, we can use the **median of medians** algorithm. This algorithm is a deterministic algorithm that can find the `kth` smallest element in an unsorted list in linear time. To find the `kth` largest element, we can simply find the `kth` smallest element in the negated array.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Negate the array**: Since we are looking for the `kth` largest element, we can negate all the elements in the array. This will convert the problem of finding the `kth` largest element to finding the `kth` smallest element in the negated array.

2. **Apply the median of medians algorithm**: Use the median of medians algorithm to find the `kth` smallest element in the negated array. The median of medians algorithm works as follows:
   - Divide the array into subarrays of size 5 (or as close to 5 as possible).
   - Find the median of each subarray.
   - Recursively find the median of the medians (this will be the median of the entire array).
   - Use the median as a pivot and partition the array around the pivot.
   - Determine which part of the partitioned array contains the `kth` smallest element.
   - Recursively apply the algorithm to the appropriate part of the partitioned array.

3. **Negate the result**: Once we have found the `kth` smallest element in the negated array, we need to negate it to get the `kth` largest element in the original array.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def find_kth_largest_element(nums, k):

*   `1 <= n <= 60`
Attacked Question: Find all valid combinations of `k` numbers that sum up to `n` such that the following conditions are true:

*   Only numbers `1` through `9` are used.
*   Each number is used **at most once**.

Return _a list of all possible valid combinations_. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 3, n = 7
**Output:** \[\[1,2,4\]\]
**Explanation:**
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
There are no other valid combinations.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** k = 3, n = 9
**Output:** \[\[1,2,6\],\[1,3,5\],\[2,3,4\]\]
**Explanation:**
1 + 2 + 6 = 9
1 + 3 + 5 = 9
2 + 3 + 4 = 9
There are no other valid combinations.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** k = 4, n = 1
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** There are no valid combinations.
Using 4 different numbers in the range \[1,9\], the smallest sum we can get is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and since 10 > 1, there are no valid combination.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= k <= 9`
*   `1 <= n <= 60`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach. We will start with an empty combination and add numbers from 1 to 9 one by one, ensuring that we do not use any number more than once and that the sum of the current combination does not exceed `n`. If the sum of the current combination equals `n` and we have used exactly `k` numbers, we add the combination to the result list. If the sum exceeds `n` or we have used more than `k` numbers, we backtrack and try the next number.

Here is the Python code to implement this approach:
Response: python
def find_combinations(k, n, start, current_combination, result):
    if len(current_combination) == k and sum(current_combination) == n:
        result.append(current_combination[:])
        return
    if len(current_combination) >= k or sum(current_combination) > n:
        return
    
    for i in range(start, 10):
        current_combination.append(i)
        find_combinations(k, n, i + 1, current_combination, result)
        current_combination.pop()

def solve(k, n):
    result = []
    find_combinations(k, n, 1, [], result)
    return result

# Example usage
print(solve(3, 7))  # Output: [[1, 2, 4]]
print(solve(3, 9))  # Output: [[1, 2, 6], [1, 3, 5], [2, 3, 4]]

CoT: To determine if any value appears at least twice in the given integer array `nums`, we can use a set to keep track of the unique elements we have seen so far. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize an empty set `unique_elements`.
2. Iterate through each element `num` in the array `nums`.
3. If `num` is already in the set `unique_elements`, it means we have seen it before, so return `true`.
4. If `num` is not in the set `unique_elements`, add it to the set.
5. If we have iterated through the entire array without finding any duplicates, return `false`.

Original Question: A city's **skyline** is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return _the **skyline** formed by these buildings collectively_.

The geometric information of each building is given in the array `buildings` where `buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]`:

*   `lefti` is the x coordinate of the left edge of the `ith` building.
*   `righti` is the x coordinate of the right edge of the `ith` building.
*   `heighti` is the height of the `ith` building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`.

The **skyline** should be represented as a list of "key points " **sorted by their x-coordinate** in the form `[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

**Note:** There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** buildings = \[\[2,9,10\],\[3,7,15\],\[5,12,12\],\[15,20,10\],\[19,24,8\]\]
**Output:** \[\[2,10\],\[3,15\],\[7,12\],\[12,0\],\[15,10\],\[20,8\],\[24,0\]\]
**Explanation:**
Figure A shows the buildings of the input.
Figure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in figure B represent the key points in the output list.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** buildings = \[\[0,2,3\],\[2,5,3\]\]
**Output:** \[\[0,3\],\[5,0\]\]

*   `1 <= buildings.length <= 104`
*   `0 <= lefti < righti <= 231 - 1`
*   `1 <= heighti <= 231 - 1`

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the skyline formed by a set of buildings, we can use a divide-and-conquer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Divide the buildings into two halves**: recursively find the skyline for the left half and the right half.
2. ** merge the two skylines**: combine the skylines from the left and right halves into a single skyline.

Let's break down the steps in more detail:

### Step 1: Divide the buildings into two halves
We can use a recursive function to divide the buildings into two halves. If the list of buildings has only one building, we return a list containing that building's key points. Otherwise, we find the middle index of the list and divide the list into two sublists.

### Step 2: Merge the two skylines
To merge the two skylines, we need to combine the key points from both skylines while ensuring that there are no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height. We can do this by iterating through the key points of both skylines and comparing their heights.

Here's the Python code to implement this algorithm:
Response: python
def find_skyline(buildings):
    if len(buildings) == 1:
        return [[ buildings[0][0], buildings[0][2]], [ buildings[0][1], 0]]
    
    mid = len(buildings) // 2
    left_skyline = find_skyline(buildings[:mid])
    right_skyline = find_skyline(buildings[mid:])
    
    return merge_skylines(left_skyline, right_skyline)

def merge_skylines(left_skyline, right_skyline):
    result = []
    i = 0
    j = 0
    
    while i < len(left_skyline) and j < len(right_skyline):
        if left_skyline[i][1] < right_skyline[j][1]:
            result.append(left_skyline[i])
            i += 1
        elif left_skyline[i][1] > right_skyline[j][1]:
            result.append(right_skyline[j])
            j += 1
        else:
            if i == 0 or left_skyline[i][0]!= left_skyline[i-1][0]:
                result.append([left_skyline[i][0], left_skyline[i][1]])
            if j == 0 or right_skyline[j][0]!= right_skyline[j-1][0]:
                result.append([right_skyline[j][0], right_skyline[j][1]])
            i += 1
            j += 1
    
    while i < len(left_skyline):
        result.append(left_skyline[i])
        i += 1
    
    while j < len(right_skyline):
        result.append(right_skyline[j])
        j += 1
    
    if result[-1][1] == 0:
        result.pop()
    
    return result

Original Question: You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `indexDiff` and `valueDiff`.

Find a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that:

*   `abs(i - j) <= indexDiff`.
*   `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valueDiff`, and

Return `true` _if such pair exists or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\], indexDiff = 3, valueDiff = 0
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** We can choose (i, j) = (0, 3).
We satisfy the three conditions:
i != j --> 0 != 3
abs(i - j) <= indexDiff --> abs(0 - 3) <= 3
abs(nums\[i\] - nums\[j\]) <= valueDiff --> abs(1 - 1) <= 0

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a combination of a hash map and a sliding window approach. The idea is to keep track of the last positions of each number in the array as we iterate through it. For each number, we check if there is a previous number that satisfies the conditions `abs(i - j) <= indexDiff` and `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valueDiff`.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Create a hash map to store the last position of each number in the array.
2. Iterate through the array from left to right.
3. For each number, check if there is a previous number that is within `indexDiff` distance and has a value within `valueDiff` distance.
4. If such a number exists, return `true`.
5. If no such number exists, update the last position of the current number in the hash map.
6. If the end of the array is reached without finding a valid pair, return `false`.

CoT: To find the largest square containing only `1`'s in a given `m x n` binary matrix, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define a new matrix `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the side length of the largest square with its bottom-right corner at `(i, j)`.

The recurrence relation for `dp[i][j]` can be defined as follows:
- If `matrix[i][j] == 0`, then `dp[i][j] = 0` because a square cannot exist at this position.
- If `matrix[i][j] == 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is the minimum of the four adjacent cells (top, left, top-left, and left-top) plus 1. This is because the side length of the square at `(i, j)` is limited by the smallest side length of the squares at its adjacent positions.

We will iterate through the matrix and update the `dp` matrix accordingly. The maximum value in the `dp` matrix will give us the side length of the largest square containing only `1`'s. The area of this square will be the square of this maximum value.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:
Response: python
def largest_square(matrix):
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3,4,5,6\]
**Output:** 6

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[\]
**Output:** 0

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = \[1\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5 * 104]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 104`
*   The tree is guaranteed to be **complete**.
CoT: To determine the number of nodes in a complete binary tree given its root, we can use the property that a complete binary tree with height \( h \) has between \( 2^h \) and \( 2^{h+1} - 1 \) nodes. We can find the height of the tree by counting the number of edges from the root to the farthest leaf node.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. **Find the height of the tree:**
   - Start from the root and move down to the farthest leaf node, counting the number of edges.
   - This can be done using a depth-first search (DFS) or a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.

2. **Calculate the number of nodes:**
   - Once we have the height \( h \), we can determine the number of nodes in the tree.
   - If the tree is a perfect binary tree (i.e., all levels are completely filled), it has \( 2^{h+1} - 1 \) nodes.
   - If the tree is not a perfect binary tree, it has between \( 2^h \) and \( 2^{h+1} - 1 \) nodes. We can find the exact number of nodes by counting the number of nodes in the last level.

Here is the Python code to implement this algorithm:
Response: python
def count_nodes(root):
    if root is None:
        return 0

    height = 0
    current = root
    while current:
        current = current left
        height += 1

    # Count the number of nodes in the last level
    last_level_count = 0
    current = root
    while current:
        if current right:
            last_level_count += 1
        current = current left

    # Calculate the total number of nodes
    if last_level_count == 0:
        return 2 ** height - 1
    else:
        return 2 ** height + last_level_count - 1

CoT: To find the total area covered by the two rectangles, we need to calculate the area of each rectangle and then subtract the area of their intersection if they overlap. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Calculate the area of the first rectangle.

Original Question: Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (`push`, `top`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyStack` class:

*   `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
*   `int pop()` Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
*   `int top()` Returns the element on the top of the stack.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the stack is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

*   You must use **only** standard operations of a queue, which means that only `push to back`, `peek/pop from front`, `size` and `is empty` operations are valid.
*   Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "MyStack ",  "push ",  "push ",  "top ",  "pop ",  "empty "\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 2, 2, false\]

**Explanation**
MyStack myStack = new MyStack();
myStack.push(1);
myStack.push(2);
myStack.top(); // return 2
myStack.pop(); // return 2
myStack.empty(); // return False

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= x <= 9`
*   At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `empty`.
*   All the calls to `pop` and `top` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the stack using only one queue?
CoT: To implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues, we can use the following approach:

1. ** push(x) **: To push an element `x` onto the stack, we add it to the back of the first queue.
2. ** top() **: To get the top element of the stack, we need to move all elements from the first queue to the second queue except the last one. The last element in the second queue will be the top element of the stack.
3. ** pop() **: To remove the top element from the stack, we move all elements from the second queue to the first queue except the last one. The last element in the first queue will be the top element, which we then remove.
4. ** empty() **: To check if the stack is empty, we check if both queues are empty.

Here is the Python code for the implementation:
Response: python
from collections import deque

class My_stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self queue1 = deque()
        self queue2 = deque()

**Output:** \[ "0 ", "2->4 ", "6 ", "8->9 "\]
**Explanation:** The ranges are:
\[0,0\] -->  "0 "
\[2,4\] -->  "2->4 "
\[6,6\] -->  "6 "
\[8,9\] -->  "8->9 "

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= nums.length <= 20`
*   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
*   All the values of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is sorted in ascending order.
Attacked Question: You are given a **sorted unique** integer array `nums`.

A **range** `[a,b]` is the set of all integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive).

Return _the **smallest sorted** list of ranges that **cover all the numbers in the array exactly**_. That is, each element of `nums` is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer `x` such that `x` is in one of the ranges but not in `nums`.

Each range `[a,b]` in the list should be output as:

*   `"a->b "` if `a != b`
*   `"a "` if `a == b`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,2,4,5,7\]
**Output:** \[ "0->2 ", "4->5 ", "7 "\]
**Explanation:** The ranges are:
\[0,2\] -->  "0->2 "
\[4,5\] -->  "4->5 "
\[7,7\] -->  "7 "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,2,3,4,6,8,9\]
**Output:** \[ "0 ", "2->4 ", "6 ", "8->9 "\]
**Explanation:** The ranges are:
\[0,0\] -->  "0 "
\[2,4\] -->  "2->4 "
\[6,6\] -->  "6 "
\[8,9\] -->  "8->9 "

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= nums.length <= 20`
*   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
*   All the values of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is sorted in ascending order.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in a given sorted unique integer array `nums`, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the ranges.
2. Iterate through the array and keep track of the current range.
3. If the current element is the same as the next element, add the current element to the range.
4. If the current element is different from the next element, add the current range to the list and start a new range with the next element.
5. After iterating through the entire array, add the last range to the list.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def findRanges(nums):
    ranges = []
    start = None
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if start is None:
            start = nums[i]

                ranges.append(f"{start}-{nums[i-1]}")
            start = nums[i]

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all elements in an integer array that appear more than ` floor(n/3) ` times, we can use the Boyer-Moore algorithm with a slight modification to handle multiple majority elements. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize Variables:**

**Follow up:** If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?
CoT: To find the \( k \)-th smallest value in a binary search tree (BST), we can use an in-order traversal approach. In an in-order traversal, the values of the nodes are visited in ascending order. We can use a stack to keep track of the nodes we have visited so far and count them until we reach the \( k \)-th node.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Start with the root node and perform a left-to-right in-order traversal.
3. For each node, push it onto the stack.
4. If the stack size is equal to \( k \), the top of the stack is the \( k \)-th smallest value.
5. If the stack size is greater than \( k \), pop the stack until the stack size is equal to \( k \).

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
def kth_smallest(root, k):
    stack = []
    count = 0
    while root or stack:
        while root:

**Constraints:**

*   `-231 <= n <= 231 - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without loops/recursion?
CoT: To determine if an integer `n` is a power of two, we can use the property that a power of two has exactly one bit set to 1 in its binary representation. For example, the binary representation of 8 is 1000, which has only one bit set to 1. Similarly, the binary representation of 16 is 10000, which also has only one bit set to 1.

We can use the bitwise AND operation to check if a number has exactly one bit set to 1. If we perform a bitwise AND operation between `n` and `n-1`, the result will be 0 if `n` is a power of two. This is because subtracting 1 from a power of two will set all the bits to the right of the single set bit to 1, and the set bit itself to 0. When we perform a bitwise AND operation between a number with a single set bit and a number with all bits to the right of the set bit set to 1, the result will be 0.

Original Question: Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyQueue` class:

*   `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
*   `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
*   `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

*   You must use **only** standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
*   Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "MyQueue ",  "push ",  "push ",  "peek ",  "pop ",  "empty "\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 1, 1, false\]

**Explanation**
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: \[1\]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: \[1, 2\] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is \[2\]
myQueue.empty(); // return false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= x <= 9`
*   At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`.
*   All the calls to `pop` and `peek` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the queue such that each operation is **[amortized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis)** `O(1)` time complexity? In other words, performing `n` operations will take overall `O(n)` time even if one of those operations may take longer.

CoT: To implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks, we can use one stack to represent the front of the queue and another stack to represent the back of the queue. Here's how we can do it:

1. **Push**: To push an element `x` to the back of the queue, we simply push `x` onto the back stack.
2. **Pop**: To pop an element from the front of the queue, we need to check if the front stack is empty. If it is empty, we need to move all elements from the back stack to the front stack. Then, we pop the top element from the front stack.
3. **Peek**: To peek at the element at the front of the queue, we check if the front stack is empty. If it is empty, we need to move all elements from the back stack to the front stack. Then, we return the top element from the front stack.
4. **Empty**: To check if the queue is empty, we check if both the front stack and the back stack are empty.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= n <= 109`
CoT: To count the total number of digit `1` appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to `n`, we can use a systematic approach by considering each digit place (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) separately.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. **Determine the number of digits in `n`**: This will help us know how many digit places we need to consider.
2. **Iterate through each digit place**: Starting from the units place, move to the tens place, then the hundreds place, and so on.
3. **Count the number of `1`s in each digit place**:
   - For each digit place, calculate how many times `1` appears in that place for numbers up to `n`.
   - This can be done by considering the higher digits (left of the current place) and the current digit itself.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
def count_digit_one(n):
    # Convert n to a string to easily access individual digits
    n_str = str(n)
    digit_count = 0
    num_digits = len(n_str)

    # Iterate through each digit place

        # Calculate the number of times `1` appears in the current digit place
        higher_digits = int(n_str[:num_digits-i-1]) if num_digits > i else 0

            # If the current digit is not `1`, add the number of higher digits

*   `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
*   All `Node.val` are **unique**.
*   `p != q`
*   `p` and `q` will exist in the BST.
CoT: To find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in a binary search tree (BST), we can use the properties of a binary search tree. In a binary search tree, for any node, all nodes in its left子tree are less than the node, and all nodes in its right子tree are greater than the node. This property allows us to use a recursive approach to find the LCA.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. **Start from the root node.**
2. **If the root node is either `p` or `q`, then the root is the LCA.**
3. **If the value of the root node is greater than both `p` and `q`, then the LCA must be in the left子tree.**
4. **If the value of the root node is less than both `p` and `q`, then the LCA must be in the right子tree.**
5. **If the value of the root node is between `p` and `q` (or equal to either `p` or `q`), then the root is the LCA.**

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
class binary search tree {
    class Node {
        int val;
        binary search tree left;
        binary search tree right;
        Sarah(int val) { this(val, null, null); }
        binary search tree(int val, binary search tree left, binary search tree right) { this(val, left, right); }
    }
    public binary search tree root;
    public int findLCA binary search tree root, int p, int q) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        if (root == p || root == q) return root;
        if (p < root val且q < root val) return findLCA(root left, p, q);
        if (p > root val且q > root val) return findLCA(root right, p, q);
        return root;
    }

Original Question: Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**)."

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4\], p = 5, q = 1
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4\], p = 5, q = 4
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2\], p = 1, q = 2
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
*   `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
*   All `Node.val` are **unique**.
*   `p != q`
*   `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.

CoT: To find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in a binary tree, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to start from the root and check if both nodes are in the left or right subtree. If they are in different subtrees, then the root is the LCA. If they are in the same subtree, we recursively search for the LCA in that subtree.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:
Response: python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self val = x
        self left = None
        self right = None

def find_LCA(root, p, q):
    if root is None:
        return None
    if root == p or root == q:
        return root
    left_LCA = find_LCA(root left, p, q)
    right_LCA = find_LCA(root right, p, q)
    if left_LCA is None and right_LCA is None:
        return None
    return root

# Example usage
root = [3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 0, 8, None, None, 7, 4]
p = 5
q = 1
lca = find_LCA(root, p, q)
print(lca val)  # Output: 3

Original Question: There is a singly-linked list `head` and we want to delete a node `node` in it.

You are given the node to be deleted `node`. You will **not be given access** to the first node of `head`.

All the values of the linked list are **unique**, and it is guaranteed that the given node `node` is not the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

*   The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
*   The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
*   All the values before `node` should be in the same order.
*   All the values after `node` should be in the same order.

**Custom testing:**

*   For the input, you should provide the entire linked list `head` and the node to be given `node`. `node` should not be the last node of the list and should be an actual node in the list.
*   We will build the linked list and pass the node to your function.
*   The output will be the entire list after calling your function.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[4,5,1,9\], node = 5
**Output:** \[4,1,9\]
**Explanation:** You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the product of all elements in an array except the element at each position in linear time and without using division, we can use a two pass approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **First Pass: Calculate the prefix product**
   - Initialize a variable `prefix_product` to 1.
   - Iterate through the array from left to right.
   - For each element, multiply the current `prefix_product` by the element and store the result in a new array ` prefix_products` at the current index.
   - This array ` prefix_products` will store the product of all elements to the left of each element in the original array.

2. **Second Pass: Calculate the suffix product**
   - Initialize a variable ` suffix_product` to 1.
   - Iterate through the array from right to left.
   - For each element, multiply the current ` suffix_product` by the element and store the result in a new array ` suffix_products` at the current index.
   - This array ` suffix_products` will store the product of all elements to the right of each element in the original array.

3. **Combine the prefix and suffix products**
   - Iterate through the original array.
   - For each element, multiply the corresponding ` prefix_product` and ` suffix_product` and store the result in the original array at the current index.
   - This will give us the product of all elements except the element at the current position.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def product除 element(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    prefix_products = [1] * n
    suffix_products = [1] * n
    answer = [1] * n

    # First pass: Calculate the prefix product
    prefix_product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_products[i] = prefix_product * nums[i]

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the maximum element in a sliding window of size \( k \) in an array \( \text{nums} \), we can use a double-ended queue (DEQ) to keep track of the maximum element in the current window. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize the DEQ**: Start with an empty DEQ.
2. ** process each element in the array**:
   - **Add the current element to the DEQ**: Ensure that the DEQ is always in non-increasing order. This means that the front of the DEQ will always contain the maximum element in the current window.
   - **Remove elements from the front of the DEQ if they are outside the current window**: If the front of the DEQ is outside the current window (i.e., the index of the front element is less than \( i - k + 1 \)), remove it from the DEQ.
   - **Remove elements from the back of the DEQ if they are smaller than the current element**: If the current element is greater than the element at the back of the DEQ, remove the element at the back of the DEQ. This ensures that the DEQ is always in non-increasing order.
   - **Add the current element to the back of the DEQ**: Add the current element to the back of the DEQ.
3. ** extract the maximum element from the DEQ**: The front of the DEQ will always contain the maximum element in the current window. Add this element to the result list.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding a value `target` in an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix` where each row and each column is sorted in ascending order, we can use a binary search approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Convert the matrix into a single sorted list**: Since the matrix is sorted both row-wise and column-wise, we can convert it into a single sorted list by performing a diagonal traversal. This means we start from the top-left corner and move diagonally down to the right, then move up to the left, and so on.

2. **Perform binary search on the sorted list**: Once we have the sorted list, we can use binary search to find the `target` value. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

Here's the Python code to implement this algorithm:

def find_target(matrix, target):
    m = len(matrix)

    # Convert the matrix into a single sorted list

            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1
    
    # Perform binary search on the sorted list
    left, right = 0, len(sorted_list) - 1

        mid = (left + right) // 2

Attacked Question: Given a string `expression` of numbers and operators, return _all possible results from computing all the different possible ways to group numbers and operators_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

The test cases are generated such that the output values fit in a 32-bit integer and the number of different results does not exceed `104`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** expression =  "2-1-1 "
**Output:** \[0,2\]
**Explanation:**
((2-1)-1) = 0 
(2-(1-1)) = 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** expression =  "2\*3-4\*5 "
**Output:** \[-34,-14,-10,-10,10\]
**Explanation:**
(2\*(3-(4\*5))) = -34 
((2\*3)-(4\*5)) = -14 
((2\*(3-4))\*5) = -10 
(2\*((3-4)\*5)) = -10

*   `expression` consists of digits and the operator `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'*'`.
*   All the integer values in the input expression are in the range `[0, 99]`.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding all possible results from computing all different ways to group numbers and operators in a given string `expression`, we can use a recursive approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Define the recursive function**: We need a function that takes a string `s` and returns a list of all possible results from computing all different ways to group numbers and operators in `s`.

2. **Base case**: If the string `s` is empty, return an empty list.

3. **Identify the operators**: Iterate through the string `s` to find all the operators. For each operator, split the string into two parts: the part before the operator and the part after the operator.

4. **Recursive calls**: For each operator, recursively call the function on the two parts and combine the results using the operator.

5. **Combine the results**: For each pair of results from the two parts, apply the operator and add the result to the list of results for the entire string.

6. **Return the final list**: After processing all the operators, return the list of all possible results.

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def all possible results(s):
    if not s:
        return []
    
    results = []
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if s[i] in ['+', '-', '*']:
            left = all possible results(s[:i])
            right = all possible results(s[i+1:])
            for l in left:
                for r in right:
                    if s[i] == '+':
                        results.append(l + r)
                    elif s[i] == '-':
                        results.append(l - r)
                    elif s[i] == '*':
                        results.append(l * r)
    return results

Original Question: Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if_ `t` _is an anagram of_ `s`_, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "rat", t = "car"
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104`
*   `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

CoT: To determine if two strings `s` and `t` are anagrams, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If they are not, they cannot be anagrams.
2. Count the frequency of each character in both strings.
3. Compare the frequency counts of the characters in both strings. If they are the same for all characters, then the strings are anagrams.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the shortest distance between two different strings in an array, we can use a combination of a hash map and a minimum distance variable. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize the Data Structure:**
   - Create a hash map where the keys are the strings from the array, and the values are their indices.
   - Initialize a variable `minDistance` to a large number (e.g., `Integer.MAX_VALUE`).

2. ** Process Each Query:**
   - For each query with words `word1` and `word2`, check if both words are in the hash map.
   - If both words are in the hash map, calculate the distance between their indices.
   - Update the `minDistance` if the calculated distance is smaller.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - After processing all queries, return the `minDistance`.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:

import java.util \*;

class WordDistance {
    // Hash map to store the indices of the strings
    int[] indices;
    // Minimum distance variable

CoT: To find the shortest distance between the occurrence of two words in an array, we can use a two-pointer approach. We will iterate through the array and keep track of the last positions where `word1` and `word2` were found. The distance between these two positions will be the shortest distance between the two words.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize two variables `last_word1` and `last_word2` to -1. These variables will store the last positions of `word1` and `word2` respectively.
2. Iterate through the array `wordsDict`.
3. For each word in the array, check if it is equal to `word1` or `word2`.
4. If the word is equal to `word1`, update `last_word1` to the current index.
5. If the word is equal to `word2`, update `last_word2` to the current index.
6. After updating `last_word1` or `last_word2`, calculate the distance between `last_word1` and `last_word2` as `abs(last_word1 - last_word2)`.
7. Keep track of the minimum distance found so far.

*   `num` consists of only digits.
*   `num` does not contain any leading zeros except for zero itself.
CoT: To determine if a given number represented as a string is a strobogrammic number, we need to check if it looks the same when rotated 180 degrees. This means that each digit in the string must have a corresponding digit that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees. The digits that satisfy this condition are 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9. Specifically:
- 0 rotated 180 degrees is 0.
- 1 rotated 180 degrees is 1.
- 6 rotated 180 degrees is 9.
- 8 rotated 180 degrees is 8.
- 9 rotated 180 degrees is 6.

We can solve this problem by comparing each digit in the string with its corresponding digit when rotated 180 degrees. We start from the beginning and the end of the string and move towards the center. If the digits at these positions do not satisfy the condition, we return false. If we reach the center without finding any mismatch, we return true.

Response: python
def is_strobogrammic(num):

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** \["0","1","8"\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 14`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding all strobogrammatic numbers of length `n`, we need to consider the digits that look the same when rotated 180 degrees. These digits are `0`, `1`, `8`, `6`, and `9`. Specifically, `6` and `9` swap places when rotated.

We can use a recursive approach to generate all strobogrammatic numbers of length `n`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Base Case**: If `n` is 1, the strobogrammic numbers are simply the digits `0`, `1`, and `8`.
2. **Recursive Case**: If `n` is greater than 1, we can build the strobogrammic numbers by considering the first and last digits. The first digit can be `1`, `6`, `8`, or `9` (it cannot be `0` because it would make the number shorter than `n` when rotated). The last digit must be the corresponding digit that swaps with the first digit when rotated. For example, if the first digit is `6`, the last digit must be `9`. The remaining digits in the middle can be any strobogrammic number of length `n-2`.

Let's implement this approach in Python:
Response: python
def strobogrammatic_numbers(n):
    if n == 1:
        return ["0", "1", "8"]
    if n == 2:

*   `low` and `high` consist of only digits.
*   `low <= high`

Attacked Question: Given two strings low and high that represent two integers `low` and `high` where `low <= high`, return _the number of **strobogrammatic numbers** in the range_ `[low, high]`.

A **strobogrammatic number** is a number that looks the same when rotated `180` degrees (looked at upside down).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** low = "50", high = "100"
**Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** low = "0", high = "0"
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= low.length, high.length <= 15`
*   `low` and `high` consist of only digits.
*   `low <= high`
*   `low` and `high` do not contain any leading zeros except for zero itself.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of strobogrammic numbers in the range \([low, high]\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify Strobogrammic Digits:**
   - The digits that look the same when rotated 180 degrees are: 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9.
   - Specifically:
     - 0 becomes 0
     - 1 becomes 1
     - 6 becomes 9
     - 8 becomes 8
     - 9 becomes 6

2. **Generate Strobogrammic Numbers:**
   - We need to generate all possible strobogrammic numbers within the range \([low, high]\).
   - We can use a recursive approach to generate these numbers.

3. **Check Validity:**
   - For each generated number, check if it falls within the range \([low, high]\).

4. **Count Strobogrammic Numbers:**
   - Keep a count of all valid strobogrammic numbers.

Let's implement this step-by-step in Python:
Response: python
def is_strobogrammic(num):
    strobogrammic_map = {'0': '0', '1': '1', '6': '9', '8': '8', '9': '6'}
    num_str = str(num)
    return num_str == ''.join(strobogrammic_map[digit] for digit in reversed(num_str))

def generate_strobogrammic_numbers(length):
    if length == 0:
        return []
    if length == 1:
        return ['0', '1', '8']
    
    smaller_strobogrammic_numbers = generate_strobogrammic_numbers(length - 1)
    strobogrammic_numbers = []
    
    for num in smaller_strobogrammic_numbers:
        if num[-1] in ['0', '1', '8']:
            strobogrammic_numbers.append(num + num[-1])
        if num[-1] in ['6', '9']:
            strobogrammic_numbers.append(num + strobogrammic_map[num[-1]])
    
    return strobogrammic_numbers

def count_strobogrammic_numbers(low, high):
    strobogrammic_numbers = []
    for length in range(len(str(low)), len(str(high)) + 1):
        strobogrammic_numbers.extend(generate_strobogrammic_numbers(length))
    
    count = 0
    for num in strobogrammic_numbers:
        if low <= int(num) <= high:
            count += 1
    
    return count

# Example usage
low = "50"
high = "100"

Original Question: We can shift a string by shifting each of its letters to its successive letter.

*   For example, `"abc "` can be shifted to be `"bcd "`.

We can keep shifting the string to form a sequence.

*   For example, we can keep shifting `"abc "` to form the sequence: `"abc " -> "bcd " -> ... -> "xyz "`.

Given an array of strings `strings`, group all `strings[i]` that belong to the same shifting sequence. You may return the answer in **any order**.

*   `strings[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
CoT: To solve the problem of grouping strings that belong to the same shifting sequence, we can use a function to determine the shift pattern of each string. We will then group the strings based on these patterns.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define a function to calculate the shift pattern of a string:**
   - Initialize an array `shifts` of size 26 (for the 26 letters of the English alphabet) with all elements set to 0.
   - Iterate through each character in the string.
   - For each character, calculate its position in the alphabet ( subtract 'a' from the character's ASCII value).
   - Update the `shifts` array by incrementing the value at the position of the current character by 1.
   - Return the `shifts` array.

2. **Group the strings based on their shift patterns:**
   - Create a dictionary to store the shift patterns as keys and the strings as values.
   - Iterate through each string in the `strings` array.
   - Calculate the shift pattern of the current string using the function defined above.
   - If the shift pattern is already a key in the dictionary, add the current string to the corresponding value list.
   - If the shift pattern is not a key in the dictionary, create a new key with the shift pattern and add the current string to the value list.

3. **Return the grouped strings:**
   - Convert the values of the dictionary to a list of lists and return it.

Here is the Python code implementing the above solution:
Response: python
def calculate_shifts(s):
    shifts = [0] * 26
    for char in s:
        shifts[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
    return shifts

def group_strings_by_shift(s):
    shift_dict = {}
    for s in s:
        shifts = calculate_shifts(s)
        if tuple(shifts) in shift_dict:
            shift_dict[tuple(shifts)].append(s)
        else:
            shift_dict[tuple(shifts)] = [s]
    return list(shift_dict.values())

# Example usage
strings = ["abc", "bcd", "acef", "xyz", "az", "ba", "a", "z"]

*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of uni-value subtrees in a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will define a recursive function that checks if a given subtree is uni-value and counts the number of uni-value subtrees in it.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Base Case**: If the root is `None`, it means we have reached a leaf node or an empty tree. In this case, we return 0 because there are no subtrees to consider.

2. **Recursive Case**: If the root is not `None`, we need to check if the left and right subtrees are uni-value and if the root value is the same as the values in its subtrees. If all these conditions are satisfied, we return 1 (for the current subtree) plus the number of uni-value subtrees in the left and right subtrees. Otherwise, we return the number of uni-value subtrees in the left and right subtrees.

Let's implement this approach in Python:
Response: python
def count_uni_value_subtrees(root):
    if root is None:
        return 0
    
    # Check if the left and right subtrees are uni-value and if the root value is the same as the values in its subtrees

Implement the `Vector2D` class:

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= intervals.length <= 104`
*   `0 <= starti < endi <= 106`
CoT: To determine the minimum number of conference rooms required, we can use a greedy algorithm. The idea is to keep track of the number of rooms currently in use and the end times of the meetings. We will iterate through the intervals, and for each interval, we will check if a room is available by comparing the start time of the current interval with the end times of the meetings already in use. If a room is available, we can free it up for the current meeting. If not, we will need to add a new room.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Sort the intervals based on their start times.
2. Initialize a variable `rooms` to 0, which represents the number of rooms currently in use.
3. Initialize a list `end_times` to store the end times of the meetings currently in use.
4. Iterate through the sorted intervals.
5. For each interval, check if there is a room available by finding the first meeting in `end_times` that ends before or at the start time of the current interval.
6. If a room is available, free it up by removing the end time of the meeting from `end_times` and increment `rooms` by 1.
7. If no room is available, add the end time of the current interval to `end_times` and increment `rooms` by 1.
8. After iterating through all intervals, the value of `rooms` will be the minimum number of conference rooms required.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
def min conference_rooms(intervals):
    intervals.sort()
    rooms = 0
    end_times = []
    
    for interval in intervals:
        start, end = interval
        available = False
        
        for end_time in end_times:
            if end_time <= start:
                available = True
                end_times.remove(end_time)
                rooms += 1
                break
        
        if not available:
            end_times.append(end)
            rooms += 1
    
    return rooms

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all possible combinations of factors of a given integer \( n \), we can use a recursive approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Base Case**: If \( n \) is 1, there are no factors in the range \([2, n-1]\), so we return an empty list.
2. **Recursive Case**: If \( n \) is greater than 1, we start by finding the smallest factor of \( n \) (which is 2). We then recursively find all factor combinations of \( n \) divided by this factor. We also need to consider the factor itself in the combinations.
3. **Combining Results**: We combine the factor with each combination of factors of \( n \) divided by the factor. We then return all these combinations.

CoT: To determine if a given array is a correct preorder traversal sequence of a binary search tree (BST), we need to ensure that the sequence follows the properties of a binary search tree. Specifically, for a binary search tree:

1. The left子 tree of any node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value.
2. The right子 tree of any node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.
3. Both the left and right子 trees are binary search trees.

Given the preorder sequence, we can use a stack to keep track of the expected range of values for each node. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a stack and a variable `min_val` to negative infinity.
2. Iterate through the preorder sequence.

Original Question: There is a row of `n` houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x 3` cost matrix `costs`.

*   For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with the color red; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...

Return _the minimum cost to paint all houses_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** costs = \[\[17,2,17\],\[16,16,5\],\[14,3,19\]\]
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** costs = \[\[7,6,2\]\]

*   `costs.length == n`
*   `costs[i].length == 3`
*   `1 <= n <= 100`
*   `1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20`

*   `costs[i].length == 3`
*   `1 <= n <= 100`
*   `1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to paint the first `i` houses such that the `i`-th house is painted with color `j`.

The base case is when `i = 0`. For each color, the cost to paint the first house is simply the cost of that color:
\[ dp[0][0] = costs[0][0] \]
\[ dp[0][1] = costs[0][1] \]
\[ dp[0][2] = costs[0][2] \]

For `i > 0`, the cost to paint the `i`-th house with color `j` is the cost of painting the `i`-th house with color `j` plus the minimum cost of painting the `(i-1)`-th house with a different color. Therefore, we have:
\[ dp[i][0] = costs[i][0] + \min(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2]) \]
\[ dp[i][1] = costs[i][1] + \min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][2]) \]
\[ dp[i][2] = costs[i][2] + \min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1]) \]

After filling in the `dp` array, the minimum cost to paint all houses is the minimum value among `dp[n-1][0]`, `dp[n-1][1]`, and `dp[n-1][2]`.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def min_cost(costs):
    n = len(costs)
    dp = [[0] * 3 for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Base case
    dp[0][0] = costs[0][0]
    dp[0][1] = costs[0][1]
    dp[0][2] = costs[0][2]
    
    # Fill in the dp array
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i][0] = costs[i][0] + min(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2])
        dp[i][1] = costs[i][1] + min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][2])
        dp[i][2] = costs[i][2] + min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1])
    
    # Return the minimum cost
    return min(dp[n-1][0], dp[n-1][1], dp[n-1][2])

# Example 1

**Follow up:** Could you do it without any loop/recursion in `O(1)` runtime?
CoT: To solve the problem of repeatedly adding the digits of an integer until the result has only one digit, we can use the concept of the digital root. The digital root of a number is the value obtained by an iterative process of summing digits, on each iteration using the result from the previous iteration to compute a digit sum. The digital root of a non-zero integer is the single digit number that is equivalent to the original number modulo 9, with the exception that the digital root of 9 is 9.

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. If the number `num` is 0, return 0.
2. If the number `num` is not 0, find the remainder when `num` is divided by 9. If the remainder is 0, return 9. Otherwise, return the remainder.

This works because the digital root of a number `num` is congruent to `num` modulo 9, except when `num` is a multiple of 9, in which case the digital root is 9.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def digital_root(num):
    if num == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        remainder = num % 9
        if remainder == 0:
            return 9
        else:
            return remainder

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of index triplets \(i\), \(j\), \(k\) with \(0 \le i < j < k < n\) such that \(nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target\), we can use a combination of sorting and a two-pointer approach. Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Sort the array**: First, we sort the array `nums` in non-decreasing order. This will help us to efficiently find the triplets that satisfy the condition.

2. **Iterate through the array**: We iterate through the array with a loop where the index \(i\) goes from 0 to \(n-3\) (since \(i < j < k\), \(i\) can be at most \(n-3\)).

3. **Fix the first element**: For each \(i\), we fix the first element of the triplet as \(nums[i]\).

4. **Use two pointers**: We use two pointers, \(j\) and \(k\), to find the other two elements of the triplet. We start with \(j = i+1\) and \(k = n-1\). We then move the pointers based on the sum of the elements at these positions:
   - If \(nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target\), then all pairs \((j, k)\) will form a valid triplet with \(i\). So, we add the number of valid pairs to our result and move \(j\) to the right.
   - If \(nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] \ge target\), then we move \(k\) to the left.

5. **Update the result**: We continue this process until \(j\) and \(k\) meet or cross each other. For each valid triplet found, we add the number of valid pairs to our result.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def count_triplets(nums, target):
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    result = 0
    
    for i in range(n-2):
        j = i + 1
        k = n - 1
        while j < k:
            if nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target:

                j += 1
            else:
                k -= 1

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use the properties of the XOR operation. The XOR of a number with itself is 0, and the XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself. Therefore, if we XOR all the elements in the array, the result will be the XOR of the two unique elements, since all the other elements will cancel each other out.

Let's denote the two unique elements as `a` and `b`. Then, we have:
\[ a \oplus b = \text{XOR of all elements in the array} \]

Next, we need to find a way to separate `a` and `b`. We can do this by finding a bit that is set in either `a` or `b` but not in both. This bit will be set in the XOR result. We can use this bit to divide the elements into two groups: those with the bit set and those without the bit set. Since `a` and `b` have different values for this bit, they will be in different groups.

We can then XOR all the elements in each group. The result of each XOR operation will be one of the unique elements. This is because all the elements in each group will cancel each other out except for the unique element in that group.

Here is the Python code to implement this algorithm:
Response: python
def find_unique_elements(nums):
    # Step 1: Find the XOR of all elements in the array

    while set_bit & xor_all == 0:

CoT: To determine if the given edges form a valid tree, we need to check two conditions:
1. The graph is connected.
2. The graph has no cycles.

We can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to check these conditions. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize a visited array**: This array will keep track of the nodes that have been visited during the DFS.
2. ** Initialize a parent array**: This array will keep track of the parent of each node in the DFS tree. The parent of a node is the node from which it was visited.
3. **Perform DFS from each unvisited node**: Start the DFS from each node that has not been visited yet. During the DFS, mark each node as visited and set its parent.
4. **Check for cycles**: If we encounter a node that is already visited and is not the parent of the current node, then there is a cycle in the graph.
5. **Check for connectivity**: If there is any node that has not been visited after performing DFS from all nodes, then the graph is not connected.

**Explanation:** 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.

**Constraints:**

*   `-231 <= n <= 231 - 1`
CoT: To determine if a given integer `n` is an **ugly number**, we need to check if its prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, and `5`. We can do this by repeatedly dividing `n` by these prime numbers until `n` is no longer divisible by any of them. If the final value of `n` is `1`, then `n` is an **ugly number**. If the final value of `n` is not `1`, then `n` is not an **ugly number**.

Here is the Python code to implement this algorithm:
Response: python
def is_ugly_number(n):
    # Check if n is less than or equal to 0
    if n <= 0:
        return False

    # Divide n by 2 until it is no longer divisible by 2
    while n % 2 == 0:
        n //= 2

    # Divide n by 3 until it is no longer divisible by 3
    while n % 3 == 0:
        n //= 3

    # Divide n by 5 until it is no longer divisible by 5
    while n % 5 == 0:
        n //= 5

    # If n is 1, then it is an **ugly number**
    return n == 1

**Explanation:** 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 1690`
CoT: To find the \(n\)th ugly number, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will generate the sequence of ugly numbers up to the \(n\)th term.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize an array to store the ugly numbers:**
   \[
   \text{ugly} = [1]
   \]
   The first ugly number is 1.

2. ** Initialize three-pointers to keep track of the multiples of 2, 3, and 5:**
   \[
   i_2 = 0, \quad i_3 = 0, \quad i_5 = 0
   \]

3. ** Generate the next ugly number:**
   The next ugly number is the minimum of the following three values:
   \[
   \text{next\_ugly} = \min(\text{ugly}[i_2] \times 2, \text{ugly}[i_3] \times 3, \text{ugly}[i_5] \times 5)
   \]

4. ** Update the pointers:**
   - If \(\text{next\_ugly} = \text{ugly}[i_2] \times 2\), increment \(i_2\).
   - If \(\text{next\_ugly} = \text{ugly}[i_3] \times 3\), increment \(i_3\).
   - If \(\text{next\_ugly} = \text{ugly}[i_5] \times 5\), increment \(i_5\).

5. ** Repeat steps 3 and 4 until we have generated \(n\) ugly numbers.**

Here is the Python code to implement this algorithm:
Response: python
def nth_ugly_number(n):
    # Initialize the array to store the ugly numbers
    ugly = [1] * (n + 1)
    
    # Initialize the pointers
    i_2 = 0
    i_3 = 0
    i_5 = 0
    
    # Generate the next ugly number
    for i in range(1, n):
        next_ugly = min(ugly[i_2] * 2, ugly[i_3] * 3, ugly[i_5] * 5)
        ugly[i + 1] = next_ugly
        
        # Update the pointers
        if next_ugly == ugly[i_2] * 2:
            i_2 += 1
        if next_ugly == ugly[i_3] * 3:

Original Question: There are a row of `n` houses, each house can be painted with one of the `k` colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x k` cost matrix costs.

*   For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with color `0`; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house `1` with color `2`, and so on...

**Example 1:**

**Input:** costs = \[\[1,5,3\],\[2,9,4\]\]

Paint house 0 into color 0, paint house 1 into color 2. Minimum cost: 1 + 4 = 5;

**Follow up:** Could you solve it in `O(nk)` runtime?
CoT: To solve the problem of painting the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color and the total cost is minimized, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to paint the first `i` houses such that the `i`-th house is painted with color `j`.

The recurrence relation for `dp[i][j]` can be defined as:
\[ dp[i][j] = \min_{k \neq j}(dp[i-1][k]) + costs[i][j] \]
This means that the minimum cost to paint the `i`-th house with color `j` is the minimum cost to paint the `(i-1)`-th house with any color `k` (where `k` is not equal to `j`) plus the cost of painting the `i`-th house with color `j`.

We can initialize the `dp` array for the first house as:
\[ dp[0][j] = costs[0][j] \]
This means that the minimum cost to paint the first house with color `j` is simply the cost of painting the first house with color `j`.

Finally, the minimum cost to paint all the houses is the minimum value in the last row of the `dp` array:
\[ \min_{j}(dp[n-1][j]) \]

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def min_cost_to_paint_houses(costs):
    n, k = len(costs), len(costs[0])
    dp = [[0] * k for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Initialize the dp array for the first house
    for j in range(k):
        dp[0][j] = costs[0][j]
    
    # Fill the dp array using the recurrence relation
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(k):
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1]) + costs[i][j]
    
    # The minimum cost to paint all the houses is the minimum value in the last row of the dp array
    return min(dp[n-1])

# Example 1
costs1 = [[1, 5, 3], [2, 9, 4]]
print(min_cost_to_paint_houses(costs1))  # Output: 5

CoT: To determine if a permutation of a given string `s` can form a palindrome, we need to consider the properties of palindromes. A palindrome has the same characters on both sides of its center. Therefore, for a string to be a palindrome, it must have an even number of each character, except for at most one character that can appear an odd number of times (this character would be placed in the center of the palindrome).

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. Count the frequency of each character in the string `s`.
2. Check the counts to see if there is at most one character with an odd count. If there is more than one character with an odd count, then it is not possible to form a palindrome.

Let's implement this in Python:

CoT: To find all palindromic permutations of a given string `s`, we need to consider the properties of palindromes. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. This means that for a string to be a palindrome, the frequency of each character must be even, except for at most one character which can have an odd frequency.

Here is the step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Count the frequency of each character in the string `s`.**
2. **Check if the string can form a palindrome.**
   - If more than one character has an odd frequency, then it is not possible to form a palindrome.
   - If exactly one character has an odd frequency, then it can be placed in the middle of the palindrome.
   - If no character has an odd frequency, then all characters can be placed symmetrically.
3. **Generate all possible palindromic permutations.**
   - If there is a character with an odd frequency, place it in the middle and generate all permutations of the remaining characters on one side.
   - If no character has an odd frequency, generate all permutations of half of the characters and mirror them to form the other half.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the letters in the alien language based on the given sorted list of words. We can use a topological sort algorithm to find the order of the letters.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the letters and their dependencies:**
   - Create a set `letters` to store all unique letters in the words.
   - Create a dictionary ` depends` to store the dependencies between letters. The key is a letter, and the value is a list of letters that depend on it.

2. **弹珠 the dependencies:**
   - For each word in the list, iterate through its letters and add dependencies. If a letter appears before another letter in the word, add the letter that appears later to the list of dependencies of the letter that appears earlier.

3. **Perform topological sort:**
   - Use a topological sort algorithm to determine the order of the letters. Start with letters that have no dependencies and add them to a queue. Remove a letter from the queue and add its dependents to the queue.

4. **Check for cycles:**
   - If there are any cycles in the dependencies, there is no valid order for the letters. Return an empty string.

5. **Construct the result:**
   - If there are no cycles, return the order of the letters as a string.

Here's the Python code to implement this algorithm:

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary search tree and a `target` value, return _the value in the BST that is closest to the_ `target`. If there are multiple answers, print the smallest.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[4,2,5,1,3\], target = 3.714286
**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[1\], target = 4.428571
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 109`
*   `-109 <= target <= 109`

*   `0 <= Node.val <= 109`
*   `-109 <= target <= 109`
CoT: To find the value in a binary search tree (BST) that is closest to a given target value, we can use a recursive approach. We start at the root of the tree and compare the target value with the value of the current node. If the target value is less than the current node's value, we move to the left child. If the target value is greater than the current node's value, we move to the right child. We keep track of the closest value we have found so far as we traverse the tree.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:
Response: python
def closest_value(root, target):
    closest = root
    while root:
        if abs(target - root) < abs(target - closest):
            closest = root
        if target < root:
            root = root left
        else:
            root = root right
    return closest

Original Question: Design an algorithm to encode **a list of strings** to **a string**. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Machine 1 (sender) has the function:

string encode(vector strs) {
  // ... your code
  return encoded\_string;
}

Machine 2 (receiver) has the function:

vector decode(string s) {
  //... your code
  return strs;
}

So Machine 1 does:

string encoded\_string = encode(strs);

and Machine 2 does:

vector strs2 = decode(encoded\_string);

`strs2` in Machine 2 should be the same as `strs` in Machine 1.

Implement the `encode` and `decode` methods.

You are not allowed to solve the problem using any serialize methods (such as `eval`).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** dummy\_input = \[ "Hello ", "World "\]
**Output:** \[ "Hello ", "World "\]
**Explanation:**
Machine 1:
Codec encoder = new Codec();
String msg = encoder.encode(strs);
Machine 1 ---msg---> Machine 2

Machine 2:
Codec decoder = new Codec();
String\[\] strs = decoder.decode(msg);

**Example 2:**

**Input:** dummy\_input = \[ " "\]
**Output:** \[ " "\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
*   `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
*   `strs[i]` contains any possible characters out of `256` valid ASCII characters.

**Follow up:** Could you write a generalized algorithm to work on any possible set of characters?

**Follow up:** Could you write a generalized algorithm to work on any possible set of characters?
CoT: To solve the problem of encoding and decoding a list of strings to a single string and back, we can use a simple approach where we concatenate all the strings in the list with a unique separator. This separator will help us to distinguish between the different strings in the list when we decode it.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. ** encode **:
   - Initialize an empty string `encoded_string`.
   - Iterate through each string `str` in the list `strs`.
   - Add `str` to `encoded_string` followed by a unique separator (e.g., a dollar sign `:]

2. ** decode **:
   - Initialize an empty list `strs2`.
   - Iterate through the characters of `encoded_string`.
   - When we encounter the separator (e.g., a dollar sign `:'), we start a new string.
   - Add the current string to `strs2` and reset the current string.
   - After the last character in `encoded_string`, add the last string to `strs2`.

Here is the Python code implementing the above algorithm:
Response: python
def encode(strs):
    encoded_string = ""
    for str in strs:
        encoded_string += str + ":"
    return encoded_string[:-1]  # Remove the last separator

def decode(s):
    strs2 = []
    current_string = ""
    for char in s:
        if char == ::
            if current_string:
                strs2.append(current_string)
                current_string = ""
        else:
            current_string += char
    if current_string:
        strs2.append(current_string)
    return strs2

# Example usage
dummy_input = ["Hello ", "World"]
encoded_string = encode(dummy_input)
strs2 = decode(encoded_string)
print(strs2)  # Output: ["Hello ", "World"]

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary search tree, a `target` value, and an integer `k`, return _the_ `k` _values in the BST that are closest to the_ `target`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

You are **guaranteed** to have only one unique set of `k` values in the BST that are closest to the `target`.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the `k` values in a binary search tree (BST) that are closest to a given `target` value, we can use a combination of binary search and in-order traversal. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Convert the BST to an In-Order List:**
   Perform an in-order traversal of the binary search tree to convert it into a sorted list. This is because the in-order traversal of a binary search tree yields a sorted sequence of its elements.

2. **Find theIndex of the Target Value:**
   Use binary search to find the index of the target value in the sorted list. If the target value is not found, find the index where it would be if it were inserted into the list.

3. **Determine the Range of indices:**
   Once we have the index of the target value, we need to determine the range of indices in the sorted list that are within the `k` closest values to the target. This range will be centered around the index of the target value.

4. **Extract the k Closest Values:**
   Extract the `k` values from the sorted list based on the determined range of indices.

Let's implement this approach in Python:
Response: python
from bisect import bisect

def find_k_closest_values(root, target, k):
    # Step 1: Convert the BST to an in-order list
    in_order_list = []
    def in_order_traversal(node):
        if node is None:
            return
        in_order_traversal(node left)
        in_order_list.append(node val)
        in_order_traversal(node right)
    in_order_traversal(root)

    # Step 2: Find the index of the target value
    index = bisect(in_order_list, target)

    # Step 3: Determine the range of indices
    left_index = max(0, index - k // 2)
    right_index = min(len(in_order_list) - 1, index + k // 2)

    # Step 4: Extract the k closest values
    closest_values = in_order_list[left_index right_index + 1]
    if k % 2 == 1:
        closest_values.append(in_order_list[index])

    return closest_values

# Example usage
root = [4, 2, 5, 1, 3]
target = 3.714286
k = 2

**Example 1:**

**Input:** citations = \[3,0,6,1,5\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** \[3,0,6,1,5\] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.

CoT: To find the h-index of a researcher given an array of citations sorted in ascending order, we can use a binary search approach. The h-index is the maximum value of \( h \) such that the researcher has published at least \( h \) papers that have each been cited at least \( h \) times.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize the search range:**
   - The lower bound \( \text{low} \) is 0.
   - The upper bound \( \text{high} \) is the length of the citations array.

2. ** Binary search:**
   - While \( \text{low} \leq \text{high} \):
     - Calculate the middle index \( \text{mid} \) as \( \text{mid} = \frac{\text{low} + \text{high}}{2} \).
     - Check if the researcher has at least \( \text{mid} \) papers with at least \( \text{mid} \) citations each.
       - If \( \text{citations}[\text{mid} - 1] \geq \text{mid} \), then the researcher has at least \( \text{mid} \) papers with at least \( \text{mid} \) citations each. Set \( \text{low} = \text{mid} + 1 \).
       - If \( \text{citations}[\text{mid} - 1] < \text{mid} \), then the researcher does not have at least \( \text{mid} \) papers with at least \( \text{mid} \) citations each. Set \( \text{high} = \text{mid} - 1 \).

3. ** Return the result:**
   - After the binary search, the h-index is \( \text{high} \).

CoT: To solve the problem of painting a fence with \( n \) posts using \( k \) different colors such that no three consecutive posts have the same color, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define \( dp[i][j] \) as the number of ways to paint the first \( i \) posts such that the \( i \)-th post is painted with color \( j \).

The base cases are:
- For \( i = 1 \), any of the \( k \) colors can be used, so \( dp[1][j] = 1 \) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( k \).
- For \( i = 2 \), any of the \( k \) colors can be used for the second post, so \( dp[2][j] = k \) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( k \).

For \( i \geq 3 \), the \( i \)-th post can be painted with color \( j \) if the \((i-1)\)-th post is painted with a different color or the \((i-2)\)-th post is painted with a different color than the \((i-1)\)-th post. Therefore, we have:
\[ dp[i][j] = \sum_{l \neq j} dp[i-1][l] + \sum_{l \neq j} dp[i-2][l] \]
This can be simplified to:
\[ dp[i][j] = (k-1) \cdot (dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-2][j]) \]

However, a more efficient way to compute this is to use the following recurrence relation:
\[ dp[i] = (k-1) \cdot (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) \]
where \( dp[i] \) is the total number of ways to paint the first \( i \) posts.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def count_ways(n, k):
    if n == 1:
        return k
    if n == 2:
        return k * k
    
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = k
    dp[2] = k * k

You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given a helper function `bool knows(a, b)` that tells you whether `a` knows `b`. Implement a function `int findCelebrity(n)`. There will be exactly one celebrity if they are at the party.

Return _the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity at the party_. If there is no celebrity, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[1,1,0\],\[0,1,0\],\[1,1,1\]\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph\[i\]\[j\] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph\[i\]\[j\] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[1,0,1\],\[1,1,0\],\[0,1,1\]\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There is no celebrity.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == graph.length == graph[i].length`
*   `2 <= n <= 100`
*   `graph[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
*   `graph[i][i] == 1`

**Follow up:** If the maximum number of allowed calls to the API `knows` is `3 * n`, could you find a solution without exceeding the maximum number of calls?

CoT: To find the celebrity in a party with \( n \) people, we can use a divide-and-conquer approach. The key idea is to use the `knows` function to compare pairs of people and eliminate those who are not celebrities. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Divide the people into two groups**: If \( n \) is even, divide the people into two groups of size \( \frac{n}{2} \). If \( n \) is odd, divide the people into one group of size \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \) and one group of size \( \left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil \).

2. **Recursively find the celebrity in each group**: Use the `knows` function to determine if there is a celebrity in each group. If there is a celebrity in both groups, then the celebrity must be the one who knows the other. If there is a celebrity in only one group, then the celebrity is in that group.

3. **Combine the results**: If there is a celebrity in both groups, then the celebrity must be the one who knows the other. If there is a celebrity in only one group, then the celebrity is in that group.

4. **Base case**: If \( n = 1 \), then the only person is the celebrity.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def findCelebrity(n):
    def find in_group(graph, start, end):
        if start == end:
            return start
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        if knows(graph, mid, mid + 1):
            return find_in_group(graph, start, mid)
        else:
            return find_in_group(graph, mid + 1, end)

    graph = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            graph[i][j] = knows(i, j)

    return find_in_group(graph, 0, n - 1)

Original Question: You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, bad = 4
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:**
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1, bad = 1
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= bad <= n <= 231 - 1`

CoT: To find the first bad version in the sequence of product versions, we can use a binary search approach. This method minimizes the number of API calls by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize the search range:**
   - Start with the first version `left = 1`.
   - Set the last version `right = n`.

2. **Perform binary search:**
   - While `left < right`, do the following:
     - Calculate the middle version `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`.
     - If `isBad Version(mid)` returns `true`, the first bad version is in the right half of the range. Set `left = mid + 1`.
     - If `isBad Version(mid)` returns `false`, the first bad version is in the left half of the range. Set `right = mid`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - When `left == right`, `left` is the first bad version.

Here's the Python code implementing this binary search approach:
Response: python
def findFirstBad_version(n):
    left = 1
    right = n

    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2

            right = mid + 1
        else:
            left = mid

Original Question: Given an integer `n`, return _the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to_ `n`.

**Explanation:** 13 = 4 + 9.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 104`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to a given integer `n`, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize the DP Array:**
   - Create an array `dp` of size `n + 1` and set all elements to a large number (e.g., `float('inf')`).
   - Set `dp[0]` to `0` because the sum of zero perfect squares is zero.

2. **Iterate Through Each Number:**
   - For each number `i` from `1` to `n`, we will check if we can express `i` as the sum of perfect squares.

3. **Update the DP Array:**
   - For each `i`, iterate through all perfect squares `j * j` such that `j * j <= i`.
   - Update `dp[i]` by taking the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - j * j] + 1`.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - After iterating through all numbers, `dp[n]` will contain the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to `n`.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:
Response: python
import math

def min_perfect_squares(n):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, int(math.sqrt(i)) + 1):
            square = j * j
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - square] + 1)

    return dp[n]

# Example usage
n = 12
print(min_perfect_squares(n))  # Output: 3

n = 13
print(min_perfect_squares(n))  # Output: 2

CoT: To solve the problem of reordering the integer array `nums` such that `nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3]...`, we can use a two passes approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **First Pass:**
   - Sort the array `nums` in non-decreasing order.
   - This ensures that all elements are in ascending order.

2. **Second Pass:**
   - Starting from the second element, swap every pair of adjacent elements if they are both in increasing order (i.e., `nums[i] < nums[i+1]`).
   - This will ensure that the array alternates between increasing and decreasing order.

Let's implement this approach in Python:
Response: python
def alternate_order(nums):
    # First pass: Sort the array in non-decreasing order
    nums.sort()

    # Second pass: Swap every pair of adjacent elements if they are both in increasing order

Original Question: Given two vectors of integers `v1` and `v2`, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

Implement the `ZigzagIterator` class:

*   `ZigzagIterator(List v1, List v2)` initializes the object with the two vectors `v1` and `v2`.
*   `boolean hasNext()` returns `true` if the iterator still has elements, and `false` otherwise.
*   `int next()` returns the current element of the iterator and moves the iterator to the next element.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1,2\], v2 = \[3,4,5,6\]
**Output:** \[1,3,2,4,5,6\]
**Explanation:** By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: \[1,3,2,4,5,6\].

**Example 2:**

CoT: To implement the `Zigzagzag` iterator for two vectors, we can use a simple approach with two pointers to keep track of the current positions in each vector. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start of vectors `v1` and `v2` respectively.
2. Use a boolean variable `turn` to keep track of whether we should return an element from `v1` or `v2`. Initially, set `turn` to `True` to start with `v1`.
3. In each iteration of the `next` method, check if `i` is within the bounds of `v1` and `j` is within the bounds of `v2`. If `turn` is `True`, return `v1[i]` and increment `i`. If `turn` is `False`, return `v2[j]` and increment `j`.
4. After returning an element, flip the value of `turn` to ensure the next element is returned from the other vector.
5. If either `i` or `j` goes out of bounds, return `false` to indicate that the iterator has no more elements.

Here's the Python code for the `Zigzagzag` iterator:

        def __init__(self, v1, v2):

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to generate all possible expressions by inserting the binary operators `+`, `-`, and `*` between the digits of the string `num`. We will then evaluate each expression to check if it equals the target value.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define a recursive function** `find_expressions` that takes the current index `i` in the string `num`, the current expression `expr`, and the current value of the expression `val`.
2. **Base Case**: If the current index `i` is equal to the length of the string `num`, check if the current expression `expr` evaluates to the target value. If it does, add `expr` to the list of solutions.
3. **Recursive Case**: For each index `i`, iterate through the possible binary operators `+`, `-`, and `*`. Update the expression `expr` and the value `val` accordingly, and make a recursive call to `find_expressions` with the next index `i+1`.

Here is the Python code for the solution:

Attacked Question: Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Note** that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,0,3,12\]
**Output:** \[1,3,12,0,0\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0\]
**Output:** \[0\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you minimize the total number of operations done?
CoT: To solve the problem of moving all `0`'s to the end of an integer array `nums` while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, where `left` starts at the beginning of the array and `right` starts at the end of the array.
2. Iterate through the array with the `left` pointer until it finds a `0`.
3. Iterate through the array with the `right` pointer until it finds a non-zero element.
4. If `left` is at a `0` and `right` is at a non-zero element, swap the elements at positions `left` and `right`.
5. Move the `left` pointer one step to the right and the `right` pointer one step to the left.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until `left` and `right` meet or cross each other.

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def move_zeros_to_end(nums):
    left = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        if nums[left] == 0:
            left += 1
        elif nums[right] == 0:
            nums[left], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[left]
            right -= 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    
    return nums

Original Question: Design an iterator that supports the `peek` operation on an existing iterator in addition to the `hasNext` and the `next` operations.

Implement the `PeekingIterator` class:

*   `PeekingIterator(Iterator nums)` Initializes the object with the given integer iterator `iterator`.
*   `int next()` Returns the next element in the array and moves the pointer to the next element.
*   `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there are still elements in the array.
*   `int peek()` Returns the next element in the array **without** moving the pointer.

**Note:** Each language may have a different implementation of the constructor and `Iterator`, but they all support the `int next()` and `boolean hasNext()` functions.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "PeekingIterator ",  "next ",  "peek ",  "next ",  "next ",  "hasNext "\]
\[\[\[1, 2, 3\]\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, 1, 2, 2, 3, false\]

**Explanation**
PeekingIterator peekingIterator = new PeekingIterator(\[1, 2, 3\]); // \[**1**,2,3\]
peekingIterator.next();    // return 1, the pointer moves to the next element \[1,**2**,3\].
peekingIterator.peek();    // return 2, the pointer does not move \[1,**2**,3\].
peekingIterator.next();    // return 2, the pointer moves to the next element \[1,2,**3**\]
peekingIterator.next();    // return 3, the pointer moves to the next element \[1,2,3\]
peekingIterator.hasNext(); // return False

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
*   All the calls to `next` and `peek` are valid.
*   At most `1000` calls will be made to `next`, `hasNext`, and `peek`.

**Follow up:** How would you extend your design to be generic and work with all types, not just integer?

**Follow up:** How would you extend your design to be generic and work with all types, not just integer?
CoT: To design an iterator that supports the ` peek ` operation on an existing iterator in addition to the ` hasNext ` and the ` next ` operations, we can use a simple approach where we store the next element in a data structure along with the current position in the original iterator. This way, we can return the next element without moving the pointer in the original iterator.

Here is the implementation of the ` Peeking iterator ` class in Python:
Response: python
from itertools import islice

class Peeking iterator:
    def __init__(self, iterator):
        self iterator = iter(iterator)
        try:
            self.next_element = next(islice self iterator, 1)
        except StopIteration:
            self.next_element = None

    def next(self):
        if self.next_element is None:
            raise ValueError(" No more elements available")
        result = self.next_element
        try:
            self.next_element = next(islice self iterator, 1)

        return result

    def hasNext(self):
        return self.next_element is not None

    def peek(self):
        return self.next_element

# Example usage

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary search tree and a node `p` in it, return _the in-order successor of that node in the BST_. If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return `null`.

The successor of a node `p` is the node with the smallest key greater than `p.val`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[2,1,3\], p = 1
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1\], p = 6
**Output:** null
**Explanation:** There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is `null`.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
*   `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   All Nodes will have unique values.

*   All Nodes will have unique values.
CoT: To find the in-order successor of a given node `p` in a binary search tree (BST), we can follow these steps:

1. **If the node `p` has a right child:**
   - The in-order successor is the leftmost node in the right child's right子 tree. This is because the right child is greater than `p`, and the leftmost node in its right child's right子 tree will be the smallest node greater than `p`.

2. **If the node `p` does not have a right child:**
   - The in-order successor is the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of `p` and its rightmost ancestor. This is because the rightmost ancestor is the next node in the in-order sequence after `p`.

Let's implement this in Python using the given binary search tree structure.

Original Question: You are given an `m x n` grid `rooms` initialized with these three possible values.

*   `-1` A wall or an obstacle.
*   `0` A gate.
*   `INF` Infinity means an empty room. We use the value `231 - 1 = 2147483647` to represent `INF` as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than `2147483647`.

Fill each empty room with the distance to _its nearest gate_. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with `INF`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** rooms = \[\[2147483647,-1,0,2147483647\],\[2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1\],\[2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1\],\[0,-1,2147483647,2147483647\]\]

**Output:** \[\[-1\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == rooms.length`

CoT: To solve the problem of filling each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize the BFS queue**: Start by adding all the gates (positions with value `0`) to a queue.
2. **mn**: Keep track of the dimensions of the grid.
3. **Distance array**: Create a new 2D array `dist` of the same dimensions as `rooms` to store the distances from each room to the nearest gate. Initialize all distances with `2147483647` ( infinity).
4. **BFS loop**: While the queue is not empty, do the following:
   - Pop a position `(x, y)` from the queue.
   - Update the distance of the current position with the minimum distance found so far.
   - Check the neighboring positions (up, down, left, right) and if they are within the grid and have not been visited yet (i.e., their distance is still `2147483647`), update their distances and add them to the queue.
5. **Return the distance array**: After the BFS loop, the `dist` array will contain the distances from each room to the nearest gate. Return this array.

Here's the Python code implementing the above algorithm:

**Follow up:**

*   Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the repeated number in an array `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive, we can use the following approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have an array `nums` of length `n + 1`.
   - Each element in `nums` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive.
   - There is exactly one repeated number in `nums`.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - Since there are `n + 1` elements in `nums` and only `n` distinct numbers (from 1 to `n`), by the pigeonhole principle, at least one number must appear more than once.

3. ** Approach:**
   - We can use the properties of the array to find the repeated number without modifying the array and using only constant extra space.
   - One effective method is to use the **XOR** operation.

4. **Using XOR:**
   - The XOR operation has the property that `a XOR a = 0` and `a XOR 0 = a`.
   - We can XOR all the elements in `nums` and then XOR the result with all the numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - The result will be the repeated number because all other numbers will cancel out.

5. **Step-by-Step Solution:**
   - Initialize a variable `x` to 0.
   - Iterate through each element in `nums` and XOR it with `x`.
   - Iterate through each number from 1 to `n` and XOR it with `x`.
   - The final value of `x` will be the repeated number.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def find_repeated_number(nums):
    n = len(nums) - 1
    x = 0

    # XOR all elements in nums

    # XOR all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x ^= i

    return x

Original Question: According to [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life): "The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. "

The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: **live** (represented by a `1`) or **dead** (represented by a `0`). Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, return _the next state_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[0,1,0\],\[0,0,1\],\[1,1,1\],\[0,0,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[0,0,0\],\[1,0,1\],\[0,1,1\],\[0,1,0\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\[1,1\],\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[1,1\],\[1,1\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 25`
*   `board[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

**Follow up:**

*   Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
*   In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

*   All the words in `s` are separated by a **single space**.
CoT: To determine if the string `s` follows the same pattern as the given pattern, we need to check if there is a bijection (one-to-one correspondence) between each letter in the pattern and a non-empty word in the string `s`. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Count the frequency of each letter in the pattern:**
   We will use a dictionary to store the frequency of each letter in the pattern.

2. **Count the frequency of each word in the string:**
   We will use another dictionary to store the frequency of each word in the string.

3. **Compare the frequency dictionaries:**
   We need to check if the frequency of each letter in the pattern matches the frequency of each word in the string. If they do, and the number of unique letters in the pattern is equal to the number of unique words in the string, then the string follows the same pattern.

Let's implement this approach in Python:

def word pattern_match(pattern, s):
    # Step 1: Count the frequency of each letter in the pattern
    pattern_freq = {}
    for letter in pattern:
        if letter in pattern_freq:

Original Question: Given a `pattern` and a string `s`, return `true` _if_ `s` _**matches** the_ `pattern`_._

A string `s` **matches** a `pattern` if there is some **bijective mapping** of single characters to strings such that if each character in `pattern` is replaced by the string it maps to, then the resulting string is `s`. A **bijective mapping** means that no two characters map to the same string, and no character maps to two different strings.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** pattern =  "abab ", s =  "redblueredblue "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One possible mapping is as follows:
'a' ->  "red "
'b' ->  "blue "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** pattern =  "aaaa ", s =  "asdasdasdasd "

**Explanation:** One possible mapping is as follows:

*   `pattern` and `s` consist of only lowercase English letters.
CoT: To determine if a string `s` matches a pattern, we need to check if there exists a bijective mapping of single characters to strings such that replacing each character in the pattern with its corresponding string in the mapping results in the string `s`. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. **Check the lengths of the pattern and the string:**
   If the lengths of the pattern and the string are not equal, it is impossible for the string to match the pattern. This is because a bijective mapping requires that each character in the pattern corresponds to exactly one string in the mapping, and vice versa.

2. **Create a mapping from characters to strings:**
   Iterate through the pattern and the string simultaneously, and map each character in the pattern to the corresponding string in the mapping. If a character in the pattern has already been mapped to a different string, or if a string in the mapping has already been mapped to a different character, then the mapping is not bijective, and the string does not match the pattern.

3. **Check if the mapping is bijective:**
   After iterating through the pattern and the string, check if the mapping is bijective by ensuring that each character in the pattern has been mapped to a unique string, and each string has been mapped to a unique character. If the mapping is not bijective, then the string does not match the pattern.

4. **Replace each character in the pattern with its corresponding string in the mapping:**
   If the mapping is bijective, replace each character in the pattern with its corresponding string in the mapping to form a new string. Check if this new string is equal to the given string `s`. If it is equal, then the string matches the pattern.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def pattern matching(pattern, s):
    # Check if the lengths of the pattern and the string are equal
    if len(pattern)!= len(s):
        return False

    # Create a mapping from characters to strings
    mapping = {}
    for i in range(len(pattern)):

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`
CoT: To determine if you can win the Nim Game given the number of stones `n`, we need to analyze the game's strategy. The key insight is that the player who faces a heap with a number of stones that is a multiple of 4 will always lose if both players play optimally. This is because the player can only remove 1, 2, or 3 stones, and no matter which number of stones they remove, the opponent can always adjust their move to leave a multiple of 4 stones for the first player.

Let's break down the reasoning:

1. If `n` is a multiple of 4, the first player (you) will always lose. This is because whatever number of stones you remove (1, 2, or 3), the second player can always remove a number of stones to make the total number of stones removed in that round equal to 4. This will leave a multiple of 4 stones for you again, and the process will repeat until there are no stones left.
2. If `n` is not a multiple of 4, the first player (you) can always win. This is because you can remove a number of stones to leave a multiple of 4 stones for the second player. For example, if `n` is 1 more than a multiple of 4 (i.e., `n = 4k + 1`), you can remove 1 stone to leave `4k` stones. If `n` is 2 more than a multiple of 4 (i.e., `n = 4k + 2`), you can remove 2 stones to leave `4k` stones. If `n` is 3 more than a multiple of 4 (i.e., `n = 4k + 3`), you can remove 3 stones to leave `4k` stones. In all these cases, you leave a multiple of 4 stones for the second player, and the second player will lose if both players play optimally.

Based on this reasoning, we can write the following Python code to determine if you can win the game:

CoT: To solve the problem, we need to find all possible states of the string `currentState` after one valid move. A valid move is defined as flipping two consecutive `"++"` into `"--"`. Let's break down the solution step by step.

1. **Identify the positions where a move can be made:**
   We need to find all positions in the string where there are two consecutive `"++"`. We can do this by iterating through the string and checking each pair of adjacent characters.

2. **Generate all possible states after a move:**
   For each position where a move can be made, we will flip the two consecutive `"++"` into `"--"`. This will give us a new state of the string. We will store all these new states in a list.

3. **Return the list of all possible states:**
   After iterating through the entire string, we will return the list of all possible states.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python

    n = len(current_state)
    possible_states = []
    
    for i in range(n - 1):

CoT: To determine if the starting player can guarantee a win in the Flip Game, we need to analyze the game's state and the possible moves. The key is to use the concept of a "winning position" and a "losing position". A winning position is one where the player whose turn it is can force a win, and a losing position is one where any move the player makes will leave the opponent in a winning position.

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let's define a function `can_win(current_state)` that returns `True` if the starting player can guarantee a win from the current state, and `False` otherwise.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. **Base Case**: If the current state is empty or has only one character, the starting player cannot make a move, so the starting player loses. Therefore, `can_win("") = False` and `can_win("+") = False`.

2. **Recursive Case**: For a state with more than one character, the starting player can make a move if there are two consecutive `++` in the state. If the starting player makes a move, the state will change to a new state where the two consecutive `++` are replaced with `--`. The starting player will win if the new state is a losing position for the opponent.

3. **Dynamic Programming**: We can use a bottom-up approach to fill in a table of winning and losing states. We start from the smallest states and work our way up to the largest state.

Here is the Python code to implement this algorithm:
Response: python
def can_win(current_state):
    # Create a table to store the winning and losing states
    dp = [False] * (len(current_state) + 1)
    
    # Base cases
    dp[0] = False
    dp[1] = False
    
    # Fill in the table
    for i in range(2, len(current_state) + 1):
        if current_state[i-2:i] == "++":
            dp[i] = not dp[i-2]
        else:
            dp[i] = dp[i-1]
    
    return dp[len(current_state)]

# Example usage
print(can_win("++++ "))

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the median of a data stream, we can use a combination of two Heaps: a Max heap to store the smaller half of the numbers and a Min heap to store the larger half of the numbers. This approach ensures that the median can be found in constant time after each addition.

Here is the step-by-step implementation in Python:

1. **Initialize the Heaps:**
   - Create a Max heap to store the smaller half of the numbers.
   - Create a Min heap to store the larger half of the numbers.

2. **Add a Number:**
   - If the number is less than or equal to the root of the Max heap, add it to the Max heap.
   - If the number is greater than the root of the Max heap, add it to the Min heap.
   - After adding the number, ensure that the sizes of the two Heaps differ by at most 1. If they differ by more than 1, remove the root from the heap that has more elements.

3. **Find the Median:**
   - If the sizes of the two Heaps are equal, the median is the average of the roots of the two Heaps.
   - If the Max heap has more elements than the Min heap, the median is the root of the Max heap.
   - If the Min heap has more elements than the Max heap, the median is the root of the Min heap.

Here is the Python code for the MedianFinder class:

    def __init__(self):

        self.min_heap = []

        else:
            heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, num)
        
        # Ensure the sizes of the two Heaps differ by at most 1
        if len(self.max_heap) > len(self.min_heap) + 1:
            heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, -heapq.heappop(self.max_heap))
        elif len self.min_heap) > len self.max_heap):

Original Question: Given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where each `1` marks the home of one friend, return _the minimal **total travel distance**_.

The **total travel distance** is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.

The distance is calculated using [Manhattan Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), where `distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,0,0,0,1\],\[0,0,0,0,0\],\[0,0,1,0,0\]\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Given three friends living at (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2).
The point (0,2) is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 is minimal.
So return 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,1\]\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
*   There will be **at least two** friends in the `grid`.

*   `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
*   There will be **at least two** friends in the `grid`.
CoT: To find the minimal total travel distance for all friends to meet at a single point in an \(m \times n\) binary grid, we can use the concept of the median. The median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations from a given set of points. Therefore, we need to find the median of the x-coordinates and the median of the y-coordinates of the friends.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the coordinates of all friends:**
   Iterate through the grid and collect the coordinates of all cells that contain a `1`.

2. **Find the median of the x-coordinates and the median of the y-coordinates:**
   Use a sorting algorithm to sort the x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately. Then, find the median of each sorted list. If the number of friends is odd, the median is the middle element. If the number of friends is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

3. **Calculate the total travel distance:**
   For each friend, calculate the Manhattan distance from their coordinates to the median coordinates. Sum these distances to get the total travel distance.

Let's implement this solution in Python:
Response: python
import numpy as np

def min_total_distance(grid):
    # Identify the coordinates of all friends
    friends = []
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[i])):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                friends.append((i, j))

    # Find the median of the x-coordinates and the median of the y-coordinates
    x coordinates = [ coordinate[0] for coordinate in friends ]
    y coordinates = [ coordinate[1] for coordinate in friends ]
    x_median = np.median(x coordinates)
    y_median = np.median(y coordinates)

    # Calculate the total travel distance
    total_distance = sum(abs(x - x_median) + abs(y - y_median) for x, y in friends)
    return total_distance

# Example 1
grid1 = [[1,0,0,0,1], [0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,1,0,0]]
print(min_total_distance(grid1))  # Output: 6

# Example 2

Original Question: Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

CoT: To solve the problem of serialize and deserialize a binary tree, we can use a recursive approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. ** Serialization:**
   - If the tree is empty (root is `None`), return an empty string.
   - Otherwise, recursively serialize the left subtree, then the right subtree.
   - separate the serialized left and right subtrees with a root value and a null value to indicate the end of the left and right subtrees.

2. ** Deserialization:**
   - If the input string is empty, return `None`.
   - Otherwise, split the string by the null value to get the root value and the serialized left and right subtrees.
   - Recursively deserialize the left and right subtrees and combine them with the root value to form the original tree.

Here's the Python code implementing this algorithm:

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the length of the longest **consecutive sequence path**_.

A **consecutive sequence path** is a path where the values **increase by one** along the path.

Note that the path can start **at any node** in the tree, and you cannot go from a node to its parent in the path.

*   `-3 * 104 <= Node.val <= 3 * 104`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the length of the longest consecutive sequence path in a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will keep track of the longest consecutive sequence path found so far and update it as we traverse the tree.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Define a function ` longConsecutivePath `** that takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns the length of the longest consecutive sequence path.

2. ** Initialize a variable ` max_length ` ** to 0. This variable will store the length of the longest consecutive sequence path found so far.

3. ** Define a helper function ` dfs ` ** that takes a node and its parent value as input. This function will return the length of the longest consecutive sequence path starting from the given node.

4. ** In the ` dfs ` function:**
   - If the node is ` null`, return 0.
   - If the value of the node is equal to the parent value + 1, the current path is consecutive. Otherwise, the current path is not consecutive.
   - Calculate the length of the consecutive sequence path starting from the current node by taking the maximum of:
     - The length of the consecutive sequence path starting from the left child.
     - The length of the consecutive sequence path starting from the right child.
     - 1 (if the current path is consecutive).
   - Update the ` max_length ` variable by taking the maximum of the current ` max_length ` and the length of the consecutive sequence path starting from the current node.

5. ** In the ` longConsecutivePath ` function:**
   - call the ` dfs ` function with the root node and a parent value of 0.
   - return the ` max_length ` variable.

Here is the Python code implementing the above approach:
Response: python
class binaryTree:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self value = value
        self left = None
        self right = None

    def dfs(node, parent_value):
        nonlocal max_length

        if not node:

        if node value == parent_value + 1:
            max_length = max(max_length, dfs(node left, node value) + 1)
            max_length = max(max_length, dfs(node right, node value) + 1)

        return max(max_length, 1)

Original Question: You are playing the **[Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows)** game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

*   The number of "bulls ", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
*   The number of "cows ", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

Given the secret number `secret` and your friend's guess `guess`, return _the hint for your friend's guess_.

The hint should be formatted as `"xAyB "`, where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows. Note that both `secret` and `guess` may contain duplicate digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** secret =  "1807 ", guess =  "7810 "
**Output:**  "1A3B "

   - We can iterate through both the secret and the guess and count the number of positions where the digits match.

2. **Count the number of cows:**
   - A cow is a digit in the guess that is in the secret number but is located in the wrong position.
   - We can use a frequency count to determine how many times each digit appears in both the secret and the guess.
   - For each digit that appears in both the secret and the guess, we subtract the number of times it appears as a bull from the total count of that digit in the secret. This gives us the number of cows for that digit.
   - We sum up the cows for all digits to get the total number of cows.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def bulls_and_cows(secret, guess):
    # Step 1: Count the number of bulls
    bulls = sum(1 for i in range(len(secret)) if secret[i] == guess[i])

    # Step 2: Count the number of cows
    secret_count = {}
    guess_count = {}
    
    # Count the frequency of each digit in the secret
    for digit in secret:
        if digit in secret_count:
            secret_count[digit] += 1
        else:
            secret_count[digit] = 1
    
    # Count the frequency of each digit in the guess
    for digit in guess:
        if digit in guess_count:
            guess_count[digit] += 1
        else:
            guess_count[digit] = 1
    
    cows = sum(min(secret_count[digit], guess_count[digit]) - (1 if secret_count[digit] == guess_count[digit] else 0) for digit in set(secret) | set(guess))

    # Return the hint
    return f"{bulls}A{cows}B"

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums`, return _the length of the longest **strictly increasing**_ _**subsequence**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest increasing subsequence is \[2,3,7,101\], therefore the length is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,0,3,2,3\]
**Output:** 4

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[7,7,7,7,7,7,7\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(n log(n))` time complexity?

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(n log(n))` time complexity?
CoT: To find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in an integer array `nums`, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create an array `dp` of the same length as `nums` and initialize all elements to 1. This array will store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index.

2. **Iterate through the array:**
   - For each element `nums[i]` in the array, iterate through all previous elements `nums[j]` where `j < i`.
   - If `nums[i] > nums[j]`, it means `nums[i]` can extend the increasing subsequence ending at `nums[j]`. Update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

3. **Find the maximum length:**
   - After iterating through the entire array, the maximum value in the `dp` array will be the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

Here's the Python code implementing this algorithm:
Response: python
def length_of_longest_increasing_subsequence(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [1] * n

    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

    return max(dp)

*   `1 <= s.length <= 25`
*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters and parentheses `'('` and `')'`.
*   There will be at most `20` parentheses in `s`.
CoT: To solve the problem of removing the minimum number of invalid parentheses to make a string valid, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will keep track of the number of open parentheses and close parentheses as we iterate through the string. If we encounter a close parentheses before an open parentheses, it means the close parentheses is invalid and we can consider removing it. We will use a recursive function to explore all possible combinations of removing parentheses and check if the resulting string is valid.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Define a function `is_valid(s)` to check if a string `s` is valid. A string is valid if the number of open parentheses is equal to the number of close parentheses and at any point in the string, the number of open parentheses is greater than or equal to the number of close parentheses.
2. Define a function `df(s, open, close, path)` to perform DFS. This function will iterate through the string `s` and for each character, it will either add it to the path if it is an open parentheses or check if it is a close parentheses. If it is a close parentheses and the number of open parentheses is greater than or equal to the number of close parentheses, it means the close parentheses is valid and we can add it to the path. If the close parentheses is invalid, we can consider removing it by not adding it to the path. We will also keep track of the minimum number of removals needed to make the string valid.
3. After the DFS, we will have a list of all valid strings with the minimum number of removals. We will return this list.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def is_valid(s):
    open_count = 0
    close_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            open_count += 1
        elif char == ')':
            close_count += 1
            if open_count < close_count:
                return False
    return open_count == close_count

def df(s, open, close, path, removals):
    if not s:
        if is_valid(path) and removals == 0:
            return [path]
        return []
    
    result = []
    if s[0] == '(':
        result += df(s[1:], open + 1, close, path + '(')
    else:

Original Question: You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `image` where `0` represents a white pixel and `1` represents a black pixel.

The black pixels are connected (i.e., there is only one black region). Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically.

Given two integers `x` and `y` that represents the location of one of the black pixels, return _the area of the smallest (axis-aligned) rectangle that encloses all black pixels_.

You must write an algorithm with less than `O(mn)` runtime complexity

**Example 1:**

**Input:** image = \[\[ "0 ", "0 ", "1 ", "0 "\],\[ "0 ", "1 ", "1 ", "0 "\],\[ "0 ", "1 ", "0 ", "0 "\]\], x = 0, y = 2

CoT: To find the area of the smallest axis-aligned rectangle that encloses all black pixels in the given binary matrix, we can use a method that involves determining the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the black pixels. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. ** Initialize variables to store the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the black pixels.**
   - Let `min_row` be the minimum row index.
   - Let `max_row` be the maximum row index.
   - Let `min_col` be the minimum column index.
   - Let `max_col` be the maximum column index.
   - Initialize these variables to the indices of the given black pixel \((x, y)\).

2. ** Iterate through each row and column of the matrix to update the minimum and maximum indices.**
   - For each row, check if there is a black pixel in that row. If there is, update `min_row` and `max_row` accordingly.
   - For each column, check if there is a black pixel in that column. If there is, update `min_col` and `max_col` accordingly.

3. ** Calculate the area of the rectangle using the minimum and maximum indices.**
   - The width of the rectangle is `max_col - min_col + 1`.
   - The height of the rectangle is `max_row - min_row + 1`.
   - The area is the product of the width and the height.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:

def min_area rectangle(image, x, y):
    m = len(image)
    n = len(image[0])
    
    min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col = x, x, y, y

1.  Calculate the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** where `left <= right`.

*   `NumArray(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer array `nums`.
*   `int sumRange(int left, int right)` Returns the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** (i.e. `nums[left] + nums[left + 1] + ... + nums[right]`).

CoT: To efficiently handle the sum range queries on an integer array `nums`, we can use the concept of prefix sums. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to and including the element at index `i`. With this information, we can calculate the sum of any range in constant time.

Here's how we can implement the `Num Array` class:

1. ** Initialize the prefix sum array:**
   - Create a new array `prefixSums` of the same length as `nums`.
   - Set `prefixSums[0]` to `nums[0]`.
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, set `prefixSums[i]` to `prefixSums[i-1] + nums[i]`.

2. **Implement the `sumRange` method:**
   - If `left == 0`, return `prefixSums[right]` (the sum of the first `right+1` elements).
   - Otherwise, return `prefixSums[right] - prefixSums[left-1]` (the sum of the elements from `left` to `right` inclusive).

Here's the Python code for the implementation:
Response: python
def Num Array(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    prefixSums = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):

    if left == 0:
        return prefixSums[right]
    else:

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a technique called **prefix sums**. We will precompute the sum of all elements in the submatrix from the top-left corner to each cell in the matrix. This way, we can answer each `sumRegion` query in constant time by subtracting the appropriate prefix sums.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the prefix sum matrix:**
   - Create a new matrix `prefixSum` of the same dimensions as `matrix`.
   - For each cell `(i, j)` in `prefixSum`, calculate the sum of all elements in the submatrix from \((0, 0)\) to \((i, j)\).

2. **Calculate the prefix sums:**
   - For each row `i` in `matrix`:
     - For each column `j` in `matrix`:
       - If `i` is 0 and `j` is 0, `prefixSum[i][j]` is simply `matrix[i][j]`.
       - If `i` is 0, `prefixSum[i][j]` is the sum of `prefixSum[i][j-1]` and `matrix[i][j]`.
       - If `j` is 0, `prefixSum[i][j]` is the sum of `prefixSum[i-1][j]` and `matrix[i][j]`.
       - Otherwise, `prefixSum[i][j]` is the sum of `prefixSum[i-1][j]`, `prefixSum[i][j-1]`, and `matrix[i][j]` minus `prefixSum[i-1][j-1]` (to avoid double-counting).

3. ** answer the `sumRegion` queries:**
   - For each query with coordinates \((row1, col1, row2, col2)\):
     - The sum of the elements in the rectangle is given by:
       \[

Original Question: You are given an empty 2D binary grid `grid` of size `m x n`. The grid represents a map where `0`'s represent water and `1`'s represent land. Initially, all the cells of `grid` are water cells (i.e., all the cells are `0`'s).

We may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land. You are given an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [ri, ci]` is the position `(ri, ci)` at which we should operate the `ith` operation.

Return _an array of integers_ `answer` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the number of islands after turning the cell_ `(ri, ci)` _into a land_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 3, positions = \[\[0,0\],\[0,1\],\[1,2\],\[2,1\]\]
**Output:** \[1,1,2,3\]
**Explanation:**
Initially, the 2d grid is filled with water.
- Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid\[0\]\[0\] into a land. We have 1 island.
- Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid\[0\]\[1\] into a land. We still have 1 island.
- Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid\[1\]\[2\] into a land. We have 2 islands.
- Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid\[2\]\[1\] into a land. We have 3 islands.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 1, n = 1, positions = \[\[0,0\]\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= m, n, positions.length <= 104`
*   `1 <= m * n <= 104`
*   `positions[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= ri < m`
*   `0 <= ci < n`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it in time complexity `O(k log(mn))`, where `k == positions.length`?

CoT: To solve the problem of determining the number of islands after each add land operation in a 2D binary grid, we can use a union find algorithm. The union find algorithm is an efficient way to maintain a collection of disjoint sets and perform operations such as finding the set to which a given element belongs and merging two sets.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the Union Find Data Structure:**
   - Create an array `root` of size `m * n` where each element represents the root of a set. Initially, all elements are their own roots.
   - Create an array ` size` of size `m * n` where each element represents the size of the set to which it belongs. Initially, all elements have a size of 1.

2. **Define the Union Function:**
   - The union function takes two roots and合并 their sets.
   - Find the roots of the two given elements using path finding ()bfs).
   - If the roots are different, merge the smaller set into the larger set by changing the root of the smaller set to the root of the larger set.
   - Update the size of the larger set by adding the size of the smaller set.

3. **Define the Path Finding Function:**
   - The path finding function takes a root and returns the root of the set to which it belongs.
   - Use a loop to follow the roots until reach the root of the set.

4. ** Process Each Add Land Operation:**
   - For each operation in `positions`, convert the 2D coordinates \((r, c)\) to a 1D index `i` using the formula `i = r * n + c`.
   - Perform the union operation on the roots of the two adjacent cells (if they are water cells).
   - Update the number of islands by checking if the root of the new land cell is a new root (i.e., it was previously a water cell).

5. **Return the Result:**
   - After processing all operations, return the array of the number of islands after each operation.

Here is the Python code implementing the above steps:
Response: python
def union root1, root2, size):
    root1_root = find_root(root1)
    root2_root = find_root(root2)
    if root1_root!= root2_root:
        if size[root1_root] < size[root2_root]:
            root1_root = root2_root
            size[root1_root] += size[root2_root]
        else:
            root2_root = root1_root
            size[root1_root] += size[root2_root]
    return root1_root

def find_root(root):
    while root!= root:
        root = root
    return root

def add_land(m, n, positions):
    root = [i for i in range(m * n)]
    size = [1] * (m * n)
    result = []
    for r, c in positions:
        i = r * n + c
        if root[i] == i:  # It is a water cell
            new_root = union(root[i], root[i + 1], size)
            new_root = union(root[i], root[i + n], size)
            new_root = union(root[i], root[i - 1], size)
            new_root = union(root[i], root[i - n], size)
            result.append(len(set(root)))
    return result

m = 3
n = 3
positions = [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1]]

Original Question: An **additive number** is a string whose digits can form an **additive sequence**.

A valid **additive sequence** should contain **at least** three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Given a string containing only digits, return `true` if it is an **additive number** or `false` otherwise.

**Note:** Numbers in the additive sequence **cannot** have leading zeros, so sequence `1, 2, 03` or `1, 02, 3` is invalid.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  "112358 "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8

**Example 2:**

**Input:**  "199100199 "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199. 
1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num.length <= 35`
*   `num` consists only of digits.

**Follow up:** How would you handle overflow for very large input integers?
CoT: To determine if a given string is an additive number, we need to check if its digits can form an additive sequence. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Define a function to check if a sequence is additive:**
   - We need to ensure that the sequence has at least three numbers.
   - Each subsequent number must be the sum of the preceding two numbers.
   - Numbers in the sequence cannot have leading zeros.

2. **Iterate through possible starting points and lengths of the sequence:**
   - We will try different starting points and lengths to see if we can form a valid additive sequence.

3. **Convert the string to a list of integers:**
   - This will allow us to easily manipulate and check the digits.

4. **Check each possible sequence:**
   - For each starting point and length, check if the sequence formed by the digits is additive.

5. **Return the result:**
   - If we find a valid additive sequence, return `true`.
   - If no valid additive sequence is found, return `false`.

Here's the Python code to implement this approach:
Response: python
def is_additive_number(num):
    digits = [int(d) for d in num]
    n = len(digits)
    
    for start in range(n):
        for length in range(3, n + 1):
            sequence = digits[start:start + length]
            if is_additive(sequence):
                return True
    
    return False

        if sequence[i]!= sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2]:
            return False
    
    return True

1.  **Update** the value of an element in `nums`.
2.  Calculate the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** where `left <= right`.

Implement the `NumArray` class:

*   `NumArray(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer array `nums`.
*   `void update(int index, int val)` **Updates** the value of `nums[index]` to be `val`.
*   `int sumRange(int left, int right)` Returns the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** (i.e. `nums[left] + nums[left + 1] + ... + nums[right]`).

**Example 1:**

\[ "NumArray ",  "sumRange ",  "update ",  "sumRange "\]
\[\[\[1, 3, 5\]\], \[0, 2\], \[1, 2\], \[0, 2\]\]

CoT: To efficiently handle the given queries, we can use a segment tree. A segment tree is a binary tree where each node represents a range of the array. The root node represents the entire array, and each child node represents a sub-range of the array. This structure allows us to perform range sum queries and update individual elements in logarithmic time.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Initialize the segment tree:**
   - The segment tree will have a size of \(4 \times n\) where \(n\) is the length of the array. This is because each level of the segment tree will have approximately half the number of nodes as the previous level, and the total number of nodes in a complete binary tree with \(n\) leaves is \(2n - 1\). However, we use \(4n\) to ensure that we have enough space for all nodes.
   - Each node in the segment tree will store the sum of the elements in its corresponding range.

2. ** build the segment tree:**
   - Start from the leaves and work up to the root.
   - Each leaf node will store the value of the corresponding element in the array.
   - Each non-leaf node will store the sum of the values of its two child nodes.

3. ** Update an element:**
   - Start from the root and find the leaf node that corresponds to the element to be updated.
   - Update the value of the leaf node.
   - Update the values of all the non-leaf nodes on the path from the leaf node to the root.

4. ** Sum a range:**
   - Start from the root and recursively find the sum of the elements in the range.
   - If the range is completely within the left child's range, return the sum of the left child.
   - If the range is completely within the right child's range, return the sum of the right child.
   - If the range intersects both children's ranges, return the sum of the left child, the right child, and the sum of the elements in the range that is not covered by either child.

**Output**
\[null, 8, null, 10\]

**Explanation**
NumMatrix numMatrix = new NumMatrix(\[\[3, 0, 1, 4, 2\], \[5, 6, 3, 2, 1\], \[1, 2, 0, 1, 5\], \[4, 1, 0, 1, 7\], \[1, 0, 3, 0, 5\]\]);

numMatrix.update(3, 2, 2);       // matrix changes from left image to right image

**Constraints:**

CoT: To efficiently handle the given queries, we can use a 2D prefix sum array. This array will store the sum of all elements in the submatrix from the top-left corner to each cell in the original matrix. This allows us to calculate the sum of any rectangular region in constant time.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Initialize the NumMatrix object:**
   - Create a 2D prefix sum array `prefixSum` with dimensions `m+1` by `n+1` and initialize it with zeros.
   - Fill the prefix sum array by iterating through the original matrix and adding the current element to the prefix sum of the cell above it and to the left of it.

2. **Update the value of a cell:**
   - Update the prefix sum of the cell and all cells below it and to the right of it by adding the difference between the new value and the old value.

3. **Calculate the sum of a rectangular region:**
   - Use the prefix sum array to find the sum of the elements in the rectangular region by subtracting the prefix sum of the top-left corner from the prefix sum of the bottom-right corner.

Here is the Python code for the NumMatrix class:
Response: python
import numpy as np

def __init__(self, matrix):
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    self(prefixSum) = np.zeros((m+1, n+1), dtype=int)
    
    # Fill the prefix sum array
    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            self(prefixSum[i][j]) = matrix[i-1][j-1] + self(prefixSum[i-1][j]) + self(prefixSum[i][j-1]) - self(prefixSum[i-1][j-1])
    
def update(self, row, col, val):
    m, n = len(self(prefixSum)) - 1, len(self prefixSum[0]) - 1
    self(prefixSum[row+1][col+1]) += val - self prefixSum[row][col]
    
    # Update all cells below it and to the right of it
    for i in range(row+1, m+1):
        self(prefixSum[i][col+1]) += val - self prefixSum[i-1][col]
    for j in range(col+1, n+1):
        self(prefixSum[row+1][j+1]) += val - self prefixSum[row+1][j]
    
    # Update the cell itself
    self(prefixSum[row+1][col+1]) += val - self prefixSum[row][col]
    
def sumRegion(self, row1, col1, row2, col2):
    m, n = len(self prefixSum) - 1, len(self prefixSum[0]) - 1
    return self prefixSum[row2+1][col2+1] - self prefixSum[row2+1][col1] - self prefixSum[row1][col2+1] + self prefixSum[row1][col1]

Original Question: You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

*   After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[1,2,3,0,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** transactions = \[buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = \[1\]
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= prices.length <= 5000`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = \[1\]
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= prices.length <= 5000`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We define two arrays, `dp_buy` and `dp_sell`, where `dp_buy[i]` is the maximum profit we can achieve on day `i` if we buy the stock on that day, and `dp_sell[i]` is the maximum profit we can achieve on day `i` if we sell the stock on that day.

The recurrence relations for these arrays are:
- `dp_buy[i] = max(dp_buy[i-1], dp_sell[i-2] - prices[i])`
- `dp_sell[i] = max(dp_sell[i-1], dp_buy[i-1] + prices[i])`

We initialize `dp_buy[0]` to `-prices[0]` (since we buy the stock on the first day) and `dp_sell[0]` to `0` (since we don't have any profit if we sell the stock on the first day).

We then iterate through the array and update `dp_buy` and `dp_sell` according to the recurrence relations. The maximum profit we can achieve is the maximum value in `dp_sell` at the end of the array.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:
Response: python
def maxProfit(prices):
    if not prices:
        return 0
    
    n = len(prices)
    dp_buy = [-prices[0]] * n
    dp_sell = [0] * n
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp_buy[i] = max(dp_buy[i-1], dp_sell[i-2] - prices[i])
        dp_sell[i] = max(dp_sell[i-1], dp_buy[i-1] + prices[i])
    
    return dp_sell[-1]

Original Question: A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by _exactly_ one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`) are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs).

Return _a list of all **MHTs'** root labels_. You can return the answer in **any order**.

The **height** of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = \[\[1,0\],\[1,2\],\[1,3\]\]
**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 6, edges = \[\[3,0\],\[3,1\],\[3,2\],\[3,4\],\[5,4\]\]
**Output:** \[3,4\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
*   `edges.length == n - 1`
*   `0 <= ai, bi < n`
*   `ai != bi`
*   All the pairs `(ai, bi)` are distinct.
*   The given input is **guaranteed** to be a tree and there will be **no repeated** edges.

*   The given input is **guaranteed** to be a tree and there will be **no repeated** edges.
CoT: To find all minimum height trees (MHTs) in a given tree, we can use a bottom-up approach. The key idea is to calculate the height of each node from its children and then determine the height of the tree when each node is considered as the root.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Convert the edges to an adjacency list**: This will help us to iterate over the children of each node.
2. **Calculate the height of each node from its children**: We start from the leaves and move up to the root. For each node, its height is 1 plus the maximum height of its children.
3. **Determine the height of the tree when each node is the root**: The height of the tree when a node \( x \) is the root is the maximum height of its children plus 1 (the edge from the root to its children).
4. **Find the minimum height**: We keep track of the minimum height and the nodes that achieve this height.
5. **Return the list of all MHTs' root labels**: These are the nodes that have the minimum height when considered as the root.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
from collections import defaultdict

def find_mht_roots(n, edges):
    # Convert edges to an adjacency list
    adj_list = defaultdict(list)
    for edge in edges:

        for child in adj_list[node]:
            if child!= parent:
                height = max(height, dfs(child, node) + 1)
        heights[node] = height

CoT: To find the \(n\)-th super ugly number given an array of prime numbers, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will maintain a list of super ugly numbers and generate them in ascending order.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the list of super ugly numbers**: Start with the number 1, as it is the smallest super ugly number.
2. **Generate the next super ugly number**: For each new super ugly number, we multiply the smallest super ugly number by each prime in the array and take the smallest result that has not been seen before.
3. **Repeat until we have the \(n\)-th super ugly number**: Continue this process until we have generated \(n\) super ugly numbers.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def nth_super_ugly_number(n, primes):
    # Initialize the list of super ugly numbers with the first one
    super_ugly = [1]
    
    # Create a set to keep track of the numbers we have seen
    seen = set([1])
    
    # Generate the next super ugly number until we have n of them
    for _ in range(1, n):
        next_ugly = float('inf')
        for prime in primes:
            new_number = super_ugly[-1] * prime
            if new_number not in seen:
                next_ugly = min(next_ugly, new_number)
                seen.add(new_number)
        super_ugly.append(next_ugly)
    
    return super_ugly[-1]

# Example 1

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _**the vertical order traversal** of its nodes' values_. (i.e., from top to bottom, column by column).

If two nodes are in the same row and column, the order should be from **left to right**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[3,9,20,null,null,15,7\]
**Output:** \[\[9\],\[3,15\],\[20\],\[7\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[3,9,8,4,0,1,7\]
**Output:** \[\[4\],\[9\],\[3,0,1\],\[8\],\[7\]\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = \[3,9,8,4,0,1,7,null,null,null,2,5\]
**Output:** \[\[4\],\[9,5\],\[3,0,1\],\[8,2\],\[7\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the vertical order traversal of a binary tree, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach with a queue to keep track of the nodes and their positions. We will use a dictionary to store the nodes' values grouped by their vertical positions.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize a queue** to store the nodes and their positions. Each element in the queue will be a tuple containing the node and its vertical position.
2. ** Initialize a dictionary** to store the nodes' values grouped by their vertical positions.
3. ** Start the BFS from the root node** with a vertical position of 0.
4. ** While the queue is not empty**, do the following:
   - Pop a node and its vertical position from the queue.
   - Add the node's value to the dictionary at its vertical position.
   - Add the left child of the node to the queue with a vertical position decreased by 1.
   - Add the right child of the node to the queue with a vertical position increased by 1.
5. ** Convert the dictionary values to a list of lists** and return it.

Here is the Python code to implement the solution:
Response: python
from collections import deque

def vertical_traversal(root):
    if not root:
        return []

    queue = deque([(root, 0)])
    positions = {}

    while queue:
        node, pos = queue.pop(0)
        if pos in positions:
            positions[pos].append(node)
        else:
            positions[pos] = [node]

        if node left:
            queue.append((node left, pos - 1))
        if node right:
            queue.append((node right, pos + 1))

    result = []
    for pos in sorted(positions.keys()):
        result.append(positions[pos])

    return result

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums`, return _an integer array_ `counts` _where_ `counts[i]` _is the number of smaller elements to the right of_ `nums[i]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[5,2,6,1\]
**Output:** \[2,1,1,0\]
**Explanation:**
To the right of 5 there are **2** smaller elements (2 and 1).
To the right of 2 there is only **1** smaller element (1).
To the right of 6 there is **1** smaller element (1).
To the right of 1 there is **0** smaller element.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[-1\]
**Output:** \[0\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[-1,-1\]
**Output:** \[0,0\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of smaller elements to the right of each element in an integer array `nums`, we can use a binary search approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize an empty list `counts`** to store the result.
2. **Iterate through the array `nums` from right to left**.
3. For each element `nums[i]`, use binary search to find the number of elements in `counts` that are greater than `nums[i]`. This count will be the number of smaller elements to the right of `nums[i]`.
4. **.append** the count to `counts`.
5. **Return the list `counts`**.

Here's the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
import bisect

def count_smaller_elements(nums):
    counts = []
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
        count = bisect bisect counts, nums[i])
        counts.append(count)
    return counts

# Example usage
nums = [5, 2, 6, 1]
print(count_smaller_elements(nums))  # Output: [2, 1, 1, 0]

CoT: To solve the problem of removing duplicate letters from a string `s` so that every letter appears once and only once, and the result is the smallest in lexicographical order, we can use a set to keep track of the unique letters we have seen so far and a string to build the result. Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize an empty set `unique_letters` to store the unique letters we have seen.
2. Initialize an empty string `result` to store the final result.
3. Iterate through each character `char` in the string `s`.
4. If `char` is not in the set `unique_letters`, add it to the set and append it to the string `result`.
5. After iterating through all characters in `s`, the string `result` will contain the smallest lexicographical subsequence of distinct characters.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def smallest_subsequence(s):
    unique_letters = set()
    result = ""
    for char in s:
        if char not in unique_letters:
            unique_letters.add(char)
            result += char
    return result

# Example usage
s1 = "bcabc "
result1 = smallest_subsequence(s1)
print(result1)  # Output: "abc"

s2 = "cbacdcbc"
result2 = smallest_subsequence(s2)
print(result2)  # Output: "acdb"
