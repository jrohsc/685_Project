Original Question: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,7,11,15\], target = 9
**Output:** \[0,1\]
**Explanation:** Because nums\[0\] + nums\[1\] == 9, we return \[0, 1\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,4\], target = 6
**Output:** \[1,2\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,3\], target = 6
**Output:** \[0,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `-109 <= target <= 109`
*   **Only one valid answer exists.**

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?

CoT: To solve the problem of finding two numbers in an array that add up to a given target, we can use a two-pointer approach. This approach works by sorting the array and then using two pointers, one starting at the beginning of the array and the other at the end. We move the pointers towards each other until we find a pair of numbers that add up to the target.

Here is the Python code to implement this approach:
Response: python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    nums.sort()
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        if nums[left] + nums[right] == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif nums[left] + nums[right] < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    
    return []

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** l1 = \[2,4,3\], l2 = \[5,6,4\]
**Output:** \[7,0,8\]
**Explanation:** 342 + 465 = 807.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** l1 = \[0\], l2 = \[0\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** l1 = \[9,9,9,9,9,9,9\], l2 = \[9,9,9,9\]
**Output:** \[8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
*   It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

CoT: To solve the problem of adding two numbers represented by linked lists in Python, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert the linked lists to integers**: Since the digits are in reverse order, we can convert each linked list to an integer by iterating through the list and multiplying each digit by the appropriate power of 10.
2. **Add the integers**: Once we have the integers, we simply add them together.
3. **Convert the sum back to a linked list**: We need to convert the sum back to a linked list by repeatedly dividing the sum by 10 and storing the remainders in a new linked list.

CoT: To find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string `s`, we can use a two-pointer approach. This approach involves maintaining a sliding window that expands and contracts as we iterate through the string. We use a set to keep track of the characters in the current window and two pointers to represent the start and end of the window.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initialize two pointers, `start` and `end`, to the beginning of the string.
2. Initialize a set to store the characters in the current window.
3. Iterate through the string with the `end` pointer.
4. If the character at the `end` pointer is not in the set, add it to the set and move the `end` pointer one step to the right.
5. If the character at the `end` pointer is already in the set, remove the character at the `start` pointer from the set and move the `start` pointer one step to the right.
6. Keep track of the maximum length of the substring found so far.
7. After iterating through the entire string, return the maximum length.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def length_of_longest_substring(s):
    start = 0
    end = 0
    max_length = 0
    char_set = set()

    while end < len(s):
        if s[end] not in char_set:
            char_set.add(s[end])
            end += 1
            max_length = max(max_length, end - start)
        else:
            char_set.remove(s[start])
            start += 1

    return max_length

# Example usage
s = "abcabcbb"
print(length_of_longest_substring(s))  # Output: 3

s = "bbbbb"

Original Question: Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return **the median** of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,3\], nums2 = \[2\]

**Explanation:** merged array = \[1,2,3\] and median is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Explanation:** merged array = \[1,2,3,4\] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

**Constraints:**

*   `nums2.length == n`
*   `0 <= m <= 1000`
*   `0 <= n <= 1000`
*   `1 <= m + n <= 2000`

CoT: To find the median of two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` with a time complexity of `O(log (m+n))`, we can use a binary search approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Define the Problem:**
   - We need to find the median of the combined sorted array formed by merging `nums1` and `nums2`.
   - The median is the middle element in an odd-length array, or the average of the two middle elements in an even-length array.

2. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - We will use binary search to find the position of the median in the combined array.
   - Let's assume `m` is the length of `nums1` and `n` is the length of `nums2`.
   - The total length of the combined array is `m + n`.

3. **Finding the Median Position:**
   - If `m + n` is odd, the median position is \(\left\lfloor \frac{m + n}{2} \right\rfloor\).
   - If `m + n` is even, the median position is \(\left\lfloor \frac{m + n}{2} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m + n}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\).

4. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - We will perform a binary search on the indices of `nums1` and `nums2` to find the median.
   - At each step, we compare the elements at the current positions in `nums1` and `nums2` to determine which half of the combined array contains the median.

5. **Python Code:**
   - We will implement the binary search approach in Python.

Here's the Python code to find the median of two sorted arrays:
Response: python
def findMedian(nums1, nums2):
    m = len(nums1)
    n = len(nums2)
    total_length = m + n

    if total_length % 2 == 1:
        return findKthElement(nums1, nums2, total_length // 2)
    else:
        return (findKthElement(nums1, nums2, total_length // 2) + findKthElement(nums1, nums2, total_length // 2 + 1)) / 2

def findKthElement(nums1, nums2, k):
    if m == 0:
        return nums2[k]
    if n == 0:
        return nums1[k]
    if k == 0:
        return min(nums1[0], nums2[0])

    mid1 = k // 2
    mid2 = k - mid1

    if mid1 < m and mid2 < n:
        if nums1[mid1] < nums2[mid2]:
            return findKthElement(nums1, nums2, k - mid1)

        return findKthElement(nums1, nums2, k - mid1)
    else:
        return findKthElement(nums1, nums2, k - mid2)

CoT: To solve the problem of converting a given string `s` into a zigzag pattern with `numrows` rows and then reading it line by line, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the pattern**: The zigzag pattern alternates between moving down and up. For each row, we need to determine if it should be moving down or up.

2. **Initialize the result**: Create a list of empty strings to hold each row of the zigzag pattern.

3. **Iterate through the string**: For each character in the string, determine its position in the zigzag pattern. If the current position is in an odd row, move down. If it is in an even row, move up.

4. **Add the character to the result**: Add the current character to the appropriate row in the result list.

5. **Combine the rows**: After iterating through the entire string, combine all the rows in the result list into a single string.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:

Original Question: Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` _with its digits reversed_. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then return `0`.

**Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).**

**Example 1:**

**Input:** x = 123
**Output:** 321

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = -123
**Output:** -321

**Example 3:**

**Input:** x = 120
**Output:** 21

**Constraints:**

*   `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` _with its digits reversed_. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then return `0`. **Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).** **Example 1:** **Input:** x = 123 **Output:** 321 **Example 2:** **Input:** x = -123 **Output:** -321 **Example 3:** **Input:** x = 120 **Output:** 21 **Constraints:** * `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`
CoT: To solve the problem of reversing a signed 32-bit integer `x` without using 64-bit integers, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the sign of `x`.
2. Reverse the digits of the absolute value of `x`.
3. Apply the sign to the reversed number.
4. Check if the reversed number is within the 32-bit integer range. If it is outside the range, return 0.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
def reverse signed_int(x):
    # Determine the sign of x
    sign = -1 if x < 0 else 1
    x = abs(x)
    
    # Reverse the digits of x
    reversed_x = 0
    while x > 0:
        digit = x % 10
        reversed_x = reversed_x * 10 + digit
        x //= 10
    
    # Apply the sign to the reversed number
    reversed_x *= sign
    
    # Check if the reversed number is within the 32-bit integer range
    if reversed_x < -2**31 or reversed_x > 2**31 - 1:
        return 0
    
    return reversed_x

# Example usage
print(reverse_signed_int(123))  # Output: 321
print(reverse_signed_int(-123))  # Output: -321
print(reverse_signed_int(120))  # Output: 21
print(reverse_signed_int(1234567890))  # Output: 0 (since it exceeds the 32-bit integer range)

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
Original Question: Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1.  Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
2.  Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
3.  Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
4.  Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `"123 " -> 123`, `"0032 " -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
5.  If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.
6.  Return the integer as the final result.

**Note:**

*   Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.
*   **Do not ignore** any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "42 "
**Output:** 42
**Explanation:** The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1:  "42 " (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2:  "42 " (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3:  "42 " ( "42 " is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is 42.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "   -42 "
**Output:** -42
**Explanation:**
Step 1:  "   \-42 " (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2:  "   \-42 " ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3:  "   -42 " ( "42 " is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is -42.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "4193 with words "
**Output:** 4193
**Explanation:**
Step 1:  "4193 with words " (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2:  "4193 with words " (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3:  "4193 with words " ( "4193 " is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.
Since 4193 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is 4193.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length <= 200`
*   `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (`0-9`), `' '`, `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'.'`.

Original Question: Given an integer `x`, return `true` _if_ `x` _is a_ _**palindrome**__, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** x = 121
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = -121
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** x = 10
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Constraints:**

*   `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

CoT: To determine if an integer `x` is a palindrome without converting it to a string, we can use the following approach:

1. **Check for negative numbers and zero:**
   - If `x` is negative, it cannot be a palindrome because palindromes are read the same forwards and backwards, and a negative sign would not be read the same way.
   - If `x` is zero, it is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards.

2. **Extract the last digit and the remaining number:**
   - Use the modulo operator `%` to extract the last digit of `x`.
   - Use integer division `//` to remove the last digit from `x`.

3. **Compare the last digit with the first digit:**
   - If the last digit is not equal to the first digit, `x` is not a palindrome.
   - If the last digit is equal to the first digit, remove the first digit from `x` and repeat the process until `x` becomes zero or a negative number.

4. **Final check:**
   - If `x` becomes zero, it is a palindrome.
   - If `x` becomes a negative number, it is not a palindrome.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def is_palindrome(x):
    if x < 0:
        return False
    if x == 0:
        return True

    original_x = x
    while x > 0:
        last_digit = x % 10
        x = x // 10
        if last_digit!= original_x % 10:
            return False
        original_x = x

    return True

Original Question: Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where:

*   `'.'` Matches any single character.​​​​
*   `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "aa ", p =  "a "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:**  "a " does not match the entire string  "aa ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "aa ", p =  "a\* "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** '\*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes  "aa ".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "ab ", p =  ".\* "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**  ".\* " means  "zero or more (\*) of any character (.) ".

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= p.length <= 20`
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
*   `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'.'`, and `'*'`.
*   It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character `'*'`, there will be a previous valid character to match.

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the two lines that form a container with the maximum amount of water, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. ** Initialize Pointers:**
   - Place one pointer at the beginning of the array (left) and another at the end of the array (right).

2. ** Calculate Area:**
   - The area of the container formed by the two lines and the x-axis is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{width} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - The width is the distance between the two pointers, which is \( \text{right} - \text{left} \).
   - The height is the minimum height of the two lines at the current positions of the pointers.

3. ** Update Pointers:**
   - Move the pointer that points to the shorter line towards the other pointer. This is because moving the pointer with the higher line would not increase the height of the container and would only decrease the width.

4. ** Update Maximum Area:**
   - After each move, calculate the new area and update the maximum area found so far.

5. ** Repeat:**
   - Continue this process until the two pointers meet.

Here is the Python code implementing this algorithm:
Response: python
def max_water_container(height):
    left = 0
    right = len(height) - 1
    max_area = 0

    while left < right:
        width = right - left
        height_min = min(height[left], height[right])
        area = width * height_min
        max_area = max(max_area, area)

        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1

Original Question: Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

**Symbol**       **Value**
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

*   `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
*   `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
*   `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = 3
**Output:**  "III "
**Explanation:** 3 is represented as 3 ones.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = 58

Original Question: Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

**Symbol**       **Value**
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

*   `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
*   `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
*   `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "III "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** III = 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "LVIII "
**Output:** 58
**Explanation:** L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "MCMXCIV "
**Output:** 1994
**Explanation:** M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 15`
*   `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.
*   It is **guaranteed** that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.

CoT: To convert a Roman numeral to an integer, we need to consider the subtractive notation used in Roman numerals. We will iterate through the Roman numeral from left to right and check if the current symbol is smaller than the next symbol. If it is, we subtract its value from the next symbol's value and add the result to our total. Otherwise, we simply add the current symbol's value to our total.

Here is the Python code to achieve this:
Response: python
def roman_to_integer(s):
    roman_values = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}
    total = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if i < len(s) - 1 and roman_values[s[i]] < roman_values[s[i + 1]]:
            total += roman_values[s[i + 1]] - roman_values[s[i]]
            i += 2
        else:
            total += roman_values[s[i]]
            i += 1
    return total

Original Question: Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[-1,0,1,2,-1,-4\]
**Output:** \[\[-1,-1,2\],\[-1,0,1\]\]

nums\[0\] + nums\[1\] + nums\[2\] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding all distinct triplets in an integer array `nums` such that the sum of the triplet is zero, we can use a combination of sorting and the two-pointer technique. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Sort the array**: Sorting the array helps us to easily avoid duplicate triplets and also makes it easier to use the two-pointer technique.
2. **Iterate through the array**: We iterate through the array with a loop, and for each element `nums[i]`, we need to find two other elements `nums[j]` and `nums[k]` such that `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] = 0`. This can be rewritten as `nums[j] + nums[k] = -nums[i]`.
3. **Use two-pointers**: For each `i`, we set two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the beginning and end of the remaining part of the array (from `i+1` to the end). We then move these pointers towards each other until they meet, checking if the sum of `nums[left]` and `nums[right]` equals `-nums[i]`.
4. **Add triplets to the result**: If `nums[left] + nums[right] = -nums[i]`, we add the triplet \([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]}\) to our result. We also need to move the pointers to ensure we don't add duplicate triplets. If `nums[left] == nums[left+1]`, we move `left` to the right. Similarly, if `nums[right] == nums[right-1]`, we move `right` to the left.
5. **Continue the process**: We repeat this process until `left` and `right` meet.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:

def find三元组_sum_zero(nums):
    nums.sort()
    result = []
    n = len(nums)

            continue  # Skip duplicates
        
        left, right = i+1, n-1
        while left < right:
            if nums[left] + nums[right] == -nums[i]:
                result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])

CoT: To solve the problem of finding three integers in an array `nums` such that their sum is closest to a given `target`, we can use a combination of sorting and a two-pointer technique. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Sort the Array**: First, we sort the array `nums` in ascending order. This allows us to use the two-pointer technique effectively.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**: We iterate through the array with a loop, where the current element is `nums[i]`. For each `i`, we use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to find the two other elements that, when added to `nums[i]`, give a sum closest to `target`.

3. **Two-Pointers**: 
   - Initialize `left` to `i + 1` and `right` to `n - 1`.
   - Calculate the sum of `nums[i]`, `nums[left]`, and `nums[right]`.
   - If the sum is equal to `target`, we have found the exact sum and return it.
   - If the sum is less than `target`, we move `left` to the right to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is greater than `target`, we move `right` to the left to decrease the sum.
   - Keep track of the sum that is closest to `target` during the process.

4. **Return the Closest Sum**: After iterating through all possible combinations, we return the sum that is closest to `target`.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all unique quadruplets in an array `nums` that sum up to a given target, we can use a combination of sorting and a four-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Sort the array**: Sorting the array helps us to easily avoid duplicate quadruplets and to use the four-pointer approach efficiently.

2. **Use four pointers**: We will use four pointers, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, to find the quadruplets. We start with `a` at the beginning of the array, `b` at `a+1`, `c` at `b+1`, and `d` at `c+1`. We will move these pointers based on the sum of the elements they point to.

3. **Check the sum**: If the sum of the elements at the four pointers is equal to the target, we add the quadruplet to our result list. If the sum is less than the target, we move `d` to the right (increase `d`). If the sum is greater than the target, we move `c` to the right (increase `c`).

4. **Avoid duplicates**: To avoid duplicate quadruplets, we need to ensure that we do not add the same quadruplet more than once. We do this by checking if the current quadruplet is the same as the previous one before adding it to the result list. We also move the pointers after adding a quadruplet to avoid considering the same elements again.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
def find_quadruplets(nums, target):
    n = len(nums)
    result = []
    nums.sort()
    
    for a in range(n):
        if a > 0 and nums[a] == nums[a-1]:
            continue
        for b in range(a+1, n):
            if b > a+1 and nums[b] == nums[b-1]:
                continue
            for c in range(b+1, n):
                if c > b+1 and nums[c] == nums[c-1]:
                    continue
                d = c+1
                while d < n:
                    if nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d] == target:
                        result.append([nums[a], nums[b], nums[c], nums[d]])
                        d += 1
                    elif nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d] < target:
                        d += 1
                    else:

CoT: To solve the problem of removing the `nth` node from the end of a linked list, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: Create two pointers, `first` and `second`, both starting at the head of the list.
2. **Move the First Pointers**: Move the `first` pointer `n` steps forward. This ensures that when the `second` pointer reaches the end of the list, the `first` pointer will be at the `n`th node from the end.
3. **Move the Second Pointers**: Move both the `first` and `second` pointers together until the `second` pointer reaches the end of the list. This means the `first` pointer will be at the `n`th node from the end.
4. **Remove the Node**: Once the `second` pointer reaches the end, remove the node pointed to by the `first` pointer.
5. **Return the Head**: Return the head of the list.

Original Question: Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1.  Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2.  Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3.  Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "() "

**Input:** s =  "()\[\]{} "
**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "(\] "
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 104`
*   `s` consists of parentheses only `'()[]{}'`.

CoT: To determine if a given string `s` is valid, we can use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. For each opening bracket encountered, we push it onto the stack. For each closing bracket encountered, we check if the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket. If either condition is true, the string is not valid. If we finish iterating through the string and the stack is empty, the string is valid.

CoT: To merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted list, we can use a two-pointer approach. We'll iterate through both lists, comparing the values of the nodes at the current positions of the two pointers.

CoT: To merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list, we can use a min-heap (or a priority queue) to keep track of the smallest elements from each list. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize a min-heap**: We will use a min-heap to store the smallest elements from each list. The key of each element in the heap will be the value of the element itself, and the data will be a tuple containing the element, the index of the list it comes from, and the index of the next element in that list.

2. **Add the first elements of each list to the min-heap**: We start by adding the first element of each list to the min-heap. If a list is empty, we do not add anything to the heap.

3. ** extract the minimum element and add the next element**: We repeatedly extract the minimum element from the heap and add the next element from the list it came from to the heap. This process continues until the heap is empty.

4. **Construct the result list**: As we extract the minimum elements from the heap, we add them to a new list in order. This new list will be the sorted合并 list.

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**. Then return _the number of unique elements in_ `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

*   Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
*   Return `k`.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array
int\[\] expectedNums = \[...\]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums\[i\] == expectedNums\[i\];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,2\]
**Output:** 2, nums = \[1,2,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4\]
**Output:** 5, nums = \[0,1,2,3,4,\_,\_,\_,\_,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
*   `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

CoT: To solve the problem of removing duplicates from a sorted array in place and returning the number of unique elements, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers, `i` and `j`, both initially pointing to the first element of the array `nums`.
2. **Iterate Through the Array**: Iterate through the array with the pointer `j` starting from the second element.
3. **Compare Elements**: For each element at position `j`, compare it with the element at position `i`.
4. **Move Pointers**: If the element at `j` is different from the element at `i`, it means we have found a new unique element. Move the pointer `i` one step to the right and set the value at position `i` to the value at position `j`.
5. **Continue Iterating**: Continue this process until `j` reaches the end of the array.
6. **Return the Result**: The value of `i` at the end of the iteration will be the number of unique elements in the array. Return `i + 1` (since `i` is zero-indexed).

Here's the Python code implementing the above steps:
Response: python
def remove duplicates(nums):
    i = 0
    for j in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[j]!= nums[i]:
            i += 1
            nums[i] = nums[j]
    return i + 1

# Example usage
nums1 = [1, 1, 2]
k1 = remove duplicates(nums1)
print(k1)  # Output: 2

nums2 = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
k2 = remove duplicates(nums2)
print(k2)  # Output: 5

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm). The order of the elements may be changed. Then return _the number of elements in_ `nums` _which are not equal to_ `val`.

Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

*   Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int\[\] expectedNums = \[...\]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

Original Question: Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** haystack =  "sadbutsad ", needle =  "sad "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:**  "sad " occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**  "leeto " did not occur in  "leetcode ", so we return -1.

**Constraints:**

*   `haystack` and `needle` consist of only lowercase English characters.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the index of the first occurrence of a needle in a haystack, we can use Python's built-in `str.index()` method. This method returns the index of the first occurrence of a given substring in a string. If the substring is not found, it returns -1.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Define the function `find_first_occurrence` that takes two parameters: `haystack` and `needle`.
2. Use the `str.index()` method to find the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`.
3. If the method returns a value, that value is the index of the first occurrence. If it returns -1, then `needle` is not part of `haystack`.
4. Return the result.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def find_first_occurrence(haystack, needle):
    index = haystack.index(needle)
    return index

# Example 1
haystack1 = "sadyutsad"
needle1 = "sad"
result1 = find_first_occurrence(haystack1, needle1)
print(result1)  # Output: 0

Original Question: Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide two integers **without** using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, `8.345` would be truncated to `8`, and `-2.7335` would be truncated to `-2`.

Return _the **quotient** after dividing_ `dividend` _by_ `divisor`.

**Note:** Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the **32-bit** signed integer range: `[-231, 231 - 1]`. For this problem, if the quotient is **strictly greater than** `231 - 1`, then return `231 - 1`, and if the quotient is **strictly less than** `-231`, then return `-231`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** dividend = 10, divisor = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 10/3 = 3.33333.. which is truncated to 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** dividend = 7, divisor = -3
**Output:** -2
**Explanation:** 7/-3 = -2.33333.. which is truncated to -2.

**Constraints:**

CoT: To solve the problem of dividing two integers without using multiplication, division, or mod operators, we can use a method that involves repeated subtraction. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine the sign of the quotient:**
   - If both `dividend` and `divisor` have the same sign (both positive or both negative), the quotient will be positive.
   - If `dividend` and `divisor` have different signs, the quotient will be negative.

2. **Convert the integers to their absolute values:**
   - This allows us to work with positive numbers, simplifying the subtraction process.

3. **Perform repeated subtraction:**
   - Subtract the absolute value of the `divisor` from the absolute value of the `dividend` until the absolute value of the `dividend` is less than the absolute value of the `divisor`.
   - Count the number of subtractions performed. This count will be the absolute value of the quotient.

4. **Adjust the sign of the quotient:**
   - If the quotient should be negative, negate the count.

5. **Check for overflow:**
   - If the quotient is greater than `231 - 1` or less than `-231`, return the appropriate boundary value.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def integer_division(dividend, divisor):
    # Determine the sign of the quotient
    sign = -1 if (dividend < 0)!= (divisor < 0) else 1

    # Convert the integers to their absolute values
    dividend_abs = abs(dividend)
    divisor_abs = abs(divisor)

    # Perform repeated subtraction
    quotient_abs = 0
    while dividend_abs >= divisor_abs:
        dividend_abs -= divisor_abs
        quotient_abs += 1

    # Adjust the sign of the quotient
    quotient = sign * quotient_abs

Original Question: You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of `words` are of **the same length**.

A **concatenated substring** in `s` is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of `words` concatenated.

*   For example, if `words = [ "ab ", "cd ", "ef "]`, then `"abcdef "`, `"abefcd "`, `"cdabef "`, `"cdefab "`, `"efabcd "`, and `"efcdab "` are all concatenated strings. `"acdbef "` is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of `words`.

Return _the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in_ `s`. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "barfoothefoobarman ", words = \[ "foo ", "bar "\]
**Output:** \[0,9\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 2 and words\[i\].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.
The substring starting at 0 is  "barfoo ". It is the concatenation of \[ "bar ", "foo "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is  "foobar ". It is the concatenation of \[ "foo ", "bar "\] which is a permutation of words.
The output order does not matter. Returning \[9,0\] is fine too.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword ", words = \[ "word ", "good ", "best ", "word "\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 4 and words\[i\].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.
There is no substring of length 16 is s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.
We return an empty array.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "barfoofoobarthefoobarman ", words = \[ "bar ", "foo ", "the "\]
**Output:** \[6,9,12\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 3 and words\[i\].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 9.
The substring starting at 6 is  "foobarthe ". It is the concatenation of \[ "foo ", "bar ", "the "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is  "barthefoo ". It is the concatenation of \[ "bar ", "the ", "foo "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 12 is  "thefoobar ". It is the concatenation of \[ "the ", "foo ", "bar "\] which is a permutation of words.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 104`
*   `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the starting indices of all concatenated substrings in a given string `s` that are formed by permutations of a given array of strings `words`, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of the concatenated substring:**
   Since all strings in `words` are of the same length, let `word_length` be the length of each string in `words`. The length of the concatenated substring will be `word_length * words_length`.

2. **Create a frequency map for the concatenated string:**
   We need to create a frequency map for the concatenated string formed by any permutation of `words`. This frequency map will count the occurrences of each character in the concatenated string.

3. **sliding window approach:**
   We will use a sliding window approach to check each substring of `s` of length `word_length * words_length` to see if it matches the frequency map of the concatenated string.

4. **Check the frequency map of the current substring:**
   For each substring, we will create its frequency map and compare it with the frequency map of the concatenated string. If the frequency maps are identical, then the substring is a concatenated substring.

5. **Collect the starting indices:**
   If a substring is a concatenated substring, we will add its starting index to the result list.

Here is the Python code that implements the above steps:
Response: python

def find_concatenated_substrings(s, words):

Original Question: A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

*   For example, for `arr = [1,2,3]`, the following are all the permutations of `arr`: `[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]`.

The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

*   For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.
*   Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.
*   While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers `nums`, _find the next permutation of_ `nums`.

The replacement must be **[in place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** and use only constant extra memory.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** \[1,3,2\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,1\]
**Output:** \[1,2,3\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,5\]

CoT: To find the next permutation of an array of integers in place and using only constant extra memory, we can follow these steps:

1. **Find the first element from the right that is smaller than its next element.** This element is the pivot.
2. **Find the smallest element to the right of the pivot that is greater than the pivot.** Swap this element with the pivot.
3. **Reverse the segment of the array to the right of the pivot.**

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def next_permutation(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Step 1: Find the pivot
    pivot = n - 2
    while pivot >= 0 and nums[pivot] >= nums[pivot + 1]:
        pivot -= 1
    
    # If no pivot is found, the array is already in descending order
    if pivot == -1:
        nums.reverse()
        return
    
    # Step 2: Find the smallest element to the right of the pivot that is greater than the pivot
    next_greater = n - 1
    while nums[next_greater] <= nums[pivot]:
        next_greater -= 1
    
    # Swap the pivot with the next greater element
    nums[pivot], nums[next_greater] = nums[next_greater], nums[pivot]
    
    # Step 3: Reverse the segment of the array to the right of the pivot
    nums[pivot + 1:] = nums[pivot + 1:][::-1]

Original Question: Given a string containing just the characters `'('` and `')'`, return _the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses_ _substring_.

*   `0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `s[i]` is `'('`, or `')'`.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the length of the longest valid parentheses substring in a given string containing only the characters `('` and `')`, we can use a stack to keep track of the positions of the parentheses. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a stack and a variable `max_length` to keep track of the maximum length of a valid parentheses substring.
2. Iterate through the string from left to right.
3. If the current character is `('`, push its index onto the stack.
4. If the current character is `')`, pop the top of the stack. If the stack is empty, this means we have a valid parentheses substring that starts at the current position. If the stack is not empty, this means we have a valid parentheses substring that ends at the current position. In both cases, update the `max_length` if the current substring is longer than the previous maximum.
5. After iterating through the string, return the `max_length`.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def longest_valid_parentheses(s):
    stack = []
    max_length = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':

                stack.pop()
                if not stack:

                else:

Original Question: There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return _the index of_ `target` _if it is in_ `nums`_, or_ `-1` _if it is not in_ `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,6,7,0,1,2\], target = 0
**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,6,7,0,1,2\], target = 3
**Output:** -1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1\], target = 0
**Output:** -1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
*   All values of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
*   `-104 <= target <= 104`

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a modified binary search algorithm. The key observation is that after a rotation, the array can be divided into two parts: one part is sorted in ascending order, and the other part is also sorted in ascending order. We can use this property to find the target value in the array.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Find the pivot index**: The pivot index is the index where the array is rotated. We can use binary search to find the pivot index. The pivot index is the index where `nums[i] > nums[i+1]`.

2. **Perform binary search**: Once we have the pivot index, we can perform binary search in the appropriate part of the array. If the target value is less than or equal to the last element of the array, we search in the first part of the array (from the beginning to the pivot index). If the target value is greater than the last element of the array, we search in the second part of the array (from the pivot index to the end).

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def find_pivot_index(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]:
            return mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left

def binary_search(nums, target, left, right):
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1

def search_in_rotated_array(nums, target):
    pivot_index = find_pivot_index(nums)
    if target <= nums[-1]:
        return binary_search(nums, target, 0, pivot_index)
    else:
        return binary_search(nums, target, pivot_index + 1, len(nums) - 1)

# Example usage

If the value of the target is greater than the middle element, the search interval is reduced to the right half.

CoT: To determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid, we need to check three conditions for each row, column, and `3 x 3` sub-box:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

We will implement a function to check these conditions step by step.

CoT: To solve the Sudoku puzzle, we can use a backtracking algorithm. The algorithm works by iterating through each cell in the grid and trying to fill it with a digit from 1 to 9. If a digit can be placed in a cell without violating the Sudoku rules, the algorithm moves to the next cell. If a digit cannot be placed in a cell, the algorithm backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different digit. This process continues until the entire grid is filled.

Original Question: The **count-and-say** sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

*   `countAndSay(1) = "1 "`
*   `countAndSay(n)` is the way you would "say " the digit string from `countAndSay(n-1)`, which is then converted into a different digit string.

To determine how you "say " a digit string, split it into the **minimal** number of substrings such that each substring contains exactly **one** unique digit. Then for each substring, say the number of digits, then say the digit. Finally, concatenate every said digit.

For example, the saying and conversion for digit string `"3322251 "`:

Given a positive integer `n`, return _the_ `nth` _term of the **count-and-say** sequence_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:**  "1 "
**Explanation:** This is the base case.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 4
**Output:**  "1211 "

countAndSay(1) =  "1 "
countAndSay(2) = say  "1 " = one 1 =  "11 "
countAndSay(3) = say  "11 " = two 1's =  "21 "

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the `n`th term of the **count-and-say** sequence, we can use a recursive approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Base Case**: If `n` is 1, return "1".
2. **Recursive Step**: For `n > 1`, we need to generate the `n`th term by "saying" the `(n-1)`th term. To "say" a digit string, we iterate through it and count the number of consecutive digits. For each count, we append the count and the digit to the result.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def count_and_say(n):
    if n == 1:
        return "1"
    else:
        previous_term = count_and_say(n-1)
        result = ""
        count = 1

Original Question: Given an array of **distinct** integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return _a list of all **unique combinations** of_ `candidates` _where the chosen numbers sum to_ `target`_._ You may return the combinations in **any order**.

The **same** number may be chosen from `candidates` an **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** candidates = \[2,3,6,7\], target = 7
**Output:** \[\[2,2,3\],\[7\]\]
**Explanation:**
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.

**Example 2:**

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to find all unique combinations of the given `candidates` that sum up to the `target`. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Define the recursive function**: We'll create a function `find_combinations` that takes the current `candidates`, the current `target`, the current `combination`, and the index of the current candidate in the `candidates` array.

2. **Base cases**:
   - If the current `target` is 0, we have found a valid combination. Add the current `combination` to the result.
   - If the current `target` is less than 0 or the current index is greater than or equal to the length of the `candidates` array, we have no valid combination. Return an empty list.

3. **Recursive cases**:
   - Include the current candidate in the combination and recursively call `find_combinations` with the updated `target` ( subtract the current candidate), the updated `combination` (add the current candidate), and the same index (since we can use the same candidate multiple times).
   - Exclude the current candidate from the combination and recursively call `find_combinations` with the same `target`, the updated `combination` (do not add the current candidate), and the next index (move to the next candidate).

4. **Combine the results**: The result of the recursive function will be a list of all unique combinations that sum up to the `target`.

Here's the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
def find_combinations(candidates, target, combination, index):
    if target == 0:
        return [combination]
    if target < 0 or index >= len(candidates):
        return []
    
    # Include the current candidate
    include = find_combinations(candidates, target - candidates[index], combination + [candidates[index]], index)
    
    # Exclude the current candidate
    exclude = find_combinations(candidates, target, combination, index + 1)
    
    # Combine the results
    result = include + exclude
    return result

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach. We will iterate through the `candidates` list and for each number, we will check if it can be included in the current combination. If it can, we will add it to the current combination and recursively call the function with the updated combination and the remaining target. After the recursive call, we will remove the number from the current combination to backtrack. We will also ensure that we do not add duplicate combinations by sorting the `candidates` list and only considering each number once in the current combination.

def find_combinations(candidates, target):
    candidates.sort()

Original Question: Given an unsorted integer array `nums`, return the smallest missing positive integer.

You must implement an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,0\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The numbers in the range \[1,2\] are all in the array.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,4,-1,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 1 is in the array but 2 is missing.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[7,8,9,11,12\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The smallest positive integer 1 is missing.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given an unsorted integer array `nums`, return the smallest missing positive integer.

CoT: To find the smallest missing positive integer in an unsorted integer array `nums` in `O(n)` time and using constant extra space, we can use the following algorithm:

1. **Initialize a set to store positive integers from the array.**
2. **Iterate through the array and add all positive integers to the set.**
3. **Iterate through the set starting from 1 and find the first integer that is not in the set.**

Original Question: Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** height = \[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array \[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1\]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** height = \[4,2,0,3,2,5\]
**Output:** 9

**Constraints:**

*   `n == height.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
*   `0 <= height[i] <= 105`
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining. **Example 1:** **Input:** height = \[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1\] **Output:** 6 **Explanation:** The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array \[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1\].

CoT: To solve the problem of computing how much water it can trap after raining on an elevation map, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. ** Initialize Pointers:**
   - Set two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the beginning and end of the array respectively.
   - Initialize two variables, `max_left` and `max_right`, to keep track of the maximum height to the left and right of the current position.

2. ** Iterate Between Pointers:**
   - While `left` is less than `right`, do the following:
     - Update `max_left` to be the maximum of `max_left` and `height[left]`.
     - Update `max_right` to be the maximum of `max_right` and `height[right]`.
     - If `height[left]` is less than `height[right]`, add the difference between `max_left` and `height[left]` to the total water trapped, and increment `left`.
     - Otherwise, add the difference between `max_right` and `height[right]` to the total water trapped, and decrement `right`.

3. ** Return Total Water Trapped:**
   - After the loop ends, return the total water trapped.

Here's the Python code implementing this algorithm:
Response: python
def trap_water(height):
    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    max_left, max_right = 0, 0
    total_water_trapped = 0

    while left < right:
        max_left = max(max_left, height[left])
        max_right = max(max_right, height[right])
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            total_water_trapped += max_left - height[left]
            left += 1
        else:
            total_water_trapped += max_right - height[right]
            right -= 1

    return total_water_trapped

# Example 1
height1 = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
print(trap_water(height1))  # Output: 6

# Example 2
height2 = [4, 2, 0, 3, 2, 5]

Original Question: Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as strings, return the product of `num1` and `num2`, also represented as a string.

**Note:** You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
**Output:** "6"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
**Output:** "56088"

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200`
*   `num1` and `num2` consist of digits only.
*   Both `num1` and `num2` do not contain any leading zero, except the number `0` itself.

CoT: To solve the problem of multiplying two non-negative integers represented as strings without using any built-inBigInteger library or converting the inputs to integer directly, we can use a manual multiplication algorithm similar to how we do it by hand. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize the result**: Start with an empty string to store the final product.
2. **Multiply each digit**: For each digit in `num2` from right to left, multiply it by each digit in `num1` from right to left, and keep track of the carry.
3. **Add the partial products**: After multiplying all the digits, add up all the partial products to get the final result.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
def multiply(num1, num2):
    # Initialize the result
    result = ""
    
    # Reverse the strings to make the multiplication easier
    num1 = num1[::-1]
    num2 = num2[::-1]
    
    # Multiply each digit in num2 by each digit in num1
    for i in range(len(num2)):
        partial_product = ""
        carry = 0
        for j in range(len(num1)):
            # Multiply the current digits and add the carry
            product = int(num1[j]) * int(num2[i]) + carry
            # Append the digit part of the product to the partial product
            partial_product += str(product % 10)
            # Update the carry
            carry = product // 10
        # If there is a carry left, append it to the partial product
        if carry > 0:
            partial_product += str(carry)
        # Add the partial product to the result
        result = partial_product + result
    
    return result

# Example usage
num1 = "2"
num2 = "3"
print(multiply(num1, num2))  # Output: "6"

num1 = "123"
num2 = "456"
print(multiply(num1, num2))  # Output: "56088"

Original Question: Given an input string (`s`) and a pattern (`p`), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for `'?'` and `'*'` where:

*   `'?'` Matches any single character.
*   `'*'` Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "aa ", p =  "a "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:**  "a " does not match the entire string  "aa ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "aa ", p =  "\* "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** '\*' matches any sequence.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "cb ", p =  "?a "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** '?' matches 'c', but the second letter is 'a', which does not match 'b'.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length, p.length <= 2000`
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
*   `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'?'` or `'*'`.

CoT: To solve the problem of implementing wildcard pattern matching with support for `?` and `*` where `?` matches any single character and `*` matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence), we can use a dynamic programming approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize a 2D DP Table:**
   - Create a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the first `i` characters of the string `s` match the first `j` characters of the pattern `p`, and `False` otherwise.
   - Initialize `dp[0][0]` to `True` because an empty pattern matches an empty string.

2. ** handled the first row and first column:**
   - For `j > 0`, `dp[0][j]` is `True` if `p[j-1]` is `*` and `dp[0][j-1]` is `True`. This is because `*` can match any sequence, including the empty sequence.
   - For `i > 0`, `dp[i][0]` is `False` because `s[i-1]` cannot match an empty pattern.

3. **Fill the DP Table:**
   - For `i > 0` and `j > 0`, there are three cases to consider:
     - If `p[j-1]` is a letter (not `?` or `*`), `dp[i][j]` is `True` if `dp[i-1][j-1]` is `True` and `s[i-1]` matches `p[j-1]`.
     - If `p[j-1]` is `?`, `dp[i][j]` is `True` if `dp[i-1][j-1]` is `True` because `?` can match any single character.
     - If `p[j-1]` is `*`, `dp[i][j]` is `True` if `dp[i][j-1]` is `True` or if `dp[i-1][j]` is `True`. This is because `*` can match any sequence, including the empty sequence.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - The final answer is `dp[s_length][p_length]`, which indicates whether the entire string `s` matches the entire pattern `p`.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def is_match(s, p):
    s_length, p_length = len(s), len(p)
    dp = [[False] * (p_length + 1) for _ in range(s_length + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = True

    for j in range(1, p_length + 1):
        if p[j-1] == '*':
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1]

    for i in range(1, s_length + 1):
        for j in range(1, p_length + 1):
            if p[j-1] == s[i-1] or p[j-1] == '?':
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
            elif p[j-1] == '*':
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] or dp[i-1][j]

    return dp[s_length][p_length]

# Example usage
s = "aa"
p = "a"
print(is_match(s, p))  # Output: False

s = "aa"
p = "*"
print(is_match(s, p))  # Output: True

s = "cb"
p = "?a"
print(is_match(s, p))  # Output: False

Original Question: You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at `nums[0]`.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index `i`. In other words, if you are at `nums[i]`, you can jump to any `nums[i + j]` where:

*   `0 <= j <= nums[i]` and
*   `i + j < n`

Return _the minimum number of jumps to reach_ `nums[n - 1]`. The test cases are generated such that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,1,1,4\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,0,1,4\]
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
*   It's guaranteed that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will keep track of the farthest we can reach from the current position and update it as we iterate through the array. We will also keep track of the number of jumps we have made.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Initialize the current position `current_pos` to 0.
2. Initialize the farthest we can reach `farthest` to `nums[0]`.
3. Initialize the number of jumps `jumps` to 0.
4. Iterate through the array from index 1 to `n-1`.
5. For each index `i`, update `farthest` to the maximum of `farthest` and `current_pos + nums[i]`.
6. If `i` is equal to `current_pos`, increment `jumps` by 1 and update `current_pos` to `farthest`.
7. After the loop, return the number of jumps.

Here is the Python code implementing this algorithm:
Response: python
def min_jumps(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    current_pos = 0
    farthest = nums[0]
    jumps = 0

**Input:** matrix = \[\[5,1,9,11\],\[2,4,8,10\],\[13,3,6,7\],\[15,14,12,16\]\]
**Output:** \[\[15,13,2,5\],\[14,3,4,1\],\[12,6,8,9\],\[16,7,10,11\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length`
*   `1 <= n <= 20`
*   `-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000`
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, You are given an `n x n` 2D `matrix` representing an image, rotate the image by **90** degrees (clockwise). You have to rotate the image [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm), which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. **DO NOT** allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation. **Example 1:** **Input:** matrix = \[\[1,2,3\],\[4,5,6\],\[7,8,9\]\] **Output:** \[\[7,4,1\],\[8,5,2\],\[9,6,3\]\] **Example 2:** **Input:** matrix = \[\[5,1,9,11\],\[2,4,8,10\],\[13,3,6,7\],\[15,14,12,16\]\] **Output:** \[\[15,13,2,5\],\[14,3,4,1\],\[12,6,8,9\],\[16,7,10,11\]\] **Constraints:** * `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length` * `1 <= n <= 20` * `-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000`
CoT: To rotate an `n x n` 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise in place, we can follow these steps:

1. ** Transpose the matrix**: Swap each element `matrix[i][j]` with `matrix[j][i]`. This operation will flip the matrix along its main diagonal.
2. ** Reverse each row**: For each row, reverse the order of its elements. This operation will flip each row vertically.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def rotate_matrix(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    
    # Step 1: Transpose the matrix
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
    
    # Step 2: Reverse each row
    for i in range(n):
        matrix[i] = matrix[i][::-1]
    
    return matrix

# Example usage
matrix1 = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
print(rotate_matrix(matrix1))
# Output: [[7, 4, 1], [8, 5, 2], [9, 6, 3]]

matrix2 = [[5, 1, 9, 11], [2, 4, 8, 10], [13, 3, 6, 7], [15, 14, 12, 16]]
print(rotate_matrix(matrix2))
# Output: [[15, 13, 2, 5], [14, 3, 4, 1], [12, 6, 8, 9], [16, 7, 10, 11]]

Original Question: Given an array of strings `strs`, group **the anagrams** together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strs = \["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"\]
**Output:** \[\["bat"\],\["nat","tan"\],\["ate","eat","tea"\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strs = \[""\]
**Output:** \[\[""\]\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** strs = \["a"\]
**Output:** \[\["a"\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= strs.length <= 104`
*   `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
*   `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

CoT: To solve the problem of grouping anagrams together in Python, we can use a dictionary where the key is a sorted tuple of the characters in a word, and the value is a list of words that have that sorted tuple. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Create an empty dictionary `anagrams` to store the groups of anagrams.
2. Iterate through each word `word` in the input list `strs`.
3. Sort the characters in `word` to form a key.
4. If the key is already in the dictionary, append `word` to the list of words already associated with that key.
5. If the key is not in the dictionary, create a new key with the sorted characters and assign it a new list containing `word`.
6. After iterating through all the words, return the values of the dictionary as a list of lists.

Here's the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
from collections import defaultdict

def group_anagrams(strs):
    anagrams = defaultdict(list)
    for word in strs:
        key = tuple(sorted(word))
        anagrams[key].append(word)
    return list(anagrams.values())

# Example usage
strs1 = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
print(group_anagrams(strs1))
# Output: [['bat'], ['nat', 'tan'], ['ate', 'eat', 'tea']]

strs2 = [""]
print(group_anagrams(strs2))
# Output: [['']]

strs3 = ["a"]
print(group_anagrams(strs3))
# Output: [['a']]

CoT: To solve the **n-queens** puzzle, we can use a backtracking algorithm. Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, incrementally building candidates to the solutions and **abstaining** a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be extended to a valid solution.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize an `n x n` chessboard** with all empty spaces represented by ` '.'`.
2. **Define a function `is_safe`** to check if it is safe to place a queen in a given row and column. A queen is safe if there are no other queens in the same row, column, or diagonal.
3. **Define a function `solve_n_queens`** to solve the puzzle using backtracking. This function will iterate through each row and try to place a queen in each column of that row. If it is safe to place a queen, it will mark that cell as occupied by a queen and move to the next row. If it reaches the last row and places a queen in the last row, it has found a solution. If it cannot place a queen in any column of the current row, it will backtrack to the previous row and try to place a queen in a different column of that row.
4. **Define a function `print_solution`** to print the current state of the chessboard as a 2D list.

Here is the Python code to implement the algorithm:
Response: python
def is_safe(board, row, col, n):
    # Check row
    for i in range(col):
        if board[row][i] == 'Q':

    # Check column

            return False

    # Check diagonals
    for i in range(row - col, -1, -1):
        if board[i][col + i] == 'Q':
            return False
    for i in range(row + col, n):
        if board[i][n - 1 - (i - row)] == 'Q':
            return False

    # Base case: If all queens are placed

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, incrementally building candidates to the solutions and abandoning a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be extended to a valid solution.

Here is the step-by-step Python code to solve the problem:

1. **Define the function to check if a queen can be placed at a given position.**
   - The function `is_safe` checks if a queen can be placed at row `row` and column `col` without attacking any other queens already placed on the board.
   - It checks the left vertical, upper left diagonal, and upper right diagonal.

2. **Define the backtracking function to find all solutions.**
   - The function `solve_n_queens` uses recursion to place queens row by row.
   - For each row, it tries to place a queen in each column.
   - If a queen can be placed at a given position, it marks that position as occupied and moves to the next row.
   - If it reaches the last row, it has found a solution and increments the count of solutions.
   - If it cannot place a queen in any column of the current row, it backtracks to the previous row and tries to place the queen in a different column.

3. **Define the main function to solve the n-queens problem.**
   - The function `n_queens` takes an integer `n` as input and calls the `solve_n_queens` function with initial values.
   - It returns the count of distinct solutions.

Here is the Python code:
Response: python

            board[i][col] = 1

            # Move to the next column
            count += solve_n_queens(board, col + 1, n)

            # Backtrack: Remove the queen from board[i][col]

*   `1 <= m, n <= 10`
*   `-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100`

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all elements of an `m x n` matrix in spiral order, we can use a systematic approach that iteratively solves the problem by reducing the size of the matrix in each iteration. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize the boundaries**: Define four variables to keep track of the boundaries of the current spiral: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`. Initially, `top` is 0, `bottom` is `m-1`, `left` is 0, and `right` is `n-1`.

2. **Iterate over the matrix**: While `top` is less than or equal to `bottom` and `left` is less than or equal to `right`, perform the following steps:
   - **Move right**: Iterate from `left` to `right` and add the elements to the result list.
   - **Move down**: Iterate from `top` to `bottom` and add the elements to the result list.
   - **Move left**: If `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`, iterate from `right` to `left` and add the elements to the result list.
   - **Move up**: If `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`, iterate from `bottom` to `top` and add the elements to the result list.
   - **Update the boundaries**: After each iteration, update the boundaries by incrementing `top` and `bottom` by 1, and decrementing `left` and `right` by 1.

3. **Return the result**: Once the loop exits, the result list will contain all elements of the matrix in spiral order. Return the result list.

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def spiral order(matrix):
    result = []

Original Question: You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` _if you can reach the last index, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,1,1,4\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,1,0,4\]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`

CoT: To determine if it is possible to reach the last index of the given integer array `nums`, we can use a greedy approach. We start at the first index and keep track of the maximum index we can reach from our current position. As we iterate through the array, we update this maximum reach based on the current element's value and our current position. If at any point our maximum reach is less than or equal to the last index of the array, we conclude that it is impossible to reach the last index.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def can_reach_last_index(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    max_reach = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if i > max_reach:
            return False

        if max_reach >= n - 1:
            return True

# Example 1
nums1 = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]

Original Question: Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return _an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = \[\[1,3\],\[2,6\],\[8,10\],\[15,18\]\]
**Output:** \[\[1,6\],\[8,10\],\[15,18\]\]

*   `intervals[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= starti <= endi <= 104`

CoT: To solve the problem of merging overlapping intervals, we can follow these steps:

1. **Sort the Intervals**: Sort the intervals based on their start times. This ensures that we can process the intervals in a sequential manner.
2. **Initialize the Result**: Start with an empty list to store the result.
3. **Iterate Through the Intervals**: For each interval in the sorted list, check if it overlaps with the last interval in the result list.
   - If it does overlap, update the end time of the last interval in the result list to the maximum of the current interval's end time and the last interval's end time.
   - If it does not overlap, add the current interval to the result list.
4. **Return the Result**: After processing all intervals, return the result list.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:

def merge_intervals(intervals):
    # Step 1: Sort the intervals based on their start times

Original Question: You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the `ith` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` _after the insertion_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = \[\[1,3\],\[6,9\]\], newInterval = \[2,5\]

2. **Check for overlaps**: We need to check if the new interval overlaps with any of the existing intervals. If it does, we need to merge the new interval with the overlapping intervals.
3. **Insert the new interval**: Once we have the correct position and have handled any overlaps, we can insert the new interval into the list.

CoT: To solve the problem of rotating a linked list to the right by \( k \) places, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the effective rotation**: Since the list is circular, rotating by \( k \) places is equivalent to rotating by \( k \mod n \) places, where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the list. This ensures that we don't perform more rotations than necessary.

2. **Find the new head and tail**: After determining the effective rotation, we need to find the new head and tail of the list. The new head will be the node that is \( n - k \mod n \) places from the original head. The new tail will be the node that is \( k \mod n \) places from the original head.

3. **Set up the new list**: Once we have the new head and tail, we can set up the new list by connecting the new head to the original tail and making the new tail the new head.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`. **Example 1:** **Input:** m = 3, n = 7 **Output:** 28 **Example 2:** **Input:** m = 3, n = 2 **Output:** 3 **Explanation:** From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner: 1. Right -> Down -> Down 2. Down -> Down -> Right 3. Down -> Right -> Down **Constraints:** * `1 <= m, n <= 100`
CoT: To determine the number of unique paths a robot can take from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an `m x n` grid, we can use a combinatorial approach. The robot needs to make exactly `m-1` moves down and `n-1` moves right to reach the bottom-right corner. The total number of moves is `m-1 + n-1 = m+n-2`, and we need to choose `m-1` of these moves to be down (or equivalently, `n-1` moves to be right). This is a classic combination problem, which can be solved using the binomial coefficient:

\[
\text{Number of unique paths} = \binom{m+n-2}{m-1} = \frac{(m+n-2)!}{(m-1)!(n-1)!}
\]

We will use Python's `math.comb` function to compute the binomial coefficient. Here is the Python code to solve the problem:
Response: python
import math

def unique_paths(m, n):
    return math.comb(m+n-2, m-1)

# Example 1
m1, n1 = 3, 7
print(unique_paths(m1, n1))  # Output: 28

# Example 2
m2, n2 = 3, 2
print(unique_paths(m2, n2))  # Output: 3

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
Original Question: You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid`. There is a robot initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as `1` or `0` respectively in `grid`. A path that the robot takes cannot include **any** square that is an obstacle.

Return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** obstacleGrid = \[\[0,0,0\],\[0,1,0\],\[0,0,0\]\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right

**Example 2:**

**Input:** obstacleGrid = \[\[0,1\],\[0,0\]\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `m == obstacleGrid.length`
*   `n == obstacleGrid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 100`
*   `obstacleGrid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid`. There is a robot initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`).

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to reach the cell `(i, j)` from the top-left corner `(0, 0)`. The robot can only move down or right, so we can fill in the `dp` array as follows:

1. Initialize `dp[0][0]` to 1 because there is exactly one way to be at the starting point.
2. For each cell `(i, j)`, if it is an obstacle (i.e., `obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1`), then `dp[i][j]` is 0 because the robot cannot pass through this cell.
3. If the cell is not an obstacle, then `dp[i][j]` is the sum of the number of ways to reach the cell above it (`dp[i-1][j]`) and the number of ways to reach the cell to the left of it (`dp[i][j-1]`).

Original Question: Given a `m x n` `grid` filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,3,1\],\[1,5,1\],\[4,2,1\]\]

**Explanation:** Because the path 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 minimizes the sum.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,2,3\],\[4,5,6\]\]
**Output:** 12

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a new grid `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum sum of the path from the top-left corner to the cell `(i, j)`. We can fill this grid iteratively by considering the minimum of the path from the cell above and the cell to the left.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize the first row and the first column of the `dp` grid.
2. For each cell `(i, j)` in the grid (starting from the second row and the second column), calculate `dp[i][j]` as the minimum of `dp[i-1][j]` (the cell above) and `dp[i][j-1]` (the cell to the left), plus the value of the current cell `grid[i][j]`.
3. The minimum sum of the path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner will be stored in `dp[m-1][n-1]`.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def min_path_sum(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Initialize the first row and the first column
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
    for i in range(1, m):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0]
    for j in range(1, n):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j]
    
    # Fill the rest of the dp grid
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
    
    return dp[m-1][n-1]

# Example 1
grid1 = [[1, 3, 1], [1, 5, 1], [4, 2, 1]]
print(min_path_sum(grid1))  # Output: 7

Original Question: Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

*   A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
*   Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than `0` and not exceed `maxWidth`.
*   The input array `words` contains at least one word.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = \[ "This ",  "is ",  "an ",  "example ",  "of ",  "text ",  "justification. "\], maxWidth = 16
**Output:**
\[
    "This    is    an ",
    "example  of text ",
    "justification.   "
\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = \[ "What ", "must ", "be ", "acknowledgment ", "shall ", "be "\], maxWidth = 16
**Output:**
\[
   "What   must   be ",
   "acknowledgment   ",
   "shall be         "
\]
**Explanation:** Note that the last line is  "shall be     " instead of  "shall     be ", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = \[ "Science ", "is ", "what ", "we ", "understand ", "well ", "enough ", "to ", "explain ", "to ", "a ", "computer. ", "Art ", "is ", "everything ", "else ", "we ", "do "\], maxWidth = 20

CoT: To solve the problem of formatting text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified, we can follow these steps:

1. **Iterate through the words and pack them into lines:**
   - Start with an empty list to hold the lines.
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the current line's length.
   - Iterate through each word in the `words` array.
   - If adding the current word to the line would exceed `maxWidth`, add the current line to the list of lines, reset the line length to the length of the current word, and move to the next line.
   - If adding the current word does not exceed `maxWidth`, add the word to the current line and update the line length.

2. ** justifies the last line:**
   - After all words have been packed into lines, the last line may not be fully filled.
   - Calculate the number of extra spaces needed to fill the last line.
   - Distribute these extra spaces evenly among the words in the last line, with extra spaces on the left if necessary.

3. ** format each line:**
   - For each line, calculate the number of extra spaces needed between words.
   - Add the words to the line with the appropriate number of extra spaces between them.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
Original Question: Given a non-negative integer `x`, return _the square root of_ `x` _rounded down to the nearest integer_. The returned integer should be **non-negative** as well.

You **must not use** any built-in exponent function or operator.

*   For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in c++ or `x ** 0.5` in python.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** x = 4
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = 8
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= x <= 231 - 1`
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given a non-negative integer `x`, return _the square root of_ `x` _rounded down to the nearest integer_. The returned integer should be **non-negative** as well. You **must not use** any built-in exponent function or operator. * For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in c++ or `x ** 0.5` in python. **Example 1:** **Input:** x = 4 **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2. **Example 2:** **Input:** x = 8 **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned. **Constraints:** * `0 <= x <= 231 - 1`
CoT: To find the square root of a non-negative integer `x` and round it down to the nearest integer without using any built-in exponent function or operator, we can use a binary search approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize two pointers **: `left` and `right`. Set `left` to 0 and `right` to `x`.
2. ** Perform binary search **: While `left` is less than or equal to `right`, do the following:
   - Calculate the middle point `mid` as `(left + right) // 2`.
   - If `mid * mid` is equal to `x`, return `mid`.
   - If `mid * mid` is less than `x`, set `left` to `mid + 1`.
   - If `mid * mid` is greater than `x`, set `right` to `mid - 1`.
3. ** Return the result **: After the loop ends, `left` will be the smallest integer such that `left * left` is greater than `x`. Therefore, `left - 1` will be the largest integer such that `(left - 1) * (left - 1)` is less than or equal to `x`. Since we are asked to round down to the nearest integer, we return `left - 1`.

Here is the Python code implementing this approach:
Response: python
def sqrt(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 0
    left, right = 1, x
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if mid * mid == x:
            return mid
        elif mid * mid < x:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return right

Original Question: You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 45`

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of distinct ways to climb a staircase with `n` steps, where you can either climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The key insight is that the number of ways to reach the top of the staircase at step `n` is the sum of the number of ways to reach step `n-1` (by taking a 1-step jump from step `n-1`) and the number of ways to reach step `n-2` (by taking a 2-step jump from step `n-2`).

Let's define `dp[i]` as the number of distinct ways to reach step `i`. The recurrence relation is:
\[ dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] \]
with the base cases:
\[ dp[1] = 1 \]
\[ dp[2] = 2 \]

We can implement this in Python as follows:
Response: python
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    if n == 2:
        return 2

    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]

Original Question: Given a string `path`, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.

In a Unix-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory, a double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `'//'`) are treated as a single slash `'/'`. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

The **canonical path** should have the following format:

*   The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.
*   Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.
*   The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.
*   The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

Return _the simplified **canonical path**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** path =  "/home/ "
**Output:**  "/home "
**Explanation:** Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** path =  "/../ "
**Output:**  "/ "
**Explanation:** Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** path =  "/home//foo/ "
**Output:**  "/home/foo "
**Explanation:** In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= path.length <= 3000`
*   `path` consists of English letters, digits, period `'.'`, slash `'/'` or `'_'`.
*   `path` is a valid absolute Unix path.

CoT: To convert an absolute path to its simplified canonical path, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Remove trailing斜** from the path.
2. ** handling period `'.'` and double period `'..'**:
   - When we encounter a period `'.'`, we do nothing.
   - When we encounter a double period `'..'`, we remove the current directory and go up a level.
3. ** handle multiple consecutive slopes**:
   - Replace multiple consecutive slopes with a single slope.

    path = path.rstrip /)

    # Step 2: handle period '.' and double period '..'

    # Ensure the path does not end with a trailing斜
    if simplified_path and simplified_path[-1] == /:

   - We need to keep track of the rows and columns that contain at least one 0.
   - We can use two sets: one for rows and one for columns.

2. **Iterate through the matrix to identify the rows and columns:**
   -遍历 each element in the matrix.
   - If an element is 0, add its row index to the set of rows and its column index to the set of columns.

3. **Set the rows and columns to 0:**
   - Iterate through each element in the matrix.
   - If the row index is in the set of rows or the column index is in the set of columns, set the element to 0.

*   Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
*   The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer `target`, return `true` _if_ `target` _is in_ `matrix` _or_ `false` _otherwise_.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding if a target integer is in a given `m x n` matrix where each row is sorted in non-decreasing order and the first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row, we can use a binary search approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Determine the range of the matrix**: The first element of the matrix is `matrix[0][0]` and the last element of the matrix is `matrix[m-1][n-1]`. If `target` is within this range, it might be in the matrix. Otherwise, it is not.

2. **Binary search for the row**: Perform a binary search on the rows of the matrix to find the row that could contain the target. This is done by comparing the target with the last element of each row. If the target is less than or equal to the last element of a row, then the target could be in that row. Otherwise, it is in a row above it.

3. **Binary search for the element within the row**: Once we have identified the row that could contain the target, perform a binary search within that row to find the target. If the target is found, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:

Original Question: Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them **[in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,0,2,1,1,0\]
**Output:** \[0,0,1,1,2,2\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,0,1\]
**Output:** \[0,1,2\]

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 300`
*   `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

**Follow up:** Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?

CoT: To solve the problem of sorting an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue (represented by integers `0`, `1`, and `2` respectively) in place so that objects of the same color are adjacent in the order red, white, and blue, we can use a three-pointer approach. This approach ensures that we only use constant extra space and make a single pass through the array.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the Python code to implement this solution:

1. Initialize three pointers: `left` to keep track of the position where the next red element (0) should be placed, `mid` to keep track of the current element being considered, and `right` to keep track of the position where the next blue element (2) should be placed.
2. Iterate through the array with the `mid` pointer.
3. If the element at `mid` is `0`, swap it with the element at `left` and increment both `left` and `mid`.
4. If the element at `mid` is `2`, swap it with the element at `right` and decrement `right`.
5. If the element at `mid` is `1`, do nothing and just increment `mid`.
6. After the iteration, the array will be sorted in the order red, white, and blue.

Here is the Python code implementing the above algorithm:
Response: python
def sort_colors(nums):
    left, mid, right = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while mid <= right:
        if nums[mid] == 0:
            nums[left], nums[mid] = nums[mid], nums[left]
            left += 1
            mid += 1
        elif nums[mid] == 2:
            nums[mid], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[mid]
            right -= 1
        else:
            mid += 1
    
    return nums

# Example usage
nums1 = [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]
print排序_colors(nums1))  # Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]

nums2 = [2, 0, 1]

Original Question: Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return _the **minimum window**_ **_substring_** _of_ `s` _such that every character in_ `t` _(**including duplicates**) is included in the window_. If there is no such substring, return _the empty string_ `" "`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "ADOBECODEBANC ", t =  "ABC "
**Output:**  "BANC "
**Explanation:** The minimum window substring  "BANC " includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "a ", t =  "a "
**Output:**  "a "
**Explanation:** The entire string s is the minimum window.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "a ", t =  "aa "
**Output:**  " "
**Explanation:** Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.

**Constraints:**

*   `m == s.length`
*   `n == t.length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 105`
*   `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`, we can use a two-pointer approach along with a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of characters in `t` and the current window in `s`. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Create a dictionary `t_count` to store the frequency of each character in `t`.
   - Create a dictionary `s_count` to store the frequency of each character in the current window of `s`.
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the window.
   - Initialize variables `min_length` and `min_start` to store the length of the minimum window and its starting index, respectively.

2. **Expand the Window:**
   - Iterate over the characters in `s` using the `right` pointer.
   - Update the frequency of the current character in `s_count`.
   - If the frequency of the current character in `s_count` is equal to its frequency in `t_count`, it means the character is included in the window.

3. ** Shrink the Window:**
   - While the window contains all characters of `t`, move the `left` pointer to the right.
   - Update the frequency of the current character in `s_count`.
   - If the frequency of the current character in `s_count` is less than its frequency in `t_count`, it means the character is no longer included in the window.
   - Calculate the length of the current window and update `min_length` and `min_start` if the current window is smaller.

4. **Return the Minimum Window:**
   - If `min_length` is still its initial value, it means no valid window was found, so return an empty string.
   - Otherwise, return the substring of `s` from `min_start` to `min_start + min_length`.

Here's the Python code implementing the algorithm:
Response: python
def min window_substring(s, t):
    t_count = {}
    s_count = {}
    left = 0
    right = 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    min_start = 0

    for char in t:
        t_count[char] = t_count.get(char, 0) + 1

    for char in s:
        s_count[char] = s_count.get(char, 0) + 1
        right += 1

        while all(s_count[char] >= t_count[char] for char in t_count):
            if right - left < min_length:
                min_length = right - left
                min_start = left

            s_count[s[left]] -= 1
            left += 1

    if min_length == float('inf'):
        return ""
    else:
        return s[min_start(min_start + min_length)]

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, k = 2
**Output:** \[\[1,2\],\[1,3\],\[1,4\],\[2,3\],\[2,4\],\[3,4\]\]
**Explanation:** There are 4 choose 2 = 6 total combinations.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1, k = 1

**Explanation:** There is 1 choose 1 = 1 total combination.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all possible combinations of \( k \) numbers chosen from the range \([1, n]\), we can use the `itertools.combinations` function from the Python standard library. This function generates all combinations of a given length from an iterable.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Import the `itertools` module.
2. Define a function `find_combinations` that takes two integers \( n \) and \( k \) as input.
3. Create a list of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
4. Use the `itertools.combinations` function to generate all combinations of length \( k \) from the list.
5. Convert the combinations to a list of lists and return it.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
import itertools

def find_combinations(n, k):
    # Create a list of numbers from 1 to n
    numbers = list(range(1, n+1))
    
    # Generate all combinations of length k
    combinations = list(itertools.combinations(numbers, k))

# Example 1
n = 4
k = 2

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all possible subsets of a given integer array `nums` of unique elements, we can use a recursive approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Base Case**: If the array `nums` is empty, return a list containing an empty list. This is because the power set of an empty set is a set containing only the empty set.

2. **Recursive Step**: If the array `nums` is not empty, take the first element of the array and recursively find all subsets of the remaining elements. Then, for each subset found, create a new subset by adding the first element to it. The combination of these new subsets with the subsets found from the remaining elements will give us all possible subsets of the original array.

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove some duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears **at most twice**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` _after placing the final result in the first_ `k` _slots of_ `nums`.

Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array
int\[\] expectedNums = \[...\]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums\[i\] == expectedNums\[i\];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,1,2,2,3\]
**Output:** 5, nums = \[1,1,2,2,3,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3\]
**Output:** 7, nums = \[0,0,1,1,2,3,3,\_,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`

CoT: To solve the problem of removing duplicates from a sorted array such that each unique element appears at most twice, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: We start with two pointers, `i` and `j`, both initially pointing to the beginning of the array. `i` will be used to iterate through the array, and `j` will be used to place the next unique element in the array.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**: We iterate through the array with the `i` pointer. For each element at position `i`, we check if it is the same as the element at position `j-1` (the previous unique element).

3. **Handle Duplicates**: If the element at position `i` is the same as the element at position `j-1`, we check if it is the same as the element at position `j-2` (the element before the previous unique element). If it is the same, we do not add it to the array (we keep the previous unique element). If it is different, we add it to the array and increment `j`.

4. **Move to Next Unique Element**: If the element at position `i` is different from the element at position `j-1`, we add it to the array and increment `j`.

5. **Return the Result**: After iterating through the entire array, the first `j` elements of the array will contain the final result. We return `j` as the length of the result.

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
Original Question: There is an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with **distinct** values).

Before being passed to your function, `nums` is **rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`0 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `5` and become `[4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the rotation and an integer `target`, return `true` _if_ `target` _is in_ `nums`_, or_ `false` _if it is not in_ `nums`_._

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,5,6,0,0,1,2\], target = 0
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,5,6,0,0,1,2\], target = 3
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
*   `nums` is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
*   `-104 <= target <= 104`

**Follow up:** This problem is similar to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, but `nums` may contain **duplicates**. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?

Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?
CoT: To solve the problem of finding a target value in a rotated sorted array that may contain duplicates, we can use a modified binary search approach. The key is to handle the rotation and duplicates in a way that allows us to efficiently determine if the target is in the array.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the rotation point**: The rotation point is the index where the array is divided into two parts. The left part is in non-decreasing order, and the right part is also in non-decreasing order, but the right part is rotated to the beginning of the array.

2. **Perform binary search**: We can use binary search to find the rotation point. The rotation point is the index where the next element is smaller than the current element.

3. **Check if the target is in the left or right part**: Once we have the rotation point, we can determine if the target is in the left part or the right part of the array. If the target is in the left part, we search in the left part. If the target is in the right part, we search in the right part.

4. **Handle duplicates**: When handling duplicates, we need to ensure that we don't get stuck in an infinite loop. We can do this by checking if the current element is equal to the target. If it is, we return true. If the current element is greater than the target, we move the left boundary to the left. If the current element is less than the target, we move the right boundary to the right.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def search_in_rotated_array(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    rotation_point = -1

    # Find the rotation point
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]:
            rotation_point = mid
            break
        elif nums[mid] < nums[mid - 1]:
            rotation_point = mid - 1
            break
        else:
            left = mid + 1

    # Determine if the target is in the left or right part
    if rotation_point == -1:
        return binary_search(nums, target, left, right)
    elif target >= nums[rotation_point]:
        return binary_search(nums, target, left, rotation_point)
    else:
        return binary_search(nums, target, rotation_point + 1, right)

CoT: To solve the problem of deleting all nodes that have duplicate numbers from a sorted linked list and returning the list sorted as well, we can use a simple approach involving a single pass through the list with a runner-point technique. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialize two-pointers**: Create two pointers, `current` and `next`, where `current` starts at the head of the list and `next` starts at the second node of the list.
2. **Iterate through the list**: While `next` is not None, compare the values of `current` and `next`.
   - If `current` and `next` have the same value, remove `next` by updating `current`'s next pointer to `next`'s next pointer.
   - If `current` and `next` have different values, move `next` to the next node.

CoT: To solve the problem of deleting duplicates from a sorted linked list such that each element appears only once and the list remains sorted, we can use a simple iteration through the list. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialize a variable `previous` to `None`**. This variable will keep track of the previous node in the list.
2. **Iterate through the list using a variable `current`**. For each node in the list, compare its value with the value of the previous node.
3. **If the value of the current node is different from the value of the previous node**, it means the current node is not a duplicate. In this case, we move the `current` node to the head of the list and update the `previous` variable to the current node.
4. **If the value of the current node is the same as the value of the previous node**, it means the current node is a duplicate. In this case, we skip the current node and move to the next node.
5. **Continue this process until the end of the list**. At the end, the list will contain only unique elements in ascending order.

**Example 2:**

CoT: To find the area of the largest rectangle in a histogram where each bar has a width of 1, we can use a stack to keep track of the bars and their heights. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize an empty stack and a variable `max_area` to store the maximum area found.
2. Iterate through the `heights` array.
3. For each bar, while the stack is not empty and the current bar's height is less than the height of the top bar in the stack, pop the top bar from the stack and calculate the area of the rectangle formed by the popped bar and the current bar.
4. Push the current bar onto the stack.
5. After iterating through the entire array, while the stack is not empty, pop the top bar from the stack and calculate the area of the rectangle formed by the popped bar and the next bar in the array (which is the first bar after the stack is empty).

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:

CoT: To find the largest rectangle containing only `1`'s in a binary matrix, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize a new matrix `dp`**: This matrix will store the height of consecutive `1`s ending at each cell in the original matrix. The value `dp[i][j]` will represent the number of consecutive `1`s from row `i` to row `i` (inclusive) ending at column `j`.

2. **Fill the `dp` matrix**: For each cell in the original matrix, if the value is `1`, we set `dp[i][j]` to `1` plus the value of `dp[i-1][j]` (if `i > 0`), otherwise we set `dp[i][j]` to `0`.

3. **Find the maximum area**: For each row in the `dp` matrix, we can find the maximum area of a rectangle with the height given by the values in that row. This is done by finding the maximum product of the height and the width (which is the number of columns).

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: Create two pointers, `left` and `right`. The `left` pointer will point to the head of the list, and the `right` pointer will point to the next node after the head.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Iterate through the list with the `right` pointer. For each node:
   - If the value of the node is less than `x`, move the `left` pointer to the right and swap the values of the nodes at the `left` and `right` pointers.
   - If the value of the node is greater than or equal to `x`, move the `right` pointer to the right.

3. **Stop When `right` reach the End**: Once the `right` pointer reaches the end of the list, stop the iteration.

4. **Set the Partition**: After the iteration, all nodes to the left of the `left` pointer will be less than `x`, and all nodes to the right of the `left` pointer will be greater than or equal to `x`. Set the next node after the `left` pointer as the new head of the list.

Original Question: We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:

1.  If the length of the string is 1, stop.
2.  If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
    *   Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is `s`, divide it to `x` and `y` where `s = x + y`.
    *   **Randomly** decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, `s` may become `s = x + y` or `s = y + x`.
    *   Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings `x` and `y`.

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of **the same length**, return `true` if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  "great ", s2 =  "rgeat "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
 "great " -->  "gr/eat " // divide at random index.
 "gr/eat " -->  "gr/eat " // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
 "gr/eat " -->  "g/r / e/at " // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
 "g/r / e/at " -->  "r/g / e/at " // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
 "r/g / e/at " -->  "r/g / e/ a/t " // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide  "at " to  "a/t ".
 "r/g / e/ a/t " -->  "r/g / e/ a/t " // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is  "rgeat " which is s2.
As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  "abcde ", s2 =  "caebd "
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  "a ", s2 =  "a "
**Output:** true

*   `s1.length == s2.length`
*   `1 <= s1.length <= 30`
*   `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters.

If the length of the string is > 1, do the following: * Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is `s`, divide it to `x` and `y` where `s = x + y`. * **Randomly** decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, `s` may become `s = x + y` or `s = y + x`. * Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings `x` and `y`. Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of **the same length**, return `true` if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, otherwise, return `false`. **Example 1:** **Input:** s1 = "great ", s2 = "rgeat " **Output:** true **Explanation:** One possible scenario applied on s1 is: "great " --> "gr/eat " // divide at random index. "gr/eat " --> "gr/eat " // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order. "gr/eat " --> "g/r / e/at " // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them. "g/r / e/at " --> "r/g / e/at " // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order. "r/g / e/at " --> "r/g / e/ a/t " // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide "at " to "a/t ". "r/g / e/ a/t " --> "r/g / e/ a/t " // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order. The algorithm stops now, and the result string is "rgeat " which is s2. As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true. **Example 2:** **Input:** s1 = "abcde ", s2 = "caebd " **Output:** false **Example 3:** **Input:** s1 = "a ", s2 = "a " **Output:** true **Constraints:** * `s1.length == s2.length` * `1 <= s1.length <= 30` * `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters.

CoT: To determine if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, we can use a recursive approach. The key idea is to check if `s2` can be obtained from `s1` by repeatedly applying the given algorithm. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Base Case**: If the length of `s1` is 1, then `s1` and `s2` must be the same string. This is because there is only one way to split a string of length 1 into two non-empty substrings, and there is only one way to order them (since they are both empty).

2. **Recursive Case**: If the length of `s1` is greater than 1, we need to consider all possible ways to split `s1` into two non-empty substrings `x` and `y` and check if `s2` can be obtained by either swapping `x` and `y` or keeping them in the same order. We do this by recursively checking if the scrambled string of `x` is equal to the first part of `s2` and the scrambled string of `y` is equal to the second part of `s2` (or vice versa).

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def is_scrambled(s1, s2):
    # Base case: if s1 is a single character, s2 must be the same character
    if len(s1) == 1:
        return s1 == s2

    # Recursive case: split s1 into all possible non-empty substrings
    for i in range(1, len(s1)):
        x = s1[:i]
        y = s1[i:]
        # Check if s2 can be obtained by swapping x and y
        if is_scrambled(x, s2[:len(x)]) and is_scrambled(y, s2[len(x):]):
            return True
        # Check if s2 can be obtained by keeping x and y in the same order
        if is_scrambled(x, s2[:len(x)]) and is_scrambled(y, s2[len(x):]):
            return True

    # If none of the splits result in s2, return False
    return False

# Example usage

Original Question: You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array_ `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,2,3,0,0,0\], m = 3, nums2 = \[2,5,6\], n = 3
**Output:** \[1,2,2,3,5,6\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[1,2,3\] and \[2,5,6\].
The result of the merge is \[1,2,2,3,5,6\] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1\], m = 1, nums2 = \[\], n = 0
**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[1\] and \[\].
The result of the merge is \[1\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[0\], m = 0, nums2 = \[1\], n = 1
**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[\] and \[1\].
The result of the merge is \[1\].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

**Constraints:**

*   `nums1.length == m + n`
*   `nums2.length == n`
*   `0 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `1 <= m + n <= 200`
*   `-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109`

CoT: To merge two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` into a single sorted array within `nums1`, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers, one at the end of `nums1` (which is at index `m-1` since `nums1` has `m` elements) and one at the end of `nums2` (which is at index `n-1` since `nums2` has `n` elements).

2. **Compare Elements**: Compare the elements at the current positions of the two pointers. If the element in `nums1` is smaller, move the `nums1` pointer one step to the left. If the element in `nums2` is smaller, move the `nums2` pointer one step to the left.

3. **Place elements**: Place the smaller element into the position of the `nums1` pointer. After placing the element, move the `nums1` pointer one step to the left.

4. **Continue the Process**: Repeat the comparison and placement process until either the `nums1` pointer or the `nums2` pointer reaches the beginning of their respective arrays.

5. **Handle Remaining Elements**: If there are any remaining elements in `nums2` after the `nums1` pointer reaches the beginning, copy these elements into `nums1`.

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def merge arrays(nums1, m, nums2, n):
    # Initialize pointers
    i = m - 1
    j = n - 1
    # Start from the end of nums1
    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
        # Compare elements
        if nums1[i] > nums2[j]:
            # Move nums1 pointer to the left
            nums1[i + j + 1] = nums1[i]
            i -= 1
        else:
            # Move nums2 pointer to the left
            nums1[i + j + 1] = nums2[j]
            j -= 1
    # Handle remaining elements in nums2
    while j >= 0:
        nums1[i + j + 1] = nums2[j]
        j -= 1

# Example usage

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all possible subsets of an integer array `nums` that may contain duplicates, while ensuring that the solution set does not contain duplicate subsets, we can use a recursive approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Define the recursive function**: We'll define a function `find_subsets` that takes the current index in the array, the current subset, and the result list of subsets as parameters. This function will explore all possible subsets by including or excluding the current element at the given index.

2. **Base case**: If the current index is equal to the length of the array, we add the current subset to the result list and return.

3. **Recursive case**: For each element at the current index, we have two choices:
   - Include the element in the current subset and recursively call `find_subsets` with the next index.
   - Exclude the element from the current subset and recursively call `find_subsets` with the next index.

4. **Avoiding duplicates**: To avoid duplicate subsets, we need to ensure that we do not include the same element more than once in the same subset. We can do this by checking if the current element is the same as the element at the previous index and only including it if it is not.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def find_subsets(nums):
    result = []
    current_subset = []
    
    def backtrack(index):
        if index == len(nums):

            backtrack(index+1)
            current_subset.pop()
    
    backtrack(0)
    return result

Original Question: A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be **encoded** into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' ->  "1 "
'B' ->  "2 "
...
'Z' ->  "26 "

To **decode** an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `"11106 "` can be mapped into:

*   `"AAJF "` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`
*   `"KJF "` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`

Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `"06 "` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `"6 "` is different from `"06 "`.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return _the **number** of ways to **decode** it_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "12 "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:**  "12 " could be decoded as  "AB " (1 2) or  "L " (12).

**Example 2:**

**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**  "226 " could be decoded as  "BZ " (2 26),  "VF " (22 6), or  "BBF " (2 2 6).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "06 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:**  "06 " cannot be mapped to  "F " because of the leading zero ( "6 " is different from  "06 ").

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
*   `s` contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of ways to decode a given string `s` containing only digits, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to decode the first `i` characters of the string `s`.

The base cases are:
- `dp[0] = 1` because there is exactly one way to decode an empty string (do nothing).
- `dp[1] = 1` if `s[0]` is not '0', because there is exactly one way to decode a single digit (itself).

For `i` from 2 to `n` (where `n` is the length of the string), we can update `dp[i]` based on the following two cases:
1. The last digit `s[i-1]` can be decode on its own if it is between 1 and 9. In this case, the number of ways to decode the first `i` characters is the same as the number of ways to decode the first `i-1` characters, i.e., `dp[i-1]`.
2. The last two digits `s[i-2]` and `s[i-1]` can be decode together if they form a number between 10 and 26. In this case, the number of ways to decode the first `i` characters is the same as the number of ways to decode the first `i-2` characters, i.e., `dp[i-2]`.

The final answer is `dp[n]`.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def num解 coding(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    dp[1] = 1 if s[0]!= '0' else 0
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # Case 1: Last digit can be decode on its own
        if s[i-1] >= '1' and s[i-1] <= '9':
            dp[i] += dp[i-1]
        
        # Case 2: Last two digits can be decode together
        if s[i-2] == '1' and s[i-1] >= '0' and s[i-1] <= '9':
            dp[i] += dp[i-2]

CoT: To solve the problem of reversing a portion of a singly linked list from position `left` to position `right`, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Create four pointers: `start`, `end`, `startNext`, and `endNext`. `start` will point to the node at position `left-1`, `end` will point to the node at position `right`, `startNext` will point to the next node after `start`, and `endNext` will point to the next node after `end`.
2. **Set Up the Reversal**: Set `startNext` to the head of the list and `endNext` to the next node after the end of the range to be reversed.
3. **Reverse the List**: Iterate from `start` to `end` and reverse the links between the nodes. This can be done by updating the `next` pointer of each node to point to the previous node.
4. **Set the New Heads and Tails**: After the reversal, set the `next` pointer of `startNext` to `endNext` to complete the list.

Original Question: A **valid IP address** consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots. Each integer is between `0` and `255` (**inclusive**) and cannot have leading zeros.

*   For example, `"0.1.2.201 "` and `"192.168.1.1 "` are **valid** IP addresses, but `"0.011.255.245 "`, `"192.168.1.312 "` and `"192.168@1.1 "` are **invalid** IP addresses.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return _all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into_ `s`. You are **not** allowed to reorder or remove any digits in `s`. You may return the valid IP addresses in **any** order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "25525511135 "
**Output:** \[ "255.255.11.135 ", "255.255.111.35 "\]

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into a given string `s`, we can use a recursive approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Define the function**: Create a function `find_ip_addresses` that takes the input string `s` and returns a list of all valid IP addresses.

2. **Base case**: If the length of `s` is 4, it means we have reached the end of an IP address. Check if `s` is a valid IP address by ensuring each segment is between 0 and 255 and does not have leading zeros. If it is valid, add it to the result list.

3. **Recursive case**: If the length of `s` is greater than 4, iterate through the string and consider each possible position to insert a dot. For each position, recursively call `find_ip_addresses` with the remaining part of the string.

4. **valid_ip** function: Create a helper function `valid_ip` to check if a given string is a valid IP address segment. It should check if the string is between 0 and 255 and does not have leading zeros.

Here's the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
def find_ip_addresses(s):
    result = []
    if len(s) == 4:
        if valid_ip(s):
            result.append(s)
        return result
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if valid_ip(s[:i]):
            sub address = find_ip_addresses(s[i:])
            result.extend(sub addresses)
    return result

def valid_ip(s):
    if s == "0" or s[0] == "0" and len(s) > 1:
        return False
    if int(s) > 255:
        return False
    return True

CoT: To solve the problem of generating all structurally unique binary search trees (BSTs) with exactly \( n \) nodes of unique values from 1 to \( n \), we can use a recursive approach. The key idea is to consider each possible root value and recursively generate all possible left and right subtrees.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Base Case**: If \( n = 0 \), there are no trees to generate, so we return an empty list.
2. **Recursive Case**: For \( n > 0 \), we iterate through each possible root value from 1 to \( n \). For each root value \( r \), we recursively generate all possible left subtrees using the values from 1 to \( r-1 \) and all possible right subtrees using the values from \( r+1 \) to \( n \). We then combine each left tree with each right tree to form a new binary search tree with root \( r \).

CoT: To determine the number of structurally unique binary search trees (BSTs) with exactly \( n \) nodes of unique values from 1 to \( n \), we can use a recursive approach. The key insight is that for any given root value \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq n \)), the left子 tree will contain the values from 1 to \( k-1 \), and the right子 tree will contain the values from \( k+1 \) to \( n \). The number of unique BSTs for each of these subtrees can be calculated recursively.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Base Case**: If \( n = 0 \), there is exactly one empty tree, so the number of unique BSTs is 1.
2. **Recursive Case**: For a tree with \( n \) nodes, we can choose any of the \( n \) values as the root. If we choose \( k \) as the root, then there are \( k-1 \) nodes in the left子 tree and \( n-k \) nodes in the right子 tree. The number of unique BSTs for the left子 tree is \( f(k-1) \), and the number of unique BSTs for the right子 tree is \( f(n-k) \). Therefore, the total number of unique BSTs for a tree with \( n \) nodes is the sum of the products of the number of unique BSTs for all possible left and right子 trees:
   \[
   f(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} f(k-1) \cdot f(n-k)
   \]

We can implement this recursive approach with memoization to avoid redundant calculations. Here is the Python code:
Response: python
def count_unique_bst(n, memo):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    
    total = 0
    for k in range(1, n+1):
        total += count_unique_bst(k-1, memo) * count_unique_bst(n-k, memo)
    
    memo[n] = total
    return total

def unique_binary_search_trees(n):
    memo = {}
    return count_unique_bst(n, memo)

Original Question: Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an **interleaving** of `s1` and `s2`.

An **interleaving** of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where `s` and `t` are divided into `n` and `m` substrings respectively, such that:

*   `s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
*   `t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
*   `|n - m| <= 1`
*   The **interleaving** is `s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ...` or `t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...`

**Note:** `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  "aabcc ", s2 =  "dbbca ", s3 =  "aadbbcbcac "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 =  "aa " +  "bc " +  "c ", and s2 into s2 =  "dbbc " +  "a ".
Interleaving the two splits, we get  "aa " +  "dbbc " +  "bc " +  "a " +  "c " =  "aadbbcbcac ".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  "aabcc ", s2 =  "dbbca ", s3 =  "aadbbbaccc "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  " ", s2 =  " ", s3 =  " "
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= s3.length <= 200`
*   `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` consist of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it using only `O(s2.length)` additional memory space?

CoT: To determine if `s3` is an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`, we can use a two-pointer approach. We will iterate through `s3` and check if we can find a way to split `s3` into two parts such that the parts correspond to `s1` and `s2` in an interleaved manner.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Check the lengths of the strings:**
   - If the absolute difference between the lengths of `s1` and `s2` is greater than 1, then `s3` cannot be an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.
   - If the length of `s3` is not equal to the sum of the lengths of `s1` and `s2`, then `s3` cannot be an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.

2. **Initialize two pointers:**
   - One pointer `i` for `s1`.
   - One pointer `j` for `s2`.
   - Both pointers start at 0.

3. **Iterate through `s3`:**
   - For each character in `s3`, check if it matches the current character in `s1` or `s2`.
   - If it matches `s1[i]`, increment `i`.
   - If it matches `s2[j]`, increment `j`.
   - If it does not match either `s1[i]` or `s2[j]`, return false.

4. **Check the positions of the pointers:**
   - After iterating through `s3`, if `i` is equal to the length of `s1` and `j` is equal to the length of `s2`, then `s3` is an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.
   - If `i` is equal to the length of `s1` and `j` is not equal to the length of `s2`, or if `i` is not equal to the length of `s1` and `j` is equal to the length of `s2`, then `s3` is not an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def is_interleaving(s1, s2, s3):
    if abs(len(s1) - len(s2)) > 1:
        return False
    if len(s3)!= len(s1) + len(s2):
        return False

    i, j = 0, 0

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the level order traversal of a binary tree, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph level by level. In the context of a binary tree, we can use a queue to keep track of the nodes at each level.

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. **Initialize an empty queue and an empty list to store the result.**
2. **If the root is not None, add it to the queue.**
3. **While the queue is not empty, do the following:**
   - **Create a new empty list to store the values of the current level.**
   - **For each node in the current level (i.e., the number of nodes in the queue), do the following:**
     - **Remove the front node from the queue.**
     - **Add the value of the removed node to the list for the current level.**
     - **If the removed node has a left child, add it to the queue.**
     - **If the removed node has a right child, add it to the queue.**
   - **Add the list for the current level to the result.**
4. **If the root is None, return an empty list.**

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the zigzag level order traversal of a binary tree, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach with a queue to keep track of the nodes at each level. We will also use a flag to determine the direction of traversal (left to right or right to left) for each level.

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. **Initialize the queue**: Start by adding the root node to the queue.
2. **Initialize the result list**: This will store the zigzag level order traversal.
3. **Set the direction flag**: Start with the left to right direction.
4. **While the queue is not empty**:
   - Determine the number of nodes at the current level by getting the size of the queue.
   - Create a new list to store the values of the nodes at the current level.
   - For each node at the current level:
     - If the direction flag is true (left to right), add the value of the node to the new list.
     - If the direction flag is false (right to left), add the value of the node to the new list in reverse order.
   - Add the new list to the result list.
   - Update the direction flag.
   - Remove the nodes at the current level from the queue.
5. **Return the result list**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[3,9,20,null,null,15,7\]
**Output:** \[\[15,7\],\[9,20\],\[3\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[1\]
**Output:** \[\[1\]\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values_. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root). **Example 1:** **Input:** root = \[3,9,20,null,null,15,7\] **Output:** \[\[15,7\],\[9,20\],\[3\]\] **Example 2:** **Input:** root = \[1\] **Output:** \[\[1\]\] **Example 3:** **Input:** root = \[\] **Output:** \[\] **Constraints:** * The quantity of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`. * `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the bottom-up level order traversal of a binary tree, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. The key is to use a queue to keep track of the nodes at each level. We start by adding the root node to the queue. Then, we repeatedly DEqueue a node, add its value to our result, and enqueue its children (if they exist). We continue this process until the queue is empty. However, since we want the bottom-up order, we need to reverse the order of the levels in the result.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
from collections import deque

def bottom_up_level_order(root):
    if root is None:
        return []
    
    result = []
    queue = deque([root])
    
    while queue:
        level = []
        for _ in range(len(queue)):
            node = queue.popleft()
            level.append(node_val)
            if node left:
                queue.append(node left)
            if node right:
                queue.append(node right)
        result.append(level)
    
    # Reverse the order of the levels
    result.reverse()
    
    return result

# Example usage
root1 = [3, 9, 20, None, None, 15, 7]
root2 = [1]
root3 = []

print(bottom_up_level_order(root1))  # Output: [[15, 7], [9, 20], [3]]
print(bottom_up_level_order(root2))  # Output: [[1]]
print(bottom_up_level_order(root3))  # Output: []

CoT: To determine if a binary tree is height-balanced, we need to check if the difference in height between the left and right subtrees of every node is at most 1. We can achieve this by performing a depth-first search (DFS) on the tree and calculating the height of each subtree.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. **Define a function to calculate the height of a binary tree.**
   - If the root is `None`, the height is 0.
   - Otherwise, the height is 1 plus the maximum height of the left and right subtrees.

2. **Define a function to check if a binary tree is height-balanced.**
   - If the root is `None`, the tree is empty and thus height-balanced.
   - Otherwise, calculate the height of the left and right subtrees.
   - If the absolute difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees is greater than 1, the tree is not height-balanced.
   - Otherwise, recursively check if the left and right subtrees are height-balanced.

Let's implement this in Python:

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return `true` if the tree has a **root-to-leaf** path such that adding up all the values along the path equals `targetSum`.

A **leaf** is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1\], targetSum = 22
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.

**Example 2:**

There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree where the sum of the node values equals a given target sum, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Define the Problem**: We need to find all paths from the root to the leaves where the sum of the node values equals the target sum. Each path should be returned as a list of node values.

2. **Recursive Function**: We will use a recursive function to perform the DFS. The function will take the current node, the current path, and the current sum as parameters. It will explore all paths from the current node to its children.

3. **Base Case**: If the current node is a leaf (i.e., it has no children), we check if the current sum equals the target sum. If it does, we add the current path to the result list.

4. **Recursive Case**: If the current node is not a leaf, we recursively call the function for each child of the current node, updating the current path and the current sum.

5. **Initialize the Result**: We start the DFS from the root of the tree with an empty path and a current sum of 0.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def find_paths(root, targetSum):
    result = []
    def dfs(node, path, currentSum):
        if not node:

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of distinct subsequences of string `s` that equal string `t`, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of distinct subsequences of the first `i` characters of `s` that equal the first `j` characters of `t`.

The base cases are:
- `dp[0][0] = 1` because there is exactly one way to form an empty subsequence from an empty string.
- `dp[i][0] = 1` for all `i` because there is exactly one way to form an empty subsequence from any string.
- `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `j > 0` because it is impossible to form a non-empty subsequence from an empty string.

For the general case, we have two options:
1. If `s[i-1] == t[j-1]`, then we can include `s[i-1]` in the subsequence, so `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]`.
2. If `s[i-1]!= t[j-1]`, then we cannot include `s[i-1]` in the subsequence, so `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`.

Here is the Python code to implement this dynamic programming solution:
Response: python
def count_subsequences(s, t):
    m = len(s)
    n = len(t)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    # Base cases
    for i in range(m + 1):
        dp[i][0] = 1
    for j in range(n + 1):
        dp[0][j] = 0
    
    # Fill the dp table
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if s[i-1] == t[j-1]:

            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]

Original Question: You are given a **perfect binary tree** where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node \*left;
  Node \*right;
  Node \*next;
}

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3,4,5,6,7\]

**Explanation:** Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.

1. **Base Case**: If the root is `NULL`, there is nothing to do. Return ` NULL`.
2. **Recursive Step**:
   - Set the next right pointer of the left child to the right child.

CoT: To solve the problem of populated next right pointers in a binary tree, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. This approach allows us to visit each level of the tree from left to right and set the next pointers accordingly.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize a queue**: Start by adding the root node to a queue. This queue will be used to perform the BFS.

2. **BFS loop**: While the queue is not empty, perform the following steps:
   - Get the number of nodes at the current level by getting the size of the queue.
   - For each node at the current level, do the following:
     - Set the next pointer of the current node to the next node in the queue.
     - Add the left and right children of the current node to the queue.
   - After processing all nodes at the current level, add a null node to the queue to indicate the end of the current level.

3. **Set the next pointer for the last null node**: After the BFS loop, the last null node in the queue will be the end of the last level. Set the next pointer of this null node to `NULL`.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling a stock at different days. The key is to find the minimum price at which the stock was bought and the maximum price at which the stock was sold after the purchase.

We can use a two-pointer approach to solve this problem. We will keep track of the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit that can be achieved. As we iterate through the array, we will update these values accordingly.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize the minimum price `min_price` to the maximum possible value (which is the last element of the array in this case, since we will be comparing it with all other elements).
2. Initialize the maximum profit `max_profit` to 0.
3. Iterate through the array from the first element to the last element.
4. For each element, update the minimum price if the current element is less than the minimum price.
5. Calculate the profit if the stock is sold on the current day (i.e., the current element minus the minimum price).
6. Update the maximum profit if the current profit is greater than the maximum profit.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def max_profit(prices):
    min_price = prices[-1]
    max_profit = 0
    for i in range(len(prices) - 1):
        min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])
        profit = prices[i + 1] - min_price
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
    return max_profit

# Example 1

Original Question: You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return _the **maximum** profit you can achieve_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,1,5,3,6,4\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = \[1,2,3,4,5\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,6,4,3,1\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`

CoT: To determine the maximum profit you can achieve, we can use a simple algorithm that iterates through the list of prices and keeps track of the maximum profit we can make by buying and selling the stock on consecutive days. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initialize two variables: `min_price` to store the minimum price seen so far, and `max_profit` to store the maximum profit seen so far. Set `min_price` to the first price in the list and `max_profit` to 0.
2. Iterate through the list of prices starting from the second price.
3. For each price, calculate the profit if you sell the stock on that day after buying it on the previous day or on the same day. The profit is given by `price - min_price`.
4. Update the `max_profit` by taking the maximum of the current `max_profit` and the calculated profit.
5. Update the `min_price` by taking the minimum of the current `min_price` and the current price.
6. After iterating through the entire list, the `max_profit` variable will contain the maximum profit you can achieve.

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def max_profit(prices):
    min_price = prices[0]
    max_profit = 0
    for price in prices[1:]:
        profit = price - min_price
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        min_price = min(min_price, price)
    return max_profit

# Example usage
prices1 = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
print(max_profit(prices1))  # Output: 7

prices2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(max_profit(prices2))  # Output: 4

Original Question: You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete **at most two transactions**.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = \[1,2,3,4,5\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,6,4,3,1\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 105`

CoT: To determine the maximum profit you can achieve with at most two transactions, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will keep track of the maximum profit we can achieve after each day, considering the constraints of not being able to engage in multiple transactions simultaneously.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit we can achieve after `i` days with `j` transactions.
   - We need to consider three states: `dp[i][0]` (no transactions), `dp[i][1]` (one transaction), and `dp[i][2]` (two transactions).

2. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[0][0] = 0` (no transactions on the first day).
   - `dp[0][1] = 0` (one transaction on the first day).
   - `dp[0][2] = 0` (two transactions on the first day).

3. **Transition Rules:**
   - For `dp[i][0]` (no transactions):
     \[
     dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]
     \]
     We do not perform any transaction on day `i`.

   - For `dp[i][1]` (one transaction):
     \[
     dp[i][1] = \max(dp[i-1][1], prices[i] - dp[i-1][0])
     \]
     We either do not perform a transaction on day `i` or we perform a transaction on day `i` and buy the stock at the minimum price seen so far.

   - For `dp[i][2]` (two transactions):
     \[
     dp[i][2] = \max(dp[i-1][2], prices[i] + dp[i-1][1])
     \]
     We either do not perform a transaction on day `i` or we perform a transaction on day `i` and sell the stock at the maximum profit seen so far.

4. **Iterate Through Days:**
   - Update `dp[i][0]`, `dp[i][1]`, and `dp[i][2]` for each day `i` from 1 to `n`.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The maximum profit after `n` days with at most two transactions is `dp[n][2]`.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def maxProfit(prices):
    n = len(prices)
    dp = [[0] * 3 for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]
        dp[i][1] = max(dp[i-1][1], prices[i-1] - dp[i-1][0])
        dp[i][2] = max(dp[i-1][2], prices[i-1] + dp[i-1][1])

    return dp[n][2]

# Example usage
prices = [3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 3, 1, 4]

Original Question: A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[-10,9,20,null,null,15,7\]
**Output:** 42
**Explanation:** The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 104]`.
*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

CoT: To find the maximum path sum in a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The key is to calculate the maximum path sum that includes the current node and its children. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Define a recursive function** that takes a node as input and returns the maximum path sum that can be formed using that node.
2. **Base Case**: If the node is `None`, return 0.
3. **Recursive Case**:
   - Calculate the maximum path sum that can be formed using the left child.
   - Calculate the maximum path sum that can be formed using the right child.
   - The maximum path sum that includes the current node is the sum of the node's value and the maximum of the path sums of its left and right children. However, we need to consider the case where the path does not include the current node's children if their path sums are negative.
   - Therefore, we return the maximum of:
     - The sum of the node's value and the maximum of the path sums of its left and right children.
     - The maximum path sum of its left child.
     - The maximum path sum of its right child.
4. **Global Maximum**: Keep track of the maximum path sum found so far during the DFS. Update it whenever a larger path sum is found.

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def max_path_sum(root):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    
    def dfs(node):
        if not node:
            return 0
        left_sum = dfs(node left)
        right_sum = dfs(node right)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, node val + max(left_sum, right_sum))
        return node val + max(left_sum, right_sum)

Original Question: A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk` such that:

*   Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
*   Every `si` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
*   `sk == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return _all the **shortest transformation sequences** from_ `beginWord` _to_ `endWord`_, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words_ `[beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** beginWord =  "hit ", endWord =  "cog ", wordList = \[ "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "lot ", "log ", "cog "\]
**Output:** \[\[ "hit ", "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "cog "\],\[ "hit ", "hot ", "lot ", "log ", "cog "\]\]
**Explanation:** There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
 "hit " ->  "hot " ->  "dot " ->  "dog " ->  "cog "
 "hit " ->  "hot " ->  "lot " ->  "log " ->  "cog "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** beginWord =  "hit ", endWord =  "cog ", wordList = \[ "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "lot ", "log "\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** The endWord  "cog " is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= beginWord.length <= 5`
*   `endWord.length == beginWord.length`
*   `1 <= wordList.length <= 500`
*   `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
*   `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all shortest transformation sequences from `begin word` to `end word` using a given dictionary `wordList`, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize a queue and a set for visited words:**
   - Start with the `begin word` in the queue.
   - Create a set to keep track of visited words to avoid processing the same word multiple times.

2. **Define a function to get all neighbors of a word:**
   - A neighbor of a word is another word that differs by exactly one letter.
   - Iterate through each letter in the word and replace it with every other letter in the alphabet to generate all possible neighbors.

3. **Perform BFS:**
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Dequeue a word from the queue.
     - If the word is the `end word`, add the current transformation sequence to the result list.
     - If the word has not been visited, mark it as visited and add all its neighbors to the queue.

4. **Return the result:**
   - If the `end word` is found, return the list of all shortest transformation sequences.
   - Otherwise, return an empty list.

Here's the Python code implementing the above algorithm:

Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`. * `sk == endWord` Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return _the **number of words** in the **shortest transformation sequence** from_ `beginWord` _to_ `endWord`_, or_ `0` _if no such sequence exists._ **Example 1:** **Input:** beginWord = "hit ", endWord = "cog ", wordList = \[ "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "lot ", "log ", "cog "\] **Output:** 5 **Explanation:** One shortest transformation sequence is "hit " -> "hot " -> "dot " -> "dog " -> cog ", which is 5 words long. **Example 2:** **Input:** beginWord = "hit ", endWord = "cog ", wordList = \[ "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "lot ", "log "\] **Output:** 0 **Explanation:** The endWord "cog " is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence. **Constraints:** * `1 <= beginWord.length <= 10` * `endWord.length == beginWord.length` * `1 <= wordList.length <= 5000` * `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length` * `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters. * `beginWord != endWord` * All the words in `wordList` are **unique**.
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The idea is to start from the `begin word` and explore all possible transformations by changing one letter at a time, while keeping track of the distance from the `begin word` to each word. We will use a queue to perform the BFS and a set to store the visited words to avoid revisiting them.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the queue and the visited set:**
   - Create a queue and add the `begin word` to it.
   - Create a set and add the `begin word` to it.
   - Initialize a variable `distance` to 1.

2. **Perform the BFS:**
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Dequeue a word from the queue.
     - If the word is the `end word`, return the distance.
     - Otherwise, generate all possible transformations of the word by changing one letter at a time.
     - For each transformation, if it is in the `wordList` and has not been visited, add it to the queue and the visited set, and update the distance to `distance + 1`.

3. **Return the result:**
   - If the `end word` is not found, return 0.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
from collections import deque

def find transformation_sequence(begin_word, end_word, wordList):
    # Initialize the queue and the visited set
    queue = deque([begin_word])
    visited = set([begin_word])
    distance = 1

    # Perform the BFS
    while queue:
        current_word = queue.popleft()
        if current_word == end_word:
            return distance
        for i in range(len(current_word)):
            for letter in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
                if letter!= current_word[i]:
                    transformed_word = current_word[:i] + letter + current_word[i+1:]
                    if transformed_word in wordList and transformed_word not in visited:
                        queue.append(transformed_word)
                        visited.add(transformed_word)
                        distance += 1

    # Return the result
    return 0

Original Question: Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[100,4,200,1,3,2\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Therefore its length is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1\]
**Output:** 9

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._ You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time. **Example 1:** **Input:** nums = \[100,4,200,1,3,2\] **Output:** 4 **Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

CoT: To find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence in an unsorted array of integers `nums` in `O(n)` time, we can use a set to keep track of the elements we have seen. Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Create an empty set `num_set` to store the elements of the array.
2. Iterate through each element `num` in the array.
3. For each element `num`, check if `num - 1` is in the set. If it is not, then `num` is the start of a new consecutive sequence.
4. If `num - 1` is in the set, then `num` is part of an existing consecutive sequence. In this case, we can check if `num + 1` is in the set. If it is, then we can extend the sequence.
5. Keep track of the maximum length of the consecutive sequence found so far.
6. Return the maximum length.

Here is the Python code for the algorithm:
Response: python
def longest_consecutive_sequence(nums):
    num_set = set()
    max_length = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        if num not in num_set:
            current_length = 1
            while num + 1 in num_set:
                num += 1
                current_length += 1
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
    
    return max_length

# Example 1
nums1 = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
print(longest_consecutive_sequence(nums1))  # Output: 4

# Example 2
nums2 = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]

Original Question: You are given the `root` of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

*   For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.

Return _the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers_. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

A **leaf** node is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** 25
**Explanation:**
The root-to-leaf path `1->2` represents the number `12`.
The root-to-leaf path `1->3` represents the number `13`.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = `25`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[4,9,0,5,1\]
**Output:** 1026
**Explanation:**
The root-to-leaf path `4->9->5` represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path `4->9->1` represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path `4->0` represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = `1026`.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
*   The depth of the tree will not exceed `10`.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers in a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will recursively遍历 the tree, keeping track of the current path value as we move from the root to the leaves. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Define the DFS function**: The DFS function will take a node and the current path value as parameters. It will return the sum of all root-to-leaf numbers starting from that node.

2. **Base case**: If the node is a leaf (i.e., it has no children), we return the current path value.

3. **Recursive case**: If the node has children, we update the current path value by appending the value of the current node to the path value of the left and right children. We then recursively call the DFS function on each child and sum the results.

4. **Initial call**: We start the DFS from the root of the tree with an initial path value of 0.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def sum_of_root_to_leaf_numbers(root):
    def dfs(node, path_value):
        if not node:
            return 0

            return path_value * 10 + node val
        return dfs(node left, path_value * 10 + node val) + dfs(node right, path_value * 10 + node val)

Original Question: Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, _capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by_ `'X'`.

A region is **captured** by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[ "X ", "X ", "X ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "O ", "O ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "X ", "O ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "O ", "X ", "X "\]\]
**Output:** \[\[ "X ", "X ", "X ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "X ", "X ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "X ", "X ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "O ", "X ", "X "\]\]
**Explanation:** Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\[ "X "\]\]
**Output:** \[\[ "X "\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.

The idea is to iterate through each cell in the matrix and if we find an 'O' that is surrounded by 'X', we will flip it and all other 'O's in the same region to 'X'. Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the DFS function**: The DFS function will take the current row `r`, current column `c`, and the matrix `board` as input. It will mark the current cell as visited (by changing it to 'X') and then recursively call itself on the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) if they are within the matrix bounds and are 'O's.

2. **Iterate through the matrix**: We will iterate through each cell in the matrix. If we find an 'O', we will call the DFS function on that cell. This will ensure that all 'O's in the surrounded region are flipped to 'X'.

3. **Return the modified matrix**: After iterating through all cells, the matrix will be modified in place, and we will return it.

Here is the Python code for the solution:

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of cuts needed to partition a string `s` into palindromic substrings, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define `dp[i]` as the minimum number of cuts needed to partition the substring `s[0:i]` into palindromic substrings.

The base case is `dp[0] = 0`, since an empty string is a palindrome and requires no cuts.

For each position `i` from 1 to `n` (where `n` is the length of the string `s`), we need to check all possible positions `j` from 0 to `i-1` to see if the substring `s[j:i]` is a palindrome. If it is, then the minimum number of cuts needed to partition `s[0:i]` is the minimum of `dp[j] + 1` (the minimum number of cuts needed to partition `s[0:j]` plus one cut to split `s[j:i]`).

Original Question: Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List neighbors;
}

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\]\]
**Output:** \[\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\]\]
**Explanation:** There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\[\]\]
**Output:** \[\[\]\]
**Explanation:** Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   `Node.val` is unique for each node.
*   There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.

You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph. **Example 1:** **Input:** adjList = \[\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\]\] **Output:** \[\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\]\] **Explanation:** There are 4 nodes in the graph. 1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4). 2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3). 3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4). 4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3). **Example 2:** **Input:** adjList = \[\[\]\] **Output:** \[\[\]\] **Explanation:** Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors. **Example 3:** **Input:** adjList = \[\] **Output:** \[\] **Explanation:** This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes. **Constraints:** * The quantity of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`. * `1 <= Node.val <= 100` * `Node.val` is unique for each node. * There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph. * The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.
CoT: To solve the problem of return a deep copy of a given node in a connected undirected graph, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to create a new graph that is a complete copy of the original graph, including all nodes and their edges. Each node in the new graph should have the same value and the same neighbors as the corresponding node in the original graph.

2. **Define the Class**: We are given the adjacency list of the graph, where each node is represented by an integer from 1 to the total number of nodes. We need to create a new adjacency list for the cloned graph.

3. **Create a Mapping**: We will use a dictionary to map each node in the original graph to its corresponding node in the cloned graph. This mapping will help us to ensure that each node in the new graph has the same value and the same neighbors as the corresponding node in the original graph.

4. **克隆 the Graph**: Iterate through each node in the original graph and create a new node in the cloned graph with the same value. Then, add the neighbors of the original node to the neighbors of the corresponding node in the cloned graph.

5. **Return the Cloned Graph**: Finally, return the adjacency list of the cloned graph.

Here is the Python code to implement the solution:
Response: python
def克隆图(adjList):
    # Step 1: Create a mapping from original node to cloned node
    mapping = {}
    for i in range(1, len(adjList) + 1):
        mapping[i] = Node(i)
    
    # Step 2:克隆 the edges
    for i in range(1, len(adjList) + 1):
        for neighbor in adjList[i-1]:
            mapping[i].neighbors.append(mapping[neighbor])
    
    # Step 3: Return the adjacency list of the cloned graph
    return [mapping[i].neighbors for i in range(1, len(adjList) + 1)]

Original Question: There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `ith` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith` station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return _the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return_ `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**

**Example 1:**

**Input:** gas = \[1,2,3,4,5\], cost = \[3,4,5,1,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** gas = \[2,3,4\], cost = \[3,4,3\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == gas.length == cost.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104`

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find a starting gas station such that the car can complete a circular route without running out of gas. We can use a greedy algorithm to achieve this.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the net gas available at each station:**
   For each station \( i \), the net gas available is \( gas[i] - cost[i] \). This represents the amount of gas left after traveling from station \( i \) to station \( i+1 \).

2. **Find the starting station:**
   We need to find a starting station \( start \) such that the cumulative net gas from \( start \) to \( start \) (after completing the circle) is non-negative. We can do this by iterating through each station and keeping track of the cumulative net gas. If at any point the cumulative net gas becomes negative, we start over from the next station.

3. **Check if a solution exists:**
   If we can find a starting station such that the cumulative net gas is non-negative after completing the circle, then a solution exists. Otherwise, no solution exists.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def find_starting_station(gas, cost):
    n = len(gas)
    net_gas = [gas[i] - cost[i] for i in range(n)]
    cumulative_gas = 0
    start = 0

    for i in range(n):
        cumulative_gas += net_gas[i]
        if cumulative_gas < 0:
            start = i + 1
            cumulative_gas = 0

    if cumulative_gas >= 0:
        return start
    else:
        return -1

# Example 1
gas1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
cost1 = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
print(find_starting_station(gas1, cost1))  # Output: 3

# Example 2

Original Question: There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

*   Each child must have at least one candy.
*   Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return _the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ratings = \[1,0,2\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** ratings = \[1,2,2\]

**Explanation:** You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

*   `n == ratings.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
*   `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104`

CoT: To solve the problem of distributing candies to children based on their ratings, we need to ensure that each child gets at least one candy and that children with higher ratings get more candies than their neighbors. We can achieve this by iterating through the ratings array twice: once from left to right and once from right to left.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize the candies array:**
   - Create an array `candies` of the same length as ` ratings` and initialize all elements to 1. This ensures that each child gets at least one candy.

2. ** Iterate from left to right:**
   - For each child from the second child to the last child, if the current child's rating is higher than the previous child's rating, give the current child one more candy than the previous child. This ensures that children with higher ratings get more candies than their left neighbors.

3. ** Iterate from right to left:**
   - For each child from the second last child to the first child, if the current child's rating is higher than the next child's rating, give the current child one more candy than the next child. This ensures that children with higher ratings get more candies than their right neighbors.

4. ** Calculate the total number of candies:**
   - Sum up all the candies in the `candies` array to get the minimum number of candies needed.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
def min_candies(ratings):
    n = len(ratings)
    candies = [1] * n

    # Iterate from left to right
    for i in range(1, n):

            candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1

    # Iterate from right to left
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]:
            candies[i] = candies[i + 1] + 1

    # Calculate the total number of candies
    total_candies = sum(candies)

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the single element that appears only once in an array where every other element appears twice, we can use the XOR operation. The XOR operation has the property that any number XORed with itself is zero, and any number XORed with zero is the number itself. Therefore, if we XOR all the elements in the array, the elements that appear twice will cancel each other out, leaving us with the single element that appears only once.

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. Initialize a variable `result` to 0.
2. Iterate through each element in the array `nums`.
3. For each element, XOR it with the current value of `result`.

Original Question: A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` **brand new** nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. **None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list**.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "catsandog ", wordDict = \[ "cats ", "dog ", "sand ", "and ", "cat "\]
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 300`
*   `1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20`
*   `s` and `wordDict[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.
*   All the strings of `wordDict` are **unique**.
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, return `true` if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. **Note** that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation. **Example 1:** **Input:** s = "leetcode ", wordDict = \[ "leet ", "code "\] **Output:** true **Explanation:** Return true because "leetcode " can be segmented as "leet code ". **Example 2:** **Input:** s = "applepenapple ", wordDict = \[ "apple ", "pen "\] **Output:** true **Explanation:** Return true because "applepenapple " can be segmented as "apple pen fruit ". Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word. **Example 3:** **Input:** s = "catsandog ", wordDict = \[ "cats ", "dog ", "sand ", "and ", "cat "\] **Output:** false **Constraints:** * `1 <= s.length <= 300` * `1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000` * `1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20` * `s` and `wordDict[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters. * All the strings of `wordDict` are **unique**.
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will create a boolean array `dp` where `dp[i]` is `True` if the substring `s[0:i]` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize the `dp` array with `False` for all indices except `dp[0]`, which is `True` because an empty string can always be segmented (by definition).

2. Iterate through the string `s` from index 1 to the end. For each index `i`, check if there exists any index `j` such that `dp[j]` is `True` and the substring `s[j:i]` is in the dictionary `wordDict`.

3. If such an index `j` exists, set `dp[i]` to `True`. This means that the substring `s[0:i]` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

4. After iterating through the entire string, the value of `dp[s length]` will be `True` if the entire string `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. Otherwise, it will be `False`.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def can_segment_string(s, word_dict):
    dp = [False] * (len(s) + 1)
    dp[0] = True

                dp[i] = True

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to break down the string `s` into valid dictionary words. We will use a set to keep track of the words we have already used in the current segment to avoid infinite recursion.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the recursive function**: The function will take the current string `s`, the dictionary `word_dict`, and a set `used_words` to keep track of the words already used.
2. **Base case**: If the string `s` is empty, we have found a valid segment. Add the current segment to the result list.
3. **Recursive case**: For each word in the dictionary, check if the word is a prefix of the current string `s`. If it is, recursively call the function with the remaining part of the string `s` after the word, the same dictionary `word_dict`, and the set `used_words` updated to include the word.
4. **Convert the result**: After the recursive calls, convert the result list from a list of tuples to a list of strings.

Here is the Python code implementing the solution:
Response: python
def word break(s, word_dict):
    result = []
    def breakRec(s, word_dict, used_words):

Original Question: Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[3,2,0,-4\], pos = 1
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[1,2\], pos = 0
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[1\], pos = -1
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
*   `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

CoT: To determine if a linked list has a cycle in it, we can use the **Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm**, also known as the **tortoise and the hare** algorithm. This algorithm uses two pointers, one slow (tortoise) and one fast (hare), to detect a cycle in the list. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer.

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. Initialize two pointers, `tortoise` and `hare`, to the head of the linked list.
2. Set a `start` variable to the head of the linked list.
3. While the `hare` is not None and the `hare` is not equal to the `tortoise`, do the following:
   - Move the `tortoise` one step to the next node.
   - Move the `hare` two steps to the next node.
4. If the `hare` is equal to the `tortoise`, there is a cycle in the list. Return `True`.
5. If the `hare` is None, there is no cycle in the list. Return `False`.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def has_cycle(head):
    tortoise = head
    hare = head
    start = head
    while hare!= None and hare!= tortoise:
        tortoise = tortoise.next
        hare = hare.next(next)
        if hare == tortoise:

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the node where the cycle begins in a linked list, we can use the "Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm" (also known as the "tortoise and the hare" algorithm). This algorithm uses two pointers, one moving twice as fast as the other, to detect a cycle in the list. Once a cycle is detected, we can find the starting point of the cycle by moving one pointer back to the head and both pointers forward at the same speed until they meet again.

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. **Initialize two pointers**: `tortoise` and `hare`. Both start at the head of the list.
2. **Move the pointers**: Move `tortoise` one step at a time and `hare` two steps at a time.
3. **Check for a cycle**: If `tortoise` and `hare` meet, there is a cycle.otherwise, there is no cycle.
4. **Find the starting point of the cycle**: Move `tortoise` back to the head and both pointers forward at the same speed until they meet again. The point where they meet is the starting point of the cycle.

CoT: To solve the problem of reordering a singly linked list such that the elements are in the form \( L0 \rightarrow Ln \rightarrow L1 \rightarrow Ln-1 \rightarrow L2 \rightarrow Ln-2 \rightarrow \ldots \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the middle of the list**: Use the two-pointer technique to find the middle of the list. One pointer moves one step at a time, and the other moves two steps at a time. When the second pointer reaches the end, the first pointer will be at the middle.

2. **Divide the list into two halves**: Once we have the middle, we can split the list into two halves. The first half will be from the head to the middle, and the second half will be from the middle to the end.

3. **Reverse the second half**: Reverse the second half of the list. This can be done by iterating through the second half and changing the next pointers to point to the previous nodes.

Original Question: Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a **[Least Recently Used (LRU) cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU)**.

Implement the `LRUCache` class:

*   `LRUCache(int capacity)` Initialize the LRU cache with **positive** size `capacity`.
*   `int get(int key)` Return the value of the `key` if the key exists, otherwise return `-1`.
*   `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the `key` if the `key` exists. Otherwise, add the `key-value` pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the `capacity` from this operation, **evict** the least recently used key.

The functions `get` and `put` must each run in `O(1)` average time complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "LRUCache ",  "put ",  "put ",  "get ",  "put ",  "get ",  "put ",  "get ",  "get ",  "get "\]
\[\[2\], \[1, 1\], \[2, 2\], \[1\], \[3, 3\], \[2\], \[4, 4\], \[1\], \[3\], \[4\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4\]

**Explanation**
LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= capacity <= 3000`
*   `0 <= key <= 104`
*   `0 <= value <= 105`
*   At most `2 * 105` calls will be made to `get` and `put`.

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
CoT: To implement an LRU cache in Python, we can use a combination of a dictionary to store the key-value pairs and a list to keep track of the order of the keys. The list will be used to determine the least recently used key. When the cache is full and a new key is added, we will remove the least recently used key from the list.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Initialize the LRU cache:**
   - Create an empty dictionary ` self.cache` to store the key-value pairs.
   - Create an empty list ` self order` to keep track of the order of the keys.
   - Set the ` self_capacity` to the given capacity.

2. **Add a key-value pair to the cache:**
   - If the key already exists in the cache, update its value and move it to the front of the list.
   - If the key does not exist, add it to the front of the list and store its value in the dictionary.
   - If the number of keys exceeds the capacity, remove the least recently used key (the last element in the list) from the list and from the dictionary.

3. **Get the value of a key:**
   - If the key exists in the cache, return its value.
   - If the key does not exist, return -1.

Here is the Python code for the LRU cache:
Response: python
class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.cache = {}
        self.order = []
        self_capacity = capacity

    def get(self, key):
        if key in self.cache:
            # Move the key to the front of the list
            self order.remove(key)
            self order.append(key)
            return self.cache[key]
        else:
            return -1

    def put(self, key, value):
        if key in self.cache:
            # Update the value and move the key to the front of the list
            self order.remove(key)
            self order.append(key)
            self.cache[key] = value
        else:
            # Add the key-value pair to the front of the list and store the value in the dictionary
            if len(self order) == self_capacity:
                # Remove the least recently used key
                self order.pop()
                self.cache.popitem last()
            self order.append(key)

Original Question: Given the `head` of a singly linked list, sort the list using **insertion sort**, and return _the sorted list's head_.

The steps of the **insertion sort** algorithm:

1.  Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list.
2.  At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list and inserts it there.
3.  It repeats until no input elements remain.

The following is a graphical example of the insertion sort algorithm. The partially sorted list (black) initially contains only the first element in the list. One element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list with each iteration.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[4,2,1,3\]
**Output:** \[1,2,3,4\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[-1,5,3,4,0\]
**Output:** \[-1,0,3,4,5\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5000]`.
*   `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

1. Create a function `insertion_sort` that takes the head of the linked list as input.
2. Initialize an empty list to store the sorted elements.
3. Iterate through the linked list, removing each element and inserting it into the sorted list using the insertion sort algorithm.
4. Return the head of the sorted list.

        sorted_head(next=sorted_list[i])
        sorted_head = sorted_list[i]

CoT: To sort a linked list in ascending order, we can use a **归并排序** algorithm.归并排序是一种** divide-and-conquer **算法，它 works by dividing the list into two halves, sorting each half, and then **merging** the sorted halves back together.

1. **Divide**: If the list has more than one element, split it into two halves.
2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort each half.
3. **Merge**: Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted list.

CoT: To determine the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line, we can use a slope-based approach. We will iterate through each pair of points and calculate the slope of the line they form. We will use a dictionary to keep track of the slopes and the number of points that lie on each line with the same slope.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize a dictionary** to store the slopes and the number of points on each line.
2. **Iterate through each pair of points**.
3. **Calculate the slope** of the line formed by the pair of points. If the points are vertical (i.e., they have the same x-coordinate), we will use a special key to represent the vertical line.
4. **Update the dictionary** by incrementing the count for the slope (or vertical line).
5. **Find the maximum count** in the dictionary, which represents the maximum number of points on the same straight line.

CoT: To evaluate an arithmetic expression given in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), we can use a stack to keep track of the intermediate results. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate through each token in the `tokens` array.
3. If the token is an operator, pop the top two elements from the stack, apply the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.
4. If the token is an integer, convert it to an integer and push it onto the stack.
5. After processing all tokens, the top element of the stack will be the final result.

Original Question: Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return _a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space._

**Note** that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "the sky is blue "
**Output:**  "blue is sky the "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "  hello world   "
**Output:**  "world hello "
**Explanation:** Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "a good   example "
**Output:**  "example good a "
**Explanation:** You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 104`
*   `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.
*   There is **at least one** word in `s`.

**Follow-up:** If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it **in-place** with `O(1)` extra space?

CoT: To solve the problem of reversing the order of words in a given string `s`, we can follow these steps:

1. **Remove leading and trailing spaces**: This ensures that the words are not affected by extra spaces at the beginning or end of the string.
2. **Reverse the entire string**: This will bring the words in reverse order, but they will be separated by all the spaces.
3. **Remove multiple spaces between words**: This step is necessary to ensure that there is only one space between each pair of words in the final output.
4. **Split the string into words**: This allows us to access each word individually.
5. **Reverse the list of words**: This will give us the words in the correct order.
6. ** Join the words with spaces**: This will combine the words into a single string with a space between each word.

Here is the Python code that implements these steps:
Response: python
def reverse_words(s):
    # Step 1: Remove leading and trailing spaces
    s = s.lstrip(' ')
    s = s.rstrip(' ')
    
    # Step 2: Reverse the entire string
    s = s[::-1]
    
    # Step 3: Remove multiple spaces between words
    s = re.sub(r'\s+','', s)
    
    # Step 4: Split the string into words
    words = s.split(' ')
    
    # Step 5: Reverse the list of words
    words.reverse()
    
    # Step 6: Join the words with spaces
    return''.join(words)

import re

# Example usage
s = "the sky is blue"
print(reverse_words(s))  # Output: "blue is sky the"

s = " hello world"
print(reverse_words(s))  # Output: "world hello"

s = "a good example"

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums`, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return _the product_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,-2,4\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** \[2,3\] has the largest product 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[-2,0,-1\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The result cannot be 2, because \[-2,-1\] is not a subarray.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
*   `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
*   The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

CoT: To find the subarray with the largest product in an integer array `nums`, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We need to keep track of the maximum and minimum product of subarrays ending at each position because a negative number can turn a minimum product into a maximum product and vice versa.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize two variables, `max_product` and `min_product`, to the first element of the array.
2. Iterate through the array from the second element to the end.
3. For each element, update `max_product` and `min_product` as follows:
   - `max_product` becomes the maximum of the current element, the product of the current element and the previous `max_product`, and the product of the current element and the previous `min_product`.
   - `min_product` becomes the minimum of the current element, the product of the current element and the previous `max_product`, and the product of the current element and the previous `min_product`.
4. Keep track of the maximum value of `max_product` as you iterate through the array.
5. The maximum value of `max_product` at the end of the iteration is the largest product of any subarray.

Here is the Python code implementing this approach:
Response: python
def max_product_subarray(nums):
    max_product = nums[0]
    min_product = nums[0]
    maxSo far = nums[0]

    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        max_product = max(nums[i], max_product * nums[i], min_product * nums[i])
        min_product = min(nums[i], max_product * nums[i], min_product * nums[i])
        maxSo_far = max(maxSo_far, max_product)

    return maxSo_far

# Example usage
nums = [2, 3, -2, 4]
print(max_product_subarray(nums))  # Output: 6

nums = [-2, 0, -1]
print(max_product_subarray(nums))  # Output: 0

Original Question: Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

*   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
*   `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time.`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,4,5,1,2\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The original array was \[1,2,3,4,5\] rotated 3 times.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,6,7,0,1,2\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The original array was \[0,1,2,4,5,6,7\] and it was rotated 4 times.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[11,13,15,17\]
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** The original array was \[11,13,15,17\] and it was rotated 4 times.

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 5000`
*   `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
*   All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

CoT: To find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array in \( O(\log n) \) time, we can use a binary search approach. The key observation is that in a rotated sorted array, the minimum element is the only element that is smaller than its previous element.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. ** Initialize two pointers **: `left` and `right` to the start and end of the array respectively.
2. ** While `left < right` **:
   - ** Find the middle point **: `mid = (left + right) // 2`.
   - ** Check if the middle element is the minimum **:
     - If `mid` is greater than `right` (i.e., the array is rotated more than half a rotation), the minimum element must be in the right half. So, set `left = mid + 1`.
     - If `mid` is less than or equal to `right` and `nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]` (i.e., the middle element is smaller than its next element), the minimum element must be in the left half or at `mid`. So, set `right = mid`.
     - If `mid` is less than or equal to `right` and `nums[mid] >= nums[mid + 1]` (i.e., the middle element is not smaller than its next element), the minimum element must be in the right half. So, set `left = mid + 1`.
3. ** When `left == right` **: The minimum element is at `left` (or `right`).

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
def find_min_element(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if mid > right:
            left = mid + 1
        elif nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]:
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return nums[left]

# Example usage
nums1 = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
print(find_min_element(nums1))  # Output: 1

nums2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]

Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?
CoT: To find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array that may contain duplicates, we can use a modified binary search approach. The key idea is to use the properties of the sorted and rotated array to determine which half of the array to search in.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. ** Initialize two pointers **: `left` and `right` to the start and end of the array respectively.
2. ** While `left < right` **:
   - ** Find the middle point **: `mid = (left + right) // 2`.
   - ** Check if the middle element is the minimum **:
     - If `nums[mid] < nums[(mid + 1) % n]` and `nums[mid] < nums[(mid - 1) % n]`, then `nums[mid]` is the minimum.
     - If `nums[mid] >= nums[(mid + 1) % n]` and `nums[mid] >= nums[(mid - 1) % n]`, then the minimum element is in the right half of the array. Update `left` to `mid + 1`.
     - If `nums[mid] < nums[(mid + 1) % n]` and `nums[mid] >= nums[(mid - 1) % n]`, then the minimum element is in the left half of the array. Update `right` to `mid`.
   - ** handle duplicates **: If `nums[mid] == nums[(mid + 1) % n]`, we need to move the right pointer to the left until we find a non-duplicate element or reach the start of the array.
3. ** When `left == right` **: The minimum element is `nums[left]`.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def find_min_in_rotated_array(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    left, right = 0, n - 1
    
    while left < right:

Original Question: Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the `MinStack` class:

*   `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
*   `void push(int val)` pushes the element `val` onto the stack.
*   `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
*   `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.
*   `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with `O(1)` time complexity for each function.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "MinStack ", "push ", "push ", "push ", "getMin ", "pop ", "top ", "getMin "\]
\[\[\],\[-2\],\[0\],\[-3\],\[\],\[\],\[\],\[\]\]

*   Methods `pop`, `top` and `getMin` operations will always be called on **non-empty** stacks.

CoT: To solve the problem of implementing a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time, we can use two stacks: one to store the elements and another to store the minimum values up to the current top of the stack. Here's how we can do it:

1. ** Initialize two stacks:**
   - `stack`: to store the elements.
   - `min_stack`: to store the minimum values up to the current top of the `stack`.

2. **推入元素:**
   - When we push an element `val` onto the `stack`, we also need to update the `min_stack`.
   - If `min_stack` is empty or `val` is less than or equal to the top of `min_stack`, we push `val` onto `min_stack`.
   - Otherwise, we push the top of `min_stack` onto `min_stack`.

3. **弹出元素:**
   - When we pop an element from the `stack`, we also need to remove it from the `min_stack`.

4. **获取顶部元素:**
   - When we top the `stack`, we return the top of the `stack`.

5. **获取最小元素:**
   - When we get the minimum element from the `stack`, we return the top of the `min_stack`.

It is **guaranteed** that every right node has a sibling (a left node with the same parent) and has no children. **Example 1:** **Input:** root = \[1,2,3,4,5\] **Output:** \[4,5,2,null,null,3,1\] **Example 2:** **Input:** root = \[\] **Output:** \[\] **Example 3:** **Input:** root = \[1\] **Output:** \[1\] **Constraints:** * The quantity of nodes in the tree will be in the range `[0, 10]`. * `1 <= Node.val <= 10` * Every right node in the tree has a sibling (a left node that shares the same parent). * Every right node in the tree has no children.
CoT: To solve the problem of turning a binary tree upside down, we need to follow the given steps recursively. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Base Case**: If the root is `None`, return `None`.
2. **Recursive Case**:
   - Get the left child of the root.
   - Get the right child of the root.
   - Recursively turn the left child upside down and assign it to the new root.
   - Recursively turn the right child upside down and assign it to the new right child of the new root.
   - Set the left child of the new root to the original root.
   - Set the right child of the new root to `None`.

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def upside_down(root):
    if root is None:
        return None
    
    left = root left
    right = root right
    
    new_root = upside_down(left)
    new_right = upside_down(right)
    
    new_root left = root
    new_root right = new_right
    
    return new_root

Original Question: Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method to read `n` characters.

**Method read4:**

The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

File file( "abcde `"); // File is  "`abcde `", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  "abcd ", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  "e ", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  " ", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The `read` function will only be called once for each test case.
*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** file =  "abc ", n = 4
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abc ". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
Note that  "abc " is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** file =  "abcde ", n = 5
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abcde ". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** file =  "abcdABCD1234 ", n = 12
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abcdABCD1234 ". We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= file.length <= 500`
*   `file` consist of English letters and digits.
*   `1 <= n <= 1000`

CoT: To implement the `read` method using the `read4` method, we need to repeatedly call `read4` until we have read `n` characters. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of characters read.
2. Initialize a variable `i` to keep track of the current position in the file.
3. While `count` is less than `n`, call `read4` to read 4 characters from the file. Update `count` by adding the number of characters read and update `i` by adding the number of characters read.
4. If `count` is equal to `n`, return `count`.
5. If `count` is greater than `n`, return `n`.

Here's the Python code to implement the `read` method:
Response: python
def read(file, n):
    count = 0
    i = 0
    while count < n:
        read4(buf4)
        count += read4(buf4)
        i += read4(buf4)
        if count == n:
            return count
        if count > n:
            return n
    return count

CoT: To implement the `read` method using the `read4` method, we need to carefully manage the reading process and ensure that we do not exceed the size of the `buf` array. Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Create a variable `i` to keep track of the current position in the `buf` array.
   - Create a variable `count` to keep track of the number of characters read so far.

2. **Loop Through each Query:**
   - For each query `n`, we need to read `n` characters from the file.
   - Use a loop to call `read4` until we have read `n` characters or until we reach the end of the file.
   - Update the `count` variable with the number of characters read.
   - Update the `i` variable to point to the next character in the `buf` array.

3. **Return the Count:**
   - After reading `n` characters, return the `count` variable.

Here is the Python code for the `read` method:
Response: python
def read(buf, n):
    i = 0  # Current position in the buf array
    count = 0  # Number of characters read so far

    while count < n:
        read4(buf)
        count += 4
        if count > n:
            count -= (count - n)
        i += 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "ccaabbb "

**Explanation:** The substring is  "aabbb " which its length is 5.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`
*   `s` consists of English letters.
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given a string `s`, return _the length of the longest_ _substring_ _that contains at most **two distinct characters**_. **Example 1:** **Input:** s = "eceba " **Output:** 3 **Explanation:** The substring is "ece " which its length is 3. **Example 2:** **Input:** s = "ccaabbb " **Output:** 5 **Explanation:** The substring is "aabbb " which its length is 5. **Constraints:** * `1 <= s.length <= 105` * `s` consists of English letters.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the length of the longest substring that contains at most two distinct characters in a given string `s`, we can use a sliding window approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `max_length`: This will store the length of the longest valid substring found so far.
   - `left`: This is the left boundary of the current window.
   - `right`: This is the right boundary of the current window.
   - `char_count`: This is a dictionary that keeps track of the count of each character in the current window.

2. **Iterate Over the String:**
   - Start with `left = 0` and `right = 0`.
   - Move the `right` boundary to the right as long as the number of distinct characters in the window does not exceed 2.
   - If the number of distinct characters exceeds 2, move the `left` boundary to the right until the number of distinct characters is back to 2.
   - Update `max_length` with the maximum length of the valid substring found so far.

3. **Update the Count of Characters:**
   - When moving the `right` boundary, add the current character to the `char_count` dictionary and increment its count.
   - When moving the `left` boundary, remove the character at the `left` boundary from the `char_count` dictionary and decrement its count.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - After iterating through the entire string, return the value of `max_length`.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def length_of_longest_substring(s):
    max_length = 0
    left = 0
    char_count = {}
    
    for right in range(len(s)):
        if s[right] in char_count:
            char_count[s[right]] += 1
        else:
            char_count[s[right]] = 1
        
        while len(char_count) > 2:
            char_count[s[left]] -= 1
            if char_count[s[left]] == 0:
                del char_count[s[left]]
            left += 1
        
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_length

# Example usage
s1 = "eceba"

Original Question: Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

*   `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
*   `listA` - The first linked list.
*   `listB` - The second linked list.
*   `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 8, listA = \[4,1,8,4,5\], listB = \[5,6,1,8,4,5\], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[4,1,8,4,5\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[5,6,1,8,4,5\]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 2, listA = \[1,9,1,2,4\], listB = \[3,2,4\], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
**Output:** Intersected at '2'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[1,9,1,2,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[3,2,4\]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = \[2,6,4\], listB = \[1,5\], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[2,6,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[1,5\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
*   The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
*   `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104`
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `0 <= skipA < m`
*   `0 <= skipB < n`
*   `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
*   `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that runs in `O(m + n)` time and use only `O(1)` memory?
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_.

Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null. **Constraints:** * The quantity of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`. * The quantity of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`. * `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104` * `1 <= Node.val <= 105` * `0 <= skipA < m` * `0 <= skipB < n` * `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect. * `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect. **Follow up:** Could you write a solution that runs in `O(m + n)` time and use only `O(1)` memory?
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the intersection of two singly linked lists, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers, one at the head of list A and the other at the head of list B.
2. **Move Pointers**: Move the pointer in list A `skipA` steps forward and the pointer in list B `skipB` steps forward. This ensures that both pointers are at the same relative position in their respective lists.
3. **Check for Intersection**: If the two pointers meet, then the lists intersect at that node. Return the value of the node.
4. **Continue Moving Pointers**: If the two pointers do not meet, continue moving them one step at a time until they either meet or reach the end of their respective lists.
5. **No Intersection**: If the two pointers reach the end of their respective lists without meeting, then the lists do not intersect. Return ` null`.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:

Original Question: Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if they are both one edit distance apart, otherwise return `false`.

A string `s` is said to be one distance apart from a string `t` if you can:

*   Insert **exactly one** character into `s` to get `t`.
*   Delete **exactly one** character from `s` to get `t`.
*   Replace **exactly one** character of `s` with **a different character** to get `t`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "ab ", t =  "acb "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** We can insert 'c' into s to get t.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  " ", t =  " "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** We cannot get t from s by only one step.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length, t.length <= 104`
*   `s` and `t` consist of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits.
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if they are both one edit distance apart, otherwise return `false`. A string `s` is said to be one distance apart from a string `t` if you can: * Insert **exactly one** character into `s` to get `t`. * Delete **exactly one** character from `s` to get `t`. * Replace **exactly one** character of `s` with **a different character** to get `t`. **Example 1:** **Input:** s = "ab ", t = "acb " **Output:** true **Explanation:** We can insert 'c' into s to get t. **Example 2:** **Input:** s = " ", t = " " **Output:** false **Explanation:** We cannot get t from s by only one step. **Constraints:** * `0 <= s.length, t.length <= 104` * `s` and `t` consist of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits.
CoT: To determine if two strings `s` and `t` are one edit distance apart, we need to check if we can transform `s` into `t` by performing exactly one of the following operations:
1. Inserting one character into `s`.
2. Deleting one character from `s`.
3. Replacing one character in `s` with a different character.

We can implement this by comparing the lengths of the two strings and then checking if they differ by exactly one character. If the lengths differ by more than one, they cannot be one edit distance apart. If the lengths are the same, we can check if they differ by exactly one character. If the lengths differ by one, we can check if they differ by exactly one character in the overlapping part.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:
Response: python
def is_one_edit_distance(s, t):
    # Check if the lengths of the strings differ by exactly one
    if abs(len(s) - len(t)) > 1:
        return False

    # If the lengths are the same, check if they differ by exactly one character
    if len(s) == len(t):
        return sum(c1!= c2 for c1, c2 in zip(s, t)) == 1

    # If the lengths differ by one, check if they differ by exactly one character
    # in the overlapping part
    s1, s2 = s[0], s[1:]
    t1, t2 = t[0], t[1:]

    # Case 1: Insertion
    if s1!= t1 and s2 == t2:
        return True

    # Case 2: Deletion
    if s1 == t1 and t2 == s2:
        return True

    # Case 3: Replacement
    if s1!= t1 and s2!= t2:
        return True

    return False

# Example usage

Original Question: A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,1,3,5,6,4\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
*   `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.

CoT: To find a peak element in a given array `nums` in `O(log n)` time, we can use a binary search approach. The key idea is to compare the middle element with its neighbors and eliminate half of the array based on the comparison. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the search range**: Set the left index `l` to 0 and the right index `r` to `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array.

2. **Binary search**: While `l <= r`, do the following:
   - Find the middle index `m` by calculating `m = (l + r) // 2`.
   - Compare the middle element `nums[m]` with its neighbors `nums[m-1]` and `nums[m+1]`.
     - If `m == 0` and `nums[m] > nums[m+1]`, then `nums[m]` is a peak element.
     - If `m == n - 1` and `nums[m] > nums[m-1]`, then `nums[m]` is a peak element.
     - If `nums[m] > nums[m-1]` and `nums[m] > nums[m+1]`, then `nums[m]` is a peak element.
     - If `nums[m] < nums[m-1]`, then the peak element must be in the left half of the array. Set `r = m - 1`.
     - If `nums[m] < nums[m+1]`, then the peak element must be in the right half of the array. Set `l = m + 1`.

3. **Return the peak element**: When the loop ends, `l` will be equal to `r`, and `nums[l]` will be the peak element. Return `l`.

Here's the Python code implementing the above algorithm:
Response: python
def find_peak_element(nums):
    l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while l <= r:
        m = (l + r) // 2

            return m
        elif m == len(nums) - 1 and nums[m] > nums[m-1]:
            return m
        elif nums[m] > nums[m-1] and nums[m] > nums[m+1]:
            return m
        elif nums[m] < nums[m-1]:
            r = m - 1
        else:
            l = m + 1

Original Question: You are given an inclusive range `[lower, upper]` and a **sorted unique** integer array `nums`, where all elements are in the inclusive range.

A number `x` is considered **missing** if `x` is in the range `[lower, upper]` and `x` is not in `nums`.

Return _the **smallest sorted** list of ranges that **cover every missing number exactly**_. That is, no element of `nums` is in any of the ranges, and each missing number is in one of the ranges.

Each range `[a,b]` in the list should be output as:

Original Question: Given two version numbers, `version1` and `version2`, compare them.

Version numbers consist of **one or more revisions** joined by a dot `'.'`. Each revision consists of **digits** and may contain leading **zeros**. Every revision contains **at least one character**. Revisions are **0-indexed from left to right**, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example `2.5.33` and `0.1` are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in **left-to-right order**. Revisions are compared using their **integer value ignoring any leading zeros**. This means that revisions `1` and `001` are considered **equal**. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then **treat the revision as `0`**. For example, version `1.0` is less than version `1.1` because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are `0` and `1` respectively, and `0 < 1`.

_Return the following:_

*   If `version1 < version2`, return `-1`.
*   If `version1 > version2`, return `1`.
*   Otherwise, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** version1 =  "1.01 ", version2 =  "1.001 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** Ignoring leading zeroes, both  "01 " and  "001 " represent the same integer  "1 ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** version1 =  "1.0 ", version2 =  "1.0.0 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** version1 does not specify revision 2, which means it is treated as  "0 ".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** version1 =  "0.1 ", version2 =  "1.1 "
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** version1's revision 0 is  "0 ", while version2's revision 0 is  "1 ". 0 < 1, so version1 < version2.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= version1.length, version2.length <= 500`
*   `version1` and `version2` only contain digits and `'.'`.
*   `version1` and `version2` **are valid version numbers**.
*   All the given revisions in `version1` and `version2` can be stored in a **32-bit integer**.

CoT: To compare two version numbers, we need to break them down into their individual revisions and compare these revisions from left to right. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Extract revisions from both version numbers**: We will iterate through both version numbers and split them at the dot `."` to get the individual revisions. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, we will treat it as `0`.

2. **Compare the revisions**: We will compare the revisions in left-to-right order. If at any point, a revision in `version1` is less than the corresponding revision in `version2`, we return `-1`. If a revision in `version1` is greater than the corresponding revision in `version2`, we return `1`. If all revisions are equal, we return `0`.

Here's the Python code to implement this:
Response: python
def compare_versions(version1, version2):
    # Split the version numbers into revisions
    revisions1 = version1.split('.')
    revisions2 = version2.split('.')

    # Make sure both lists have the same length by padding with zeros if necessary
    max_length = max(len(revisions1), len(revisions2))
    revisions1 += [0] * (max_length - len(revisions1))
    revisions2 += [0] * (max_length - len(revisions2))

    # Compare the revisions from left to right

CoT: To solve the problem of converting a fraction to a string format, we need to handle both terminating and repeating decimal cases. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Determine the integer part of the fraction:**
   - If the numerator is negative, the integer part will be negative.
   - If the numerator is positive, the integer part will be positive.
   - If the numerator is zero, the integer part will be zero.

2. **Convert the absolute value of the numerator to a string and divide it by the absolute value of the denominator:**
   - Use integer division to get the integer part.
   - Use the modulo operation to get the remainder.

3. ** handle the repeating decimal:**
   - Use a dictionary to keep track of the remainders and their corresponding positions in the decimal part.
   - If a remainder appears again, it indicates the start of the repeating sequence.

4. **Construct the final string:**
   - Combine the integer part, the decimal point, and the decimal part.
   - If there is a repeating sequence, enclose it in parentheses.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def fraction_to_string(numerator, denominator):
    if numerator == 0:
        return "0"
    
    integer_part = numerator // denominator
    remainder = numerator % denominator
    decimal_part = ""
    remainders = {}
    
    while remainder!= 0:
        if remainder in remainders:
            start = remainders[remainder]
            non_repeating = decimal_part[:start]
            repeating = decimal_part[start:]
            return f"{integer_part}.{non_repeating}({repeating})"
        remainders[remainder] = len(decimal_part)
        remainder *= 10
        digit = remainder // denominator
        decimal_part += str(digit)
        remainder = remainder % denominator
    
    return f"{integer_part}.{decimal_part}"

# Test the function with the given examples
print(fraction_to_string(1, 2))  # Output: "0.5"

Original Question: Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already **_sorted in non-decreasing order_**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return _the indices of the two numbers,_ `index1` _and_ `index2`_, **added by one** as an integer array_ `[index1, index2]` _of length 2._

The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may not** use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** numbers = \[2,7,11,15\], target = 9
**Output:** \[1,2\]
**Explanation:** The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return \[1, 2\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** numbers = \[2,3,4\], target = 6
**Output:** \[1,3\]
**Explanation:** The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return \[1, 3\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** numbers = \[\-1,0\], target = -1
**Output:** \[1,2\]
**Explanation:** The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return \[1, 2\].

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
*   `numbers` is sorted in **non-decreasing order**.
*   `-1000 <= target <= 1000`
*   The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a specific target, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the beginning and end of the array respectively.
2. While `left` is less than `right`, do the following:
   - Calculate the sum of the elements at the `left` and `right` pointers.
   - If the sum is equal to the target, return the indices of these two elements ( remember to add 1 to each index since the problem asks for the indices added by one).
   - If the sum is less than the target, move the `left` pointer one step to the right ( to increase the sum).
   - If the sum is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer one step to the left ( to decrease the sum).
3. If we have exhausted all possible pairs without finding a solution, return an empty array. However, since the problem guarantees exactly one solution, we don't need to handle this case.

Let's implement this approach in Python:
Response: python
def twoSum(numbers, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(numbers) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    
    return []

CoT: To convert an integer `columnNumber` to its corresponding column title in an Excel sheet, we can use a loop to repeatedly divide the number by 26 and keep track of the remainders. The remainders will represent the letters in the column title, starting from the end.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Initialize an empty string `title`.
2. While `columnNumber` is greater than 0:
   - Compute the remainder of `columnNumber` divided by 26.
   - Convert the remainder to the corresponding letter (A for 1, B for 2,..., Z for 26).
   - Add the letter to the beginning of `title`.
   - Update `columnNumber` to be the integer division of `columnNumber` by 26.
3. Return `title`.

Here is the Python code implementing this algorithm:
Response: python
def column.title(columnNumber):
    title = ""
    while columnNumber > 0:
        remainder = columnNumber % 26
        letter = chr(64 + remainder)  # Convert remainder to corresponding letter (A-Z)
        title = letter + title
        columnNumber //= 26

Original Question: Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return _the majority element_.

CoT: To find the majority element in an array `nums` of size `n` that appears more than `n / 2` times, we can use the ** boyd's algorithm** (also known as the **majority vote algorithm**). This algorithm works by iterating through the array and keeping track of a candidate for the majority element and a count of how many times it has appeared so far. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize a variable `candidate` to store the current candidate for the majority element and a variable `count` to keep track of the number of times the candidate has appeared.
2. Iterate through the array `nums`.
3. If the current element is equal to the `candidate`, increment the `count`.
4. If the current element is not equal to the `candidate` and the `count` is greater than 0, decrement the `count`.
5. If the current element is not equal to the `candidate` and the `count` is 0, set the `candidate` to the current element and increment the `count`.
6. After iterating through the array, the `candidate` will be the majority element.

Here's the Python code to implement this algorithm:

def find_majority_element(nums):
    candidate = None

CoT: To convert a column title in an Excel sheet to its corresponding column number, we need to consider the following:

1. Each letter in the alphabet corresponds to a number from 1 to 26.
2. The column title can be a single letter or a combination of letters.
3. For a single letter, the column number is the position of the letter in the alphabet.
4. For a combination of letters, the column number is calculated by considering each letter as a digit in a base-26 number system.

Let's break down the conversion process step by step:

1. **Convert each letter to its corresponding number:**
   - For example, 'A' is 1, 'B' is 2,..., 'Z' is 26.

2. **Calculate the base-26 value:**
   - For a combination of letters, the base-26 value is calculated by multiplying the position of each letter by 26 raised to the power of its position in the title (from right to left, starting with 0).

Original Question: Implement the `BSTIterator` class that represents an iterator over the **[in-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#In-order_(LNR))** of a binary search tree (BST):

*   `BSTIterator(TreeNode root)` Initializes an object of the `BSTIterator` class. The `root` of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.
*   `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns `false`.
*   `int next()` Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the pointer.

Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to `next()` will return the smallest element in the BST.

You may assume that `next()` calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next number in the in-order traversal when `next()` is called.

That is, there will be at least a next quantity in the in-order traversal when `next()` is called. **Example 1:** **Input** \[ "BSTIterator ", "next ", "next ", "hasNext ", "next ", "hasNext ", "next ", "hasNext ", "next ", "hasNext "\] \[\[\[7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20\]\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\] **Output** \[null, 3, 7, true, 9, true, 15, true, 20, false\] **Explanation** BSTIterator bSTIterator = new BSTIterator(\[7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20\]); bSTIterator.next(); // return 3 bSTIterator.next(); // return 7 bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True bSTIterator.next(); // return 9 bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True bSTIterator.next(); // return 15 bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True bSTIterator.next(); // return 20 bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return False **Constraints:** * The quantity of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 105]`. * `0 <= Node.val <= 106` * At most `105` calls will be made to `hasNext`, and `next`. **Follow up:** * Could you implement `next()` and `hasNext()` to run in average `O(1)` time and use `O(h)` memory, where `h` is the height of the tree?
CoT: To implement the `BST iterator` class that represents an in-order traversal of a binary search tree (BST), we can use a stack to keep track of the nodes. The stack will store the nodes in the order they are visited during the in-order traversal. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. ** Initialize the stack and the current node:**
   - Start with the root node of the tree.
   - While the current node has a left child, push the left child onto the stack and move to the left child.
   - If the current node does not have a left child, pop the stack to get the next node in the in-order sequence and move to that node.

2. ** Implement the ` next()` method:**
   - Pop the stack to get the next node in the in-order sequence.
   - Move to the left child of the current node and repeat the process until the current node has no left child.
   - Return the value of the current node.

3. ** Implement the ` hasNext()` method:**
   - Check if the stack is empty. If it is empty, there are no more nodes to visit, so return `false`.
   - Otherwise, there is at least one more node to visit, so return `true`.

Here's the Python code for the ` BST iterator` class:
Response: python
class binary Search Tree:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        self stack = []

        # Initialize the current node to the root
        self(current_node = root

        # Push all left children onto the stack
        while current_node:
            self stack.append(current_node)
            current_node = current_node left

    def next(self):
        if not self stack:
            return None

        # Pop the stack to get the next node in the in-order sequence
        current_node = self stack.pop()

        # Move to the left child of the current node
        while current_node:
            self stack.append(current_node)
            current_node = current_node left

        return current_node_val

Original Question: The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in **the bottom-right corner** of a `dungeon`. The `dungeon` consists of `m x n` rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in **the top-left room** and must fight his way through `dungeon` to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to `0` or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).

To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only **rightward** or **downward** in each step.

Return _the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess_.

**Note** that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** dungeon = \[\[-2,-3,3\],\[-5,-10,1\],\[10,30,-5\]\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** The initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path: RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** dungeon = \[\[0\]\]
**Output:** 1

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
CoT: To determine the minimum initial health the knight needs to rescue the princess, we can use dynamic programming. We start from the bottom-right corner of the dungeon and work our way up to the top-left corner, calculating the minimum health required at each room.

Let's define `dp[i][j]` as the minimum initial health required to reach the bottom-right corner from room \((i, j)\).

The base case is:
- \( dp[m-1][n-1] = \max(1, -dungeon[m-1][n-1]) \)
  - If the princess is in a room with a positive health bonus, the knight needs at least 1 health to reach her.
  - If the princess is in a room with a negative health bonus, the knight needs at least \( -dungeon[m-1][n-1} \) health to reach her.

For the other rooms, we use the following recurrence relation:
- \( dp[i][j] = \max(1, \min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1]) - dungeon[i][j]) \)
  - The knight can move either right or down.
  - The minimum initial health required to reach the bottom-right corner from room \((i, j)\) is the minimum of the initial health required from the next room to the right and the next room below, minus the health change in room \((i, j)\).
  - If the result is negative, the knight needs at least 1 health to reach the bottom-right corner.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
def minInitialHealth(dungeon):
    m, n = len(dungeon), len(dungeon[0])
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Base case

    # Fill the dp table from bottom-right to top-left
    for i in range(m-1, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if i == m-1 and j == n-1:
                continue
            dp[i][j] = max(1, min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1]) - dungeon[i][j])
    
    return dp[0][0]

CoT: To solve the problem of arranging a list of non-negative integers `nums` to form the largest possible quantity, we need to consider the custom comparison between two numbers. Instead of the usual numerical comparison, we should compare the numbers as if they were strings, but in a way that the concatenation of the two numbers in either order results in the larger number.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define a custom comparison function**: We need a function that takes two integers `a` and `b` and returns `True` if the concatenation of `a` and `b` is greater than the concatenation of `b` and `a`. This can be done by comparing the strings formed by concatenating `a` and `b` in both orders.

2. **Sort the list using the custom comparison function**: Use the custom comparison function to sort the list `nums`. The sorting algorithm will arrange the numbers in such a way that the concatenation of the entire list forms the largest possible number.

3. **Convert the sorted list to a string**: After sorting the list, convert it to a string by concatenating all the elements.

Here is the Python code that implements the solution:
Response: python
def custom comparison(a, b):
    return (str(a) + str(b)) > (str(b) + str(a))

def largest_number(nums):
    nums.sort(key=lambda x: x * 10**len(str(x)), reverse=True)
    return ''.join(map(str, nums))

# Example usage
nums1 = [10, 2]
print(largest_number(nums1))  # Output: "210"

nums2 = [3, 30, 34, 5, 9]

Original Question: Given a character array `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by a single space.

Your code must solve the problem **in-place,** i.e. without allocating extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = \["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`
*   `s[i]` is an English letter (uppercase or lowercase), digit, or space `' '`.

CoT: To solve the problem of reversing the order of words in a given character array `s` in Python, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert the array to a list of words**: Since the words are separated by a single space, we can split the array into a list of words using the `split` method.
2. **Reverse the list of words**: Use the `reverse` method to reverse the order of the words in the list.
3. **Convert the list back to an array**: Join the words in the list back into a single array using the `join` method.

Evaluation Result: **Correctness:**
**Reasoning Score:** 2

Explanation:

The code does not correctly implement the problem requirements. It first splits the input array into a list of words using the `split` method, which is correct. However, it then reverses the list of words using the `reverse` method, which is also correct. However, it then attempts to convert the list back to an array using the `join` method, but this is incorrect because the `join` method requires an iterable of strings, not a list of strings. 

Moreover, the code does not solve the problem in-place, as required by the problem statement. It allocates extra space to store the list of words.

The reasoning score is 2 because the code partially implements the problem requirements, but it does not address the in-place constraint and the issue with the `join` method. 

To solve the problem correctly, the code should reverse the words in-place without allocating extra space. Here is a revised version of the code that implements this:

```python
def reverse_words(s):
    def reverse(s, start, end):
        while start < end:
            s[start], s[end] = s[end], s[start]
            start += 1
            end -= 1

    # Reverse the entire string
    reverse(s, 0, len(s) - 1)

    # Reverse each word
    word_start = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] =='':
            reverse(s, word_start, i - 1)
            word_start = i + 1

    # Reverse the last word
    reverse(s, word_start, len(s) - 1)

    return s
```

This revised code correctly implements the problem requirements and solves the problem in-place.

- If we do not perform any transaction on the `i`-th day, the profit remains the same as the profit we can achieve with `j` transactions up to the `(i-1)`-th day.
- If we perform a transaction on the `i`-th day, we can either buy or sell. If we buy, the profit is the profit we can achieve with `j-1` transactions up to the `(i-1)`-th day minus the price of the stock on the `i`-th day. If we sell, the profit is the profit we can achieve with `j` transactions up to the `(i-1)`-th day plus the price of the stock on the `i`-th day.

The base case is `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `j` because with no transactions, the profit is 0. We will iterate through each day and each possible number of transactions to fill in the `dp` array.

    n = len(nums)
    k = k % n  # handle larger k values by taking modulo n
    result = [0] * n
    
    for i in range(n):
        result[(i + k) % n] = nums[i]
    
    return result

CoT: To reverse the bits of a given 32-bit unsigned integer, we can use a simple algorithm that iterates through each bit of the integer and swaps it with its corresponding bit from the other end. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable `reversed` to 0. This variable will store the reversed integer.
2. Iterate through each bit of the input integer from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the most significant bit (leftmost).
3. For each bit, shift the corresponding bit from the input integer to the most significant bit position in the `reversed` variable.
4. After the loop, the `reversed` variable will contain the reversed integer.

Here's the Python code to implement this algorithm:
Response: python
def reverse_bits(n):
    reversed = 0
    for i in range(32):
        reversed = (reversed << 1) | (n & 1)
        n = n >> 1

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the Hamming weight of an unsigned integer, we can use a simple algorithm that iterates through each bit of the binary representation and counts the number of '1' bits. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Convert the integer to its binary representation**: Since the integer is given as a binary string, we don't need to convert it. We can directly work with the binary string.

2. **Iterate through each bit**: We will loop through each character in the binary string from left to right.

3. **Count the '1' bits**: For each character, if it is '1', we increment a counter.

4. **Return the count**: After iterating through all the bits, we return the counter value, which represents the Hamming weight.

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def hamming_weight(binary_string):
    # Initialize the counter for '1' bits
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each character in the binary string
    for bit in binary_string:
        # If the bit is '1', increment the counter
        if bit == '1':
            count += 1
    
    # Return the count of '1' bits

You may assume that each row has the same number of columns, and each field is separated by the `' '` character.

**Example:**

If `file.txt` has the following content:

name age
alice 21
ryan 30

Output the following:

You may assume that each row has the same quantity of columns, and each field is separated by the `' '` character. **Example:** If `file.txt` has the following content: name age alice 21 ryan 30 Output the following: name alice ryan age 21 30
CoT: To transpose the content of the text file `file.txt` where each row has the same number of columns and each field is separated by a space, we can use Python's `numpy` library which provides a convenient way to transpose matrices. Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. Read the file `file.txt` into a list of lists.
2. Transpose the list of lists using `numpy`'s `numpy.transpose` function.
3. Convert the transposed list of lists back into a string with each row separated by a new line and each field within a row separated by a space.
4. Write the transposed content to a new file.

# Step 1: Read the file into a list of lists
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    data = [line.split() for line in file]

# Step 2: Transpose the list of lists
transposed_data = np.transpose(data)

# Step 3: Convert the transposed list of lists back into a string

Original Question: You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define `dp[i]` as the maximum amount of money we can Rob from the first `i` houses without alerting the police.

The recurrence relation for `dp[i]` can be defined as follows:
- If we do not rove house `i`, then the maximum amount of money we can Rob from the first `i` houses is the same as the maximum amount of money we can Rob from the first `i-1` houses, i.e., `dp[i] = dp[i-1]`.
- If we rove house `i`, then we cannot rove house `i-1`, so the maximum amount of money we can Rob from the first `i` houses is the sum of the money in house `i` and the maximum amount of money we can Rob from the first `i-2` houses, i.e., `dp[i] = nums[i] + dp[i-2]`.

We need to consider the base cases:
- If `i = 0`, then `dp[0] = 0` (we have not roved any houses).
- If `i = 1`, then `dp[1] = nums[1]` (we can rove the first house).

Using this recurrence relation, we can fill in the `dp` array from `i = 2` to `i = n` (where `n` is the number of houses). The final answer will be `dp[n]`.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def max_money(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = nums[0]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], nums[i-1] + dp[i-2])
    return dp[n]

# Example 1
nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 1]

**Example 3:**

*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given the `root` of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the **right side** of it, return _the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom_. **Example 1:** **Input:** root = \[1,2,3,null,5,null,4\] **Output:** \[1,3,4\] **Example 2:** **Input:** root = \[1,null,3\] **Output:** \[1,3\] **Example 3:** **Input:** root = \[\] **Output:** \[\] **Constraints:** * The quantity of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`. * `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the values of the nodes visible from the right side of a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. Specifically, we will perform a right-to-left DFS, keeping track of the maximum value seen so far at each level of the tree. This way, we can ensure that we only see the rightmost node at each level.

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. **Define the function `right_side_view`**:
   - This function takes the root of the binary tree as input.
   - It returns a list of integers representing the values of the nodes visible from the right side.

2. ** Initialize an empty list `result`**:
   - This list will store the values of the visible nodes.

3. **Define a helper function `dfs`**:
   - This function takes a node and the current maximum value as input.
   - It checks if the node is None. If it is, it returns.
   - If the node is not None, it checks if the value of the node is greater than the current maximum value. If it is, it adds the value to the `result` list.
   - It then calls itself recursively on the right child of the node with the current maximum value.
   - Finally, it calls itself recursively on the left child of the node with the current maximum value.

4. ** Call the `dfs` function on the root node with an initial maximum value of negative infinity**:
   - This ensures that the first node visited at each level will be added to the `result` list.

5. ** Return the `result` list**.

Here is the Python code implementing the above steps:
Response: python
def right_side_view(root):
    result = []

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of islands in a given `m x n` 2D binary grid, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The idea is to iterate through each cell in the grid and, if we find a land cell (i.e., a cell with value `1`), we start a DFS from that cell to Mark all the connected land cells as visited. Each DFS call represents a new island. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize a variable `island_count` to 0 to keep track of the number of islands.
2. Iterate through each row and each column of the grid.
3. If a cell contains a `1`, increment `island_count` by 1 and perform a DFS starting from that cell.
4. In the DFS function, Mark the current cell as visited by changing its value to `0`.
5. Recursively call DFS on the adjacent cells (up, down, left, and right) if they contain a `1`.
6. After iterating through all cells, `island_count` will contain the total number of islands.

Here's the Python code implementing the above algorithm:
Response: python
def numIslands(grid):
    m = len(grid)
    n = len(grid[0])
    island_count = 0

Original Question: Given two integers `left` and `right` that represent the range `[left, right]`, return _the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** left = 5, right = 7
**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** left = 0, right = 0
**Output:** 0

**Example 3:**

**Input:** left = 1, right = 2147483647
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= left <= right <= 231 - 1`
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given two integers `left` and `right` that represent the range `[left, right]`, return _the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive_. **Example 1:** **Input:** left = 5, right = 7 **Output:** 4 **Example 2:** **Input:** left = 0, right = 0 **Output:** 0 **Example 3:** **Input:** left = 1, right = 2147483647 **Output:** 0 **Constraints:** * `0 <= left <= right <= 231 - 1`
CoT: To find the bitwise AND of all numbers in a given range \([left, right]\), we can use the following approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to perform a bitwise AND operation on all integers from `left` to `right`, inclusive.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The bitwise AND of a range of numbers will have a 0 in any bit position where at least one number in the range has a 0 in that position.

3. **Find the Most Significant bit (MSB) of the Range:**
   - The MSB of the range is the highest bit that is set in `left`.
   - If `left` and `right` have different MSB positions, the result will have a 0 in the MSB position of `left` because there will be at least one number in the range with a 0 in that position.

4. **Determine the Result:**
   - If `left` and `right` have the same MSB position, the result will have a 1 in that position.
   - This process continues until we reach the least significant bit (LSB).

5. ** Algorithm:**
   - Perform a bitwise AND operation on `left` and `right` to find the common bits.
   - The result of this operation will be the bitwise AND of all numbers in the range.

Here is the Python code to implement this approach:
Response: python
def range_bitwise_and(left, right):

Original Question: Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:

*   Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
*   Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1.
*   Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy.

Return `true` _if_ `n` _is a happy number, and_ `false` _if not_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 19
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`

CoT: To determine if a number is happy, we can use a simple algorithm that follows the process described in the problem. We will repeatedly replace the number with the sum of the squares of its digits until we either reach 1 or determine that we are in a cycle that does not include 1. To detect a cycle, we can use a set to keep track of the numbers we have seen before. If we encounter a number that is already in the set, we know we are in a cycle.

Here is the Python code to implement this algorithm:

def is_happy(n):
    # Create a set to keep track of the numbers we have seen before

CoT: To solve the problem of removing all nodes from a linked list that have a value equal to `val`, we can use a simple iterative approach. We'll create a new head for the list and keep a pointer to the current head. As we iterate through the list, we'll check each node's value. If the value is equal to `val`, we'll skip the node and move to the next one. If the value is not equal to `val`, we'll add the node to the new list.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the quantity of prime numbers that are strictly less than a given integer `n`, we can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. This algorithm is an efficient way to find all prime numbers up to any given limit. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm and the Python code to implement it:

1. **Initialize a list of boolean values**: Create a list `is_prime` of length `n` and set all values to `True`. This list will help us determine whether each number is prime or not.
2. **Set 0 and 1 as not prime**: Since 0 and 1 are not prime numbers, set `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` to `False`.
3. **Sieve the primes**: Iterate over the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`. For each number `p` that is marked as prime (`is_prime[p]` is `True`), mark all multiples of `p` as not prime. This is done by setting `is_prime[p * p]` to `False` and then incrementing `p` to check the next number.
4. **Count the primes**: After sifting out the non-prime numbers, count the number of `True` values in the `is_prime` list. This count will give us the number of prime numbers less than `n`.

Here's the Python code that implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm:
Response: python
def count_primes(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize a list of boolean values
    is_prime = [True] * n
    
    # Set 0 and 1 as not prime
    is_prime[0] = False
    is_prime[1] = False
    
    # Sieve the primes
    p = 2
    while p * p < n:

            for i in range(p * p, n, p):
                is_prime[i] = False
        p += 1
    
    # Count the primes
    prime_count = sum(is_prime)
    
    return prime_count

Could you implement both?
CoT: To reverse a given singly linked list, we can use both iterative and recursive approaches. Let's start with the iterative approach.

### Iterative Approach

In the iterative approach, we use three-pointers: `current`, `previous`, and `next`. We start with `current` as the head of the list, `previous` as `None`, and `next` as `current`. As we iterate through the list, we update the pointers such that `next` becomes the new `current`, `current` becomes the new `previous`, and `previous` becomes `None` when `current` is no longer needed. Finally, we set the head of the list to `previous`, which will be the last node in the original list.

Here is the Python code for the iterative approach:
Response: python
def reverse_list_iterative(head):
    previous = None
    current = head
    next = None

    while current is not None:

        current(next)
        previous = current
        current = next

    head = previous

CoT: To determine if it is possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites, we can use a topological sort algorithm. Topological sort is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed graph such that for every directed edge \(u \rightarrow v\), vertex \(u\) comes before vertex \(v\) in the ordering. If a topological sort exists, the graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and it is possible to finish all courses.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. ** Create a graph from the prerequisites:**
   - Initialize an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Initialize an array to keep track of the in-degrees (number of incoming edges) of each vertex.

2. ** build the graph and in-degrees:**
   - For each prerequisite pair \([ai, bi]\), add an edge from \(bi\) to \(ai\) in the adjacency list and increment the in-degree of \(ai\).

3. ** Find vertices with in-degree 0:**
   - These vertices have no prerequisites and can be taken first. Add them to a queue.

4. ** Perform topological sort:**
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Remove a vertex from the queue.
     - Add this vertex to the topological order.
     - For each neighbor of the removed vertex, decrease its in-degree by 1.
     - If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.

5. ** Check if all vertices are in the topological order:**
   - If the number of vertices in the topological order is equal to the total number of vertices, then it is possible to finish all courses. Otherwise, it is not possible.

Here is the Python code implementing the above steps:

Implement the Trie class: * `Trie()` Initializes the trie object. * `void insert(String word)` Inserts the string `word` into the trie. * `boolean search(String word)` Returns `true` if the string `word` is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and `false` otherwise. * `boolean startsWith(String prefix)` Returns `true` if there is a previously inserted string `word` that has the prefix `prefix`, and `false` otherwise. **Example 1:** **Input** \[ "Trie ", "insert ", "search ", "search ", "startsWith ", "insert ", "search "\] \[\[\], \[ "apple "\], \[ "apple "\], \[ "app "\], \[ "app "\], \[ "app "\], \[ "app "\]\] **Output** \[null, null, true, false, true, null, true\] **Explanation** Trie trie = new Trie(); trie.insert( "apple "); trie.search( "apple "); // return True trie.search( "app "); // return False trie.startsWith( "app "); // return True trie.insert( "app "); trie.search( "app "); // return True **Constraints:** * `1 <= word.length, prefix.length <= 2000` * `word` and `prefix` consist only of lowercase English letters. * At most `3 * 104` calls **in total** will be made to `insert`, `search`, and `startsWith`.
CoT: To implement the Trie class, we need to define the following methods: `Trie()`, `insert(String word)`, `search(String word)`, and ` startsWith(String prefix)`. We will use a dictionary to store the children of each node in the tree. Each node will have a dictionary of its children, and each child will have a key corresponding to a letter in the word. If a child does not exist, we will create a new child with an empty dictionary.

Here is the implementation in Python:
Response: python
class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = {}
    
    def insert(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for letter in word:
            if letter not in node:
                node[letter] = {}
            node = node[letter]
        node['#'] = True
    
    def search(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for letter in word:
            if letter not in node:
                return False
            node = node[letter]
        return '#' in node
    
    def startsWith(self, prefix):
        node = self.root
        for letter in prefix:
            if letter not in node:
                return False
            node = node[letter]
        return len(node) > 0

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to a given target, we can use a two-pointer approach. This approach involves maintaining a sliding window over the array and adjusting the window's size to find the minimum length that meets the target sum.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning and Python code to solve the problem:

1. **Initialize Pointers and Sum:**
   - Set two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the array.
   - Initialize a variable `current_sum` to 0 to keep track of the sum of the elements in the current subarray.

2. **Expand the Right Pointers:**
   - Move the `right` pointer to the right, adding the value of the element at the `right` position to `current_sum`.
   - If `current_sum` becomes greater than or equal to the target, update the minimum length found so far.

3. ** Shrink the Left Pointers:**
   - Move the `left` pointer to the right, subtracting the value of the element at the `left` position from `current_sum`.
   - Continue this process until `current_sum` is less than the target again.

4. **Repeat Steps 2 and 3:**
   - Continue expanding the right pointer and shrinking the left pointer until the `right` pointer reaches the end of the array.

5. **Return the Minimum Length:**
   - If a valid subarray is found, return the minimum length. Otherwise, return 0.

Here is the Python code implementing the above approach:
Response: python
def minSubarrayLength(target, nums):
    left, right = 0, 0
    current_sum = 0
    min_length = float('inf')

    while right < len(nums):
        current_sum += nums[right]
        while current_sum >= target:
            min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)
            current_sum -= nums[left]
            left += 1
        right += 1

    return min_length if min_length!= float('inf') else 0

# Example usage
target = 7
nums = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3]
print(minSubarrayLength(target, nums))  # Output: 2

Original Question: There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

*   For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return _the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses_. If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = \[\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** \[0,1\]
**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is \[0,1\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** numCourses = 4, prerequisites = \[\[1,0\],\[2,0\],\[3,1\],\[3,2\]\]
**Output:** \[0,2,1,3\]
**Explanation:** There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is \[0,1,2,3\]. Another correct ordering is \[0,2,1,3\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** numCourses = 1, prerequisites = \[\]

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a topological sort algorithm. Topological sort is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed graph such that for every directed edge `u -> v`, vertex `u` comes before `v` in the ordering. This problem can be represented as a directed graph where each course is a vertex and each prerequisite is a directed edge.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. ** Create a graph from the prerequisites:**
   - Initialize an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Initialize a list to keep track of the in-degrees (number of incoming edges) for each vertex.

2. ** Fill the adjacency list and in-degrees:**
   - For each prerequisite pair `[ai, bi]`, add an edge from `ai` to `bi` in the adjacency list and increment the in-degree of `bi`.

3. ** Find vertices with in-degree 0:**
   - These vertices have no prerequisites and can be taken first. Add them to a queue.

4. ** Perform topological sort:**
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Remove a vertex from the queue.
     - Add this vertex to the result list.
     - For each neighbor of the removed vertex, decrease its in-degree by 1.
     - If the in-degree of a neighbor becomes 0, add it to the queue.

5. ** Check if all vertices have been processed:**
   - If the result list has the same length as the number of courses, return the result list. Otherwise, return an empty array, indicating that it is impossible to finish all courses.

Here is the Python code implementing the above steps:
Response: python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def topological_sort(num_courses, prerequisites):
    # Create a graph and in-degrees
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    in_degrees = [0] * num_courses

    for ai, bi in prerequisites:
        graph[ai].append(bi)
        in_degrees[bi] += 1
    
    # Find vertices with in-degree 0

    # Perform topological sort

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a tree data structure where each node represents a character in a word. Each node will have children for each possible character, and we will use a special child for the dot character. When we add a word, we start at the root and follow the path corresponding to the characters in the word, creating new nodes for each character we encounter that doesn't already have a child. When we search for a word, we start at the root and follow the path corresponding to the characters in the word, but if we encounter a dot, we consider all possible children (i.e., all letters).

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find all possible words on the board. We will iterate through each cell on the board and check if we can form a word starting from that cell by moving to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) and checking if the word formed is in the list of words.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the DFS function**: The DFS function will take the current position on the board, the current word being formed, and the board itself. It will recursively explore all possible paths from the current position and check if the word formed is in the list of words.

2. **Initialize the result list**: Create an empty list to store all the words found on the board.

3. **Iterate through each cell on the board**: For each cell, check if it is within the bounds of the board and if it has not been used in the current word. If it meets these conditions, add it to the current word and recursively call the DFS function with the new position and the updated word. If the word formed is in the list of words, add it to the result list.

4. **Return the result list**: After iterating through all the cells, return the result list containing all the words found on the board.

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum amount of money that can be robbed without alerting the police. Since the houses are arranged in a circle, we cannot rob two adjacent houses. We can break down the problem into two subproblems: robing houses from the first to the second-to-last house, and robing houses from the second to the last house. The maximum amount of money we can robust is the maximum of these two subproblems.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the subproblems:**
   - Let `dp[i]` be the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from houses `1` to `i` without alerting the police.
   - We need to find `dp[n-1]` and `dp[n-2]` where `n` is the number of houses.

2. **Base cases:**
   - If there is only one house, the maximum amount of money that can be robbed is `nums[0]`.
   - If there are two houses, the maximum amount of money that can be robbed is the maximum of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`.

3. **Recurrence relation:**
   - For `i >= 3`, the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from houses `1` to `i` is the maximum of robing houses from `1` to `i-1` and robing houses from `2` to `i-1` plus the amount of money in house `i`. This can be written as:
     \[
     dp[i] = \max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])
     \]

4. **Calculate `dp[n-1]` and `dp[n-2]$:**
   - First, calculate `dp[i]` for `i` from `3` to `n-1` using the recurrence relation.
   - Then, find the maximum of `dp[n-1]` and `dp[n-2]`.

5. ** handling the circular arrangement:**
   - We need to consider two cases: robing houses from the first to the second-to-last house and robing houses from the second to the last house.
   - The maximum amount of money that can be robbed is the maximum of these two cases.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def max_robber_money(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Case 1: Robing houses from the first to the second-to-last house
    if n == 1:
        return nums[0]
    if n == 2:
        return max(nums[0], nums[1])
    
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = nums[0]
    dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])
    
    for i in range(2, n-1):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])
    
    # Case 2: Robing houses from the second to the last house
    dp2 = [0] * n
    dp2[1] = nums[1]
    dp2[2] = max(nums[1], nums[2])
    
    for i in range(3, n):
        dp2[i] = max(dp2[i-1], dp2[i-2] + nums[i])
    
    # The maximum amount of money that can be robbed is the maximum of the two cases
    return max(dp[n-2], dp2[n-1])

# Example usage
nums = [2, 3, 2]
print(max_robber_money(nums))  # Output: 3

nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
print(max_robber_money(nums))  # Output: 4

nums = [1, 2, 3]
print(max_robber_money(nums))  # Output: 3

CoT: To find the shortest palindrome that can be formed by adding characters in front of the given string `s`, we can use a method that involves finding the longest palindromic prefix of `s` and then adding the reverse of the remaining part of `s` to the front of `s`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Find the longest palindromic prefix:**
   - Start from the beginning of the string and check if the substring from the start to the current position is a palindrome.
   - Keep track of the length of the longest palindromic prefix found.

2. **Determine the remaining part of the string:**
   - Once we have the longest palindromic prefix, the remaining part of the string is the part that is not part of the palindromic prefix.

3. **Form the shortest palindrome:**
   - To form the shortest palindrome, we add the reverse of the remaining part to the front of the string.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def shortest_palindrome(s):
    n = len(s)
    longest_palindromic_prefix_length = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if is_palindrome(s[:i+1]):
            longest_palindromic_prefix_length = i + 1
    
    remaining_part = s[longest_palindromic_prefix_length:]
    reverse_remaining_part = remaining_part[::-1]
    
    shortest_palindrome = reverse_remaining_part + s
    
    return shortest_palindrome

# Example usage
s = "aacecaaa"
print(shortest_palindrome(s))  # Output: "aaacecaaa"

s = "abcd"
print(shortest_palindrome(s))  # Output: "dcbabcd"

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the_ `kth` _largest element in the array_.

Note that it is the `kth` largest element in the sorted order, not the `kth` distinct element.

You must solve it in `O(n)` time complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,1,5,6,4\], k = 2
**Output:** 5

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6\], k = 4
**Output:** 4

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the_ `kth` _largest element in the array_. Note that it is the `kth` largest element in the sorted order, not the `kth` distinct element. You must solve it in `O(n)` time complexity. **Example 1:** **Input:** nums = \[3,2,1,5,6,4\], k = 2 **Output:** 5 **Example 2:** **Input:** nums = \[3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6\], k = 4 **Output:** 4 **Constraints:** * `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105` * `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
CoT: To find the `kth` largest element in an integer array `nums` in `O(n)` time complexity, we can use the **_inches Sort** algorithm. The inches Sort algorithm is an efficient way to find the `kth` largest element in an array by partitioning the array around a pivot element such that all elements to the left of the pivot are less than or equal to the pivot, and all elements to the right of the pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the `kthLargest` function**: This function takes an integer array `nums` and an integer `k` as input and returns the `kth` largest element in the array.

2. **Convert `k` to a zero-indexed position**: Since Python uses zero-indexed arrays, we need to convert `k` to a zero-indexed position by subtracting 1 from it.

3. **Use the `iles Sort` algorithm**: The `iles Sort` algorithm works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the array around the pivot. We can use a ** partitions** function to do this. The `partitions` function will return the index of the pivot element after partitioning.

4. **Update the `k` value**: After partitioning the array, if the pivot element is at the `kth` position, we have found the `kth` largest element. If the pivot element is to the left of the `kth` position, we need to search in the right subarray by decreasing `k` by the number of elements to the left of the pivot. If the pivot element is to the right of the `kth` position, we need to search in the left subarray.

5. **Repeat the process**: Continue the process until the pivot element is at the `kth` position.

Here is the Python code to implement the solution:
Response: python
def partition(nums, left, right, pivot_index):
    pivot_value = nums[pivot_index]
    nums[pivot_index], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[pivot_index]
    store_index = left
    for i in range(left, right):
        if nums[i] <= pivot_value:
            nums[i], nums[store_index] = nums[store_index], nums[i]
            store_index += 1
    nums[store_index], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[store_index]
    return store_index

def kthLargest(nums, k):
    k = k - 1  # Convert k to zero-indexed position
    left = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1
    while left <= right:
        pivot_index = partition(nums, left, right, right)
        if pivot_index == k:
            return nums[pivot_index]
        elif pivot_index < k:
            left = pivot_index + 1
        else:
            right = pivot_index - 1
    return None

*   Only numbers `1` through `9` are used.
*   Each number is used **at most once**.

Return _a list of all possible valid combinations_. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

**Example 1:**

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all valid combinations of \( k \) numbers that sum up to \( n \) using numbers from 1 to 9, we can use a recursive approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Define the recursive function**: We need a function that takes the current sum, the current combination, the current position in the list of numbers, and the target sum \( n \). The function will explore all possible combinations by adding each number from 1 to 9 to the current combination if it doesn't exceed the target sum and if it hasn't been used yet.

2. **Base case**: If the current sum equals \( n \) and the length of the current combination equals \( k \), we have found a valid combination. Add this combination to the result list.

3. **Recursive case**: If the current sum is less than \( n \) and the current position is less than 9, we can add each number from the current position to the current combination and make a recursive call with the updated sum, the updated combination, the next position, and the target sum.

4. ** backtracking**: After making a recursive call, we need to remove the last number from the current combination to backtrack and try the next number.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def find_combinations(k, n, current_sum, current_combination, position, result):
    if current_sum == n and len(current_combination) == k:

                find_combinations(k, n, current_sum + i, current_combination, i + 1, result)

Original Question: A city's **skyline** is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return _the **skyline** formed by these buildings collectively_.

The geometric information of each building is given in the array `buildings` where `buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]`:

*   `lefti` is the x coordinate of the left edge of the `ith` building.
*   `righti` is the x coordinate of the right edge of the `ith` building.
*   `heighti` is the height of the `ith` building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`.

The **skyline** should be represented as a list of "key points " **sorted by their x-coordinate** in the form `[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

**Note:** There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]`

**Input:** buildings = \[\[2,9,10\],\[3,7,15\],\[5,12,12\],\[15,20,10\],\[19,24,8\]\]
**Output:** \[\[2,10\],\[3,15\],\[7,12\],\[12,0\],\[15,10\],\[20,8\],\[24,0\]\]
**Explanation:**
Figure A shows the buildings of the input.
Figure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in figure B represent the key points in the output list.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** buildings = \[\[0,2,3\],\[2,5,3\]\]

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` _if there are two **distinct indices**_ `i` _and_ `j` _in the array such that_ `nums[i] == nums[j]` _and_ `abs(i - j) <= k`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\], k = 3
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,0,1,1\], k = 1
**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1,2,3\], k = 2
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `0 <= k <= 105`
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` _if there are two **distinct indices**_ `i` _and_ `j` _in the array such that_ `nums[i] == nums[j]` _and_ `abs(i - j) <= k`. **Example 1:** **Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\], k = 3 **Output:** true **Example 2:** **Input:** nums = \[1,0,1,1\], k = 1 **Output:** true **Example 3:** **Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1,2,3\], k = 2 **Output:** false **Constraints:** * `1 <= nums.length <= 105` * `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109` * `0 <= k <= 105`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the last index at which each number appears. For each number in the array, we check if it has appeared before and if the difference between the current index and the last index is less than or equal to `k`. If such a pair of indices exists, we return `True`. Otherwise, we update the last index for that number and continue to the next element.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
def has XYZ_pair(nums, k):
    last_index = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if num in last_index and i - last_index[num] <= k:
            return True
        last_index[num] = i
    return False

# Test the function with the given examples

Original Question: You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `indexDiff` and `valueDiff`.

Find a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that:

*   `i != j`,
*   `abs(i - j) <= indexDiff`.
*   `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valueDiff`, and

Return `true` _if such pair exists or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\], indexDiff = 3, valueDiff = 0
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** We can choose (i, j) = (0, 3).
We satisfy the three conditions:
i != j --> 0 != 3
abs(i - j) <= indexDiff --> abs(0 - 3) <= 3
abs(nums\[i\] - nums\[j\]) <= valueDiff --> abs(1 - 1) <= 0

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,5,9,1,5,9\], indexDiff = 2, valueDiff = 3
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** After trying all the possible pairs (i, j), we cannot satisfy the three conditions, so we return false.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `1 <= indexDiff <= nums.length`
*   `0 <= valueDiff <= 109`

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a combination of a hash map and a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize a hash map**: The hash map will store each number in the array along with its index.

2. **Iterate through the array**: For each number `nums[i]` at index `i`, we will check if there exists another number `nums[j]` such that `abs(i - j) <= indexDiff` and `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valueDiff`.

3. **Check the hash map**: For each `nums[i]`, we will look for `nums[j]` in the hash map such that `j` is within the range `i - indexDiff` to `i + indexDiff` (inclusive) and `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valueDiff`. If such a `j` exists, we return `true`.

4. **Add the number to the hash map**: After checking for `nums[j]`, we add `nums[i]` to the hash map with its index `i`.

Here's the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
def find_pair(nums, index_diff, value_diff):
    num_to_index = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if num in num_to_index:

                    return True
        num_to_index[num] = i
    return False

CoT: To find the largest square containing only `1`'s in a given `m x n` binary matrix, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define a new matrix `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the side length of the largest square with its bottom-right corner at `(i, j)`.

The recurrence relation for `dp[i][j]` is:
\[ dp[i][j] = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
\min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1 & \text{if } matrix[i][j] = 1 
\end{cases} \]

We will iterate through the matrix and fill in the `dp` matrix accordingly. The maximum value in the `dp` matrix will be the side length of the largest square containing only `1`'s. The area of this square will be the square of this maximum value.

CoT: To determine the number of nodes in a complete binary tree given its root, we can use the property that a complete binary tree with height \( h \) has between \( 2^h \) and \( 2^{h+1} - 1 \) nodes. We can find the height of the tree by counting the number of edges from the root to the farthest leaf node. The height \( h \) can be determined by the number of levels in the tree, which is the number of edges plus one.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. **Determine the height of the tree**: Start from the root and count the number of edges down to the farthest leaf node. This can be done by traversing the tree in a depth-first search (DFS) manner or by using a level order traversal. However, a more efficient way is to use the property of binary trees that the height can be found by counting the number of times we can divide the height by 2 until we reach 1.

2. **Calculate the number of nodes**: Once we have the height \( h \), we can calculate the number of nodes in the tree. If the tree is a complete binary tree, it will have \( 2^h - 1 \) nodes if the last level is not completely filled, or \( 2^{h+1} - 1 \) nodes if the last level is completely filled.

Here is the Python code to implement this algorithm:
Response: python
def count_nodes(root):
    if root is None:
        return 0
    
    # Determine the height of the tree
    height = 0

        root = root left
        height += 1
    
    # Calculate the number of nodes in the tree
    if root:
        return 2 ** height - 1
    else:
        return 2 ** (height + 1) - 1

CoT: To solve the problem of evaluating a string representing a valid mathematical expression without using the built-in `eval()` function, we can use a stack to handle the order of operations and parentheses. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. ** Initialize a stack to store the numbers and operators.**
2. ** Initialize a variable to keep track of the current number being read.**
3. ** Iterate through each character in the string:**
   - If the character is a digit, update the current number.
   - If the character is an operator, push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a left parenthesis, push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a right parenthesis, pop the top of the stack until the corresponding left parenthesis is found, and then pop the left parenthesis.
4. ** After processing all characters, pop the stack until it is empty, and sum the numbers with the appropriate signs.**

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:

def calculate(s):
    # Initialize the stack and the current number

    current_number = 0
    operation = '+'

Original Question: Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (`push`, `top`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyStack` class:

*   `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
*   `int pop()` Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
*   `int top()` Returns the element on the top of the stack.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the stack is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

*   You must use **only** standard operations of a queue, which means that only `push to back`, `peek/pop from front`, `size` and `is empty` operations are valid.
*   Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "MyStack ",  "push ",  "push ",  "top ",  "pop ",  "empty "\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 2, 2, false\]

**Explanation**
MyStack myStack = new MyStack();
myStack.push(1);
myStack.push(2);
myStack.top(); // return 2
myStack.pop(); // return 2
myStack.empty(); // return False

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= x <= 9`
*   At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `empty`.
*   All the calls to `pop` and `top` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the stack using only one queue?

CoT: To implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues, we can use the following approach:

1. ** push(x) **: Add the element `x` to the back of the first queue.
2. ** top() **: Move all elements from the first queue to the second queue except the last element, then return the last element.
3. ** pop() **: Move all elements from the first queue to the second queue except the last element, then remove the last element from the second queue.
4. ** empty() **: Check if both queues are empty.

Here is the Python code for the implementation:
Response: python
from collections import deque

class My_stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self queue1 = deque()
        self queue2 = deque()

        return self queue2.pop()

    def empty(self):
        return not self queue1 and not self queue2

# Example usage

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
CoT: To invert a binary tree, we need to swap the left and right children of each node. We can achieve this using a recursive approach. Here's the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. **Define the function**: Create a function ` invert_tree` that takes the root of the binary tree as an argument and returns the root of the inverted tree.

2. **Base case**: If the root is `None`, return `None`. This handles the case when the tree is empty.

3. **Swap the children**: Swap the left and right children of the current root.

4. **Recursive call**: Recursively call ` invert_tree` on the left and right children of the current root.

5. **Return the root**: After the recursive calls, return the root.

Here's the Python code implementing the above steps:

CoT: To evaluate the given expression represented by the string `s`, we can use a simple algorithm that iterates through the string and handles the operations as they appear. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable `result` to store the final answer.

3. Initialize a variable `current_operation` to store the current operation being performed.
4. Iterate through each character in the string `s`.
5. If the character is a digit, update `current_number` by appending the digit.
6. If the character is an operator, perform the operation on `current_number` and `result` using the current `current_operation` and update `result` accordingly. Then, reset `current_number` to 0 and update `current_operation`.

This algorithm is efficient and works in linear time with constant space complexity. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. ** Initialize two variables ** `count1` and `count2` to keep track of the counts of the two potential majority elements. Also, initialize two variables ` elements1` and ` elements2` to store the elements themselves.
2. ** Iterate through the array ** and update the counts and elements accordingly:
   - If `count1` is 0, set ` elements1` to the current element and `count1` to 1.
   - If `count2` is 0, set ` elements2` to the current element and `count2` to 1.
   - If the current element is equal to ` elements1`, increment `count1`.
   - If the current element is equal to ` elements2`, increment `count2`.
   - If the current element is different from both ` elements1` and ` elements2`, decrement both `count1` and `count2`.
3. ** Check the counts ** after iterating through the array:
   - If `count1` is greater than ` floor(n/3)`, then ` elements1` is a majority element.
   - If `count2` is greater than ` floor(n/3)`, then ` elements2` is a majority element.
4. ** Return the majority elements **.

CoT: To find the \( k \)-th smallest value in a binary search tree (BST), we can use an in-order traversal approach. In an in-order traversal, the values of the nodes are visited in ascending order. We can use a stack to keep track of the nodes we have visited so far and count them until we reach the \( k \)-th node.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Start with the root of the tree.
3. While the stack is not empty or the root is not None:
   - If the root is not None, push the root onto the stack and move to the left child.
   - If the root is None, pop the stack and move to the right child.
   - If the stack size is equal to \( k \), the top of the stack is the \( k \)-th smallest value.

*   `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

*   You must use **only** standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
*   Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "MyQueue ",  "push ",  "push ",  "peek ",  "pop ",  "empty "\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 1, 1, false\]

**Explanation**
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: \[1\]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: \[1, 2\] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is \[2\]
myQueue.empty(); // return false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= x <= 9`
*   At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`.
*   All the calls to `pop` and `peek` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the queue such that each operation is **[amortized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis)** `O(1)` time complexity? In other words, performing `n` operations will take overall `O(n)` time even if one of those operations may take longer.
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`). Implement the `MyQueue` class: * `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue. * `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it. * `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue. * `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise. **Notes:** * You must use **only** standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid. * Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations. **Example 1:** **Input** \[ "MyQueue ", "push ", "push ", "peek ", "pop ", "empty "\] \[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\] **Output** \[null, null, null, 1, 1, false\] **Explanation** MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue(); myQueue.push(1); // queue is: \[1\] myQueue.push(2); // queue is: \[1, 2\] (leftmost is front of the queue) myQueue.peek(); // return 1 myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is \[2\] myQueue.empty(); // return false **Constraints:** * `1 <= x <= 9` * At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`. * All the calls to `pop` and `peek` are valid. **Follow-up:** Can you implement the queue such that each operation is **[amortized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis)** `O(1)` time complexity? In other words, performing `n` operations will take overall `O(n)` time even if one of those operations may take longer.
CoT: To implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks, we can use one stack to represent the front of the queue and the other stack to represent the back of the queue. Here's how we can do it:

1. **Push**: To push an element `x` to the back of the queue, we simply push `x` onto the back stack.
2. **Pop**: To pop an element from the front of the queue, we need to check if the front stack is empty. If it is empty, we need to move all elements from the back stack to the front stack. Then, we pop the top element from the front stack.
3. **Peek**: To peek at the element at the front of the queue, we check if the front stack is empty. If it is empty, we need to move all elements from the back stack to the front stack. Then, we return the top element from the front stack.
4. **Empty**: To check if the queue is empty, we check if both the front stack and the back stack are empty.

Here is the Python code to implement the `My Queue` class:
Response: python
class My Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self_front = []
        self_back = []

            while self_back:

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
CoT: To solve the problem of counting the total quantity of digit `1` appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to `n`, we can use a systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Convert the number to a string**: This allows us to iterate over each digit of the number.
2. **Count the occurrences of the digit `1` in the string representation of `n`**: This gives us the count of `1`s in the number itself.
3. **Count the occurrences of the digit `1` in all numbers less than `n`**: We can break this down by considering each digit position from the most significant to the least significant.

For each digit position, we can calculate the number of times `1` appears in that position by considering the following:
- If the digit at the current position is `0`, then `1` does not appear in that position.
- If the digit at the current position is `1`, then `1` appears in that position for all combinations of the remaining digits.
- If the digit at the current position is greater than `1`, then `1` appears in that position for all combinations of the remaining digits.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def count_digit_one(n):
    count = 0
    str_n = str(n)
    length = len(str_n)
    
    for i in range(length):
        power_of_ten = 10 ** (length - i - 1)
        digit = int(str_n[i])
        if digit == 0:
            continue
        elif digit == 1:
            count += power_of_ten
        else:
            count += power_of_ten * digit
    
    return count

CoT: To determine if a given singly linked list is a palindrome, we can follow these steps:

1. **Find the middle of the list**: Use the two-pointer technique where one pointer moves twice as fast as the other. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle.
2. **Reverse the second half of the list**: Starting from the middle, reverse the elements of the second half.
3. **Compare the first half with the reversed second half**: If the values of the corresponding elements are the same, the list is a palindrome.

Original Question: Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**)."

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5\], p = 2, q = 8
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5\], p = 2, q = 4
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Example 3:**

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.

*   `p` and `q` will exist in the BST.

CoT: To find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in a binary search tree (BST), we can use the properties of a BST. In a BST, for any node, all nodes in its left子 are less than the node, and all nodes in its right子 are greater than the node. We can use this property to find the LCA.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm to find the LCA:

1. Start from the root of the tree.
2. If both nodes `p` and `q` are less than the root, move to the left child of the root.
3. If both nodes `p` and `q` are greater than the root, move to the right child of the root.
4. If one node is less than the root and the other is greater than the root, then the root is the LCA.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self val = val
        self left = left
        self right = right

def find_LCA(root, p, q):
    while root:
        if p < root val and q < root val:
            root = root left

            root = root right
        else:
            return root
    return None

# Example usage

Original Question: There is a singly-linked list `head` and we want to delete a node `node` in it.

You are given the node to be deleted `node`. You will **not be given access** to the first node of `head`.

All the values of the linked list are **unique**, and it is guaranteed that the given node `node` is not the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

*   The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
*   The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
*   All the values before `node` should be in the same order.
*   All the values after `node` should be in the same order.

**Custom testing:**

*   For the input, you should provide the entire linked list `head` and the node to be given `node`. `node` should not be the last node of the list and should be an actual node in the list.
*   We will build the linked list and pass the node to your function.
*   The output will be the entire list after calling your function.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[4,5,1,9\], node = 5
**Output:** \[4,1,9\]
**Explanation:** You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

*   The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
*   The value of each node in the list is **unique**.

CoT: To solve the problem of deleting a node from a singly linked list without being given access to the first node, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the node to be deleted**: We are given the node `node` to be deleted.
2. **Set the next value of the node before the node to be deleted**: Since we don't have access to the first node, we need to find the node before the node to be deleted. We can do this by iterating from the head of the list to the node to be deleted. Once we find the node before the node to be deleted, we set its next value to the next node of the node to be deleted.
3. **Remove the node to be deleted**: After setting the next value of the node before the node to be deleted, we can remove the node to be deleted by updating the next value of the node to be deleted to `None`.

Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given an integer array `nums`, return _an array_ `answer` _such that_ `answer[i]` _is equal to the product of all the elements of_ `nums` _except_ `nums[i]`. The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer. You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation. **Example 1:** **Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,4\] **Output:** \[24,12,8,6\] **Example 2:** **Input:** nums = \[-1,1,0,-3,3\] **Output:** \[0,0,9,0,0\] **Constraints:** * `2 <= nums.length <= 105` * `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30` * The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer. **Follow up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity? (The output array **does not** count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the product of all elements in an array except the element at each position without using division, we can use a two pass approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **First Pass: Calculate the prefix product**
   - Initialize a variable `prefix_product` to 1.
   - Iterate through the array from left to right.
   - For each element, multiply the current `prefix_product` by the element and update the `prefix_product`.
   - Store the current `prefix_product` in the result array at the current index.

2. **Second Pass: Calculate the suffix product**
   - Initialize a variable ` suffix_product` to 1.
   - Iterate through the array from right to left.
   - For each element, multiply the current ` suffix_product` by the element and update the ` suffix_product`.
   - Multiply the current element in the result array by the current ` suffix_product` and update the result array.

This approach ensures that each element in the result array is the product of all elements to its left and all elements to its right.

Here is the Python code to implement this approach:
Response: python
def product except itself(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    result = [1] * n  # Initialize result array with 1s

    # First pass: Calculate the prefix product
    prefix_product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        result[i] = prefix_product
        prefix_product *= nums[i]

    # Second pass: Calculate the suffix product
    suffix_product = 1
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        result[i] *= suffix_product
        suffix_product *= nums[i]

    return result

Original Question: You are given an array of integers `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return _the max sliding window_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7\], k = 3
**Output:** \[3,3,5,5,6,7\]
**Explanation:** 
Window position                Max

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
*   `1 <= k <= nums.length`

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the maximum element in a sliding window of size `k` in an array `nums`, we can use a double-ended queue (deque) to keep track of the maximum element in the current window. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize the deque**: Start with an empty deque.
2. **Iterate through the array**: For each element in the array, do the following:
   - While the deque is not empty and the current element is greater than the element at the back of the deque, remove the element at the back of the deque.
   - Add the current element to the back of the deque.
   - If the current index is greater than or equal to `k-1`, the front of the deque contains the maximum element in the current window. Add this maximum element to the result list.
   - If the front of the deque is outside the current window (i.e., the current index is greater than the index of the front element), remove the front element from the deque.

*   Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
*   Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** matrix = \[\[1,4,7,11,15\],\[2,5,8,12,19\],\[3,6,9,16,22\],\[10,13,14,17,24\],\[18,21,23,26,30\]\], target = 5

2. ** Binary search within the matrix:**
   - While `row < m` and `col < n`, do the following:
     - If `matrix[row][col] == target`, return `true`.
     - If `matrix[row][col] < target`, move to the next column by incrementing `col`.
     - If `matrix[row][col] > target`, move to the previous row by decrementing `row`.

   - If `row` becomes negative or `col` becomes `n`, it means we have reached the end of the matrix without finding the target. Return `false`.

Original Question: Given a string `expression` of numbers and operators, return _all possible results from computing all the different possible ways to group numbers and operators_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

The test cases are generated such that the output values fit in a 32-bit integer and the number of different results does not exceed `104`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** expression =  "2-1-1 "
**Output:** \[0,2\]
**Explanation:**
((2-1)-1) = 0 
(2-(1-1)) = 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** expression =  "2\*3-4\*5 "

1. **Define the function**: Create a function ` evaluate expressions` that takes a string `expression` as input and returns a list of all possible results.

2. **Base case**: If the length of `expression` is 1, it is a single digit. Convert it to an integer and return a list containing this single digit.

3. **Recursive case**: If the length of `expression` is greater than 1, iterate through the string to find all possible positions to split the expression into two parts. For each split, recursively evaluate the two parts and combine the results using the operator at the split position.

4. **Combine results**: For each pair of results from the two parts, apply the operator at the split position to combine them. Add the result to a list.

5. **Return the list**: After iterating through all possible splits, return the list of all possible results.

Original Question: Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if_ `t` _is an anagram of_ `s`_, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Input:** s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

How would you adapt your solution to such a case?
CoT: To determine if two strings `s` and `t` are anagrams, we can use a frequency count approach. We will count the frequency of each character in both strings and then compare these counts. If the counts for all characters are the same, then the strings are anagrams.

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. Create a frequency count of each character in string `s`.
2. Create a frequency count of each character in string `t`.
3. Compare the frequency counts of `s` and `t`. If they are the same, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def is_anagram(s, t):
    # Create frequency counts for s and t
    from collections import Counter
    s_count = Counter(s)
    t_count = Counter(t)
    
    # Compare the frequency counts
    return s_count == t_count

# Example usage
s1 = "anagram"
t1 = "nagaram"
print(is_anagram(s1, t1))  # Output: True

s2 = "rat"

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the shortest distance between two different strings in a given array, we can use a combination of a **k-d tree** (specifically, a ** ball tree** or **R tree**), which is an efficient data structure for spatial data and can also be adapted for string data by considering the strings as points in a high-dimensional space. However, since the strings are of fixed length and consist of lowercase English letters, we can use a simpler approach using a **hash table** and **binary search**.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the data structure:**
   - Create a **hash table** to store the indices of the strings in the array.
   - Iterate through the array and store the index of each string in the hash table.

2. **Implement the `shortest` method:**
   - Check if `word1` and `word2` are in the hash table.
   - If either word is not in the hash table, return an error or an appropriate value indicating an error.
   - If both words are in the hash table, calculate the distance between their indices.
   - Use binary search to find the minimum distance between the indices.

Original Question: Given an array of strings `wordsDict` and two strings that already exist in the array `word1` and `word2`, return _the shortest distance between the occurrence of these two words in the list_.

**Note** that `word1` and `word2` may be the same. It is guaranteed that they represent **two individual words** in the list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** wordsDict = \["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"\], word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** wordsDict = \["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"\], word1 = "makes", word2 = "makes"
**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= wordsDict.length <= 105`
*   `1 <= wordsDict[i].length <= 10`
*   `wordsDict[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
*   `word1` and `word2` are in `wordsDict`.
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given an array of strings `wordsDict` and two strings that already exist in the array `word1` and `word2`, return _the shortest distance between the occurrence of these two words in the list_. **Note** that `word1` and `word2` may be the same.

CoT: To find the shortest distance between the occurrence of two words in an array of strings, we can use a two-pointer approach. We will iterate through the array and keep track of the last positions where `word1` and `word2` were found. The shortest distance between the two words will be the minimum difference between these two positions.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize two variables `last_word1` and `last_word2` to -1. These variables will store the last positions of `word1` and `word2` respectively.
2. Iterate through the array `wordsDict`.
3. For each word in the array, check if it is equal to `word1` or `word2`.
4. If the word is equal to `word1`, update `last_word1` to the current index.
5. If the word is equal to `word2`, update `last_word2` to the current index.
6. After updating `last_word1` or `last_word2`, calculate the absolute difference between `last_word1` and `last_word2`.
7. Keep track of the minimum difference found so far.
8. After iterating through the entire array, return the minimum difference.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def shortest_distance(wordsDict, word1, word2):
    last_word1 = -1
    last_word2 = -1
    min_distance = float('inf')
    
    for i, word in enumerate(wordsDict):
        if word == word1:
            last_word1 = i
        elif word == word2:
            last_word2 = i
        
        if last_word1!= -1 and last_word2!= -1:
            distance = abs(last_word1 - last_word2)
            min_distance = min(min_distance, distance)
    
    return min_distance

# Example 1
wordsDict1 = ["practice", " makes", "perfect", "coding", " makes"]
word1_1 = " makes"
word2_1 = "coding"
print(shortest_distance(wordsDict1, word1_1, word2_1))  # Output: 1

Original Question: Given a string `num` which represents an integer, return `true` _if_ `num` _is a **strobogrammatic number**_.

A **strobogrammatic number** is a number that looks the same when rotated `180` degrees (looked at upside down).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num =  "69 "
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num =  "88 "
**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

**Input:** num =  "962 "
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num.length <= 50`
*   `num` consists of only digits.
*   `num` does not contain any leading zeros except for zero itself.
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given a string `num` which represents an integer, return `true` _if_ `num` _is a **strobogrammatic number**_. A **strobogrammatic number** is a quantity that looks the same when rotated `180` degrees (looked at upside down). **Example 1:** **Input:** num = "69 " **Output:** true **Example 2:** **Input:** num = "88 " **Output:** true **Example 3:** **Input:** num = "962 " **Output:** false **Constraints:** * `1 <= num.length <= 50` * `num` consists of only digits. * `num` does not contain any leading zeros except for zero itself.
CoT: To determine if a given string `num` is a strobogrammic number, we need to check if it looks the same when rotated 180 degrees. This means that each digit in the string must have a corresponding digit that looks the same when rotated. The digits that satisfy this condition are 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9. Specifically:
- 0 rotated 180 degrees is 0.
- 1 rotated 180 degrees is 1.
- 6 rotated 180 degrees is 9.
- 8 rotated 180 degrees is 8.
- 9 rotated 180 degrees is 6.

We can solve this problem by iterating through the string from both ends towards the center and comparing the corresponding digits. If the digits are not one of the pairs (0, 0), (1, 1), (6, 9), (8, 8), or (9, 6), then the number is not a strobogrammic number.

Original Question: Given an integer `n`, return all the **strobogrammatic numbers** that are of length `n`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

A **strobogrammatic number** is a number that looks the same when rotated `180` degrees (looked at upside down).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** \["11","69","88","96"\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** \["0","1","8"\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 14`
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given an integer `n`, return all the **strobogrammatic numbers** that are of length `n`. You may return the answer in **any order**. A **strobogrammatic number** is a quantity that looks the same when rotated `180` degrees (looked at upside down). **Example 1:** **Input:** n = 2 **Output:** \["11","69","88","96"\] **Example 2:** **Input:** n = 1 **Output:** \["0","1","8"\] **Constraints:** * `1 <= n <= 14`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding all strobogrammic numbers of length `n`, we need to consider the digits that look the same when rotated 180 degrees. These digits are `0`, `1`, `8`, `6`, and `9`. Specifically, `6` and `9` swap places when rotated, while `0`, `1`, and `8` remain the same.

We can use a recursive approach to generate all strobogrammic numbers of length `n`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Base Case**: If `n` is 1, the strobogrammic numbers are simply the digits `0`, `1`, and `8`.
2. **Recursive Case**: If `n` is greater than 1, we can break down the problem into smaller subproblems. For a number of length `n`, the first and last digits must be one of the pairs `(0, 0)`, `(1, 1)`, or `(8, 8)` (since `0` cannot be the first digit). The remaining `n-2` digits must form a strobogrammic number of length `n-2`.

Let's implement this approach in Python:
Response: python
def generate_strobogrammic_numbers(n):
    if n == 1:
        return ["0", "1", "8"]
    
    # Recursive case: generate strobogrammic numbers of length n-2
    smaller_numbers = generate_strobogrammic_numbers(n-2)
    
    # Construct strobogrammic numbers of length n
    strobogrammic_numbers = []
    for num in smaller_numbers:

Original Question: We can shift a string by shifting each of its letters to its successive letter.

*   For example, `"abc "` can be shifted to be `"bcd "`.

We can keep shifting the string to form a sequence.

*   For example, we can keep shifting `"abc "` to form the sequence: `"abc " -> "bcd " -> ... -> "xyz "`.

Given an array of strings `strings`, group all `strings[i]` that belong to the same shifting sequence. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strings = \["abc","bcd","acef","xyz","az","ba","a","z"\]
**Output:** \[\["acef"\],\["a","z"\],\["abc","bcd","xyz"\],\["az","ba"\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strings = \["a"\]
**Output:** \[\["a"\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= strings.length <= 200`
*   `1 <= strings[i].length <= 50`
*   `strings[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

CoT: To solve the problem of grouping strings that belong to the same shifting sequence, we can use a systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Define a function to shift a string**: We need a function that takes a string and shifts each of its letters to its successive letter. For example, "abc" would become "bcd".

2. **Generate all possible shifts for each string**: For each string in the array, we generate all possible shifts until we reach a string that has already been seen. This will give us the complete shifting sequence for each string.

3. **Group the strings based on their shifting sequences**: We use a dictionary to group the strings based on their shifting sequences. The key of the dictionary will be a tuple representing the shifting sequence, and the value will be a list of strings that belong to that sequence.

4. **Return the grouped sequences**: Finally, we return the values of the dictionary as a list of lists.

Here's the Python code that implements this solution:

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the number of **uni-value**_ _subtrees_.

A **uni-value subtree** means all nodes of the subtree have the same value.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[5,1,5,5,5,null,5\]
**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[\]
**Output:** 0

**Example 3:**

**Output:** 6

**Constraints:**

*   The number of the node in the tree will be in the range `[0, 1000]`.
*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the quantity of **uni-value**_ _subtrees_. A **uni-value subtree** means all nodes of the subtree have the same value. **Example 1:** **Input:** root = \[5,1,5,5,5,null,5\] **Output:** 4 **Example 2:** **Input:** root = \[\] **Output:** 0 **Example 3:** **Input:** root = \[5,5,5,5,5,null,5\] **Output:** 6 **Constraints:** * The quantity of the node in the tree will be in the range `[0, 1000]`. * `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the quantity of uni-value subtrees in a binary tree, we can use a recursive approach. We'll define a function that visits each node of the tree and checks if the subtree rooted at that node is uni-value. If it is, we increment a counter. We then recursively apply the same process to the left and right children of the node.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Define the function**: Let's call the function `count_uni_value_subtrees`. It takes a `root` node as its input and returns the count of uni-value subtrees.

2. **Base case**: If the root is `None`, it means we've reached a leaf node or a null node, and there are no subtrees to consider. In this case, we return 0.

3. **Check if the current node is a uni-value node**: We need to check if all the nodes in the subtree rooted at the current node have the same value. We can do this by comparing the value of the current node with the values of its left and right children (if they exist).

4. **Recursive calls**: If the current node is a uni-value node, we recursively call `count_uni_value_subtrees` on its left and right children and add the results to our counter. If it's not a uni-value node, we simply make the recursive calls and do not increment the counter.

Here's the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
def count_uni_value_subtrees(root):
    if root is None:
        return 0

Original Question: Design an iterator to flatten a 2D vector. It should support the `next` and `hasNext` operations.

Implement the `Vector2D` class:

*   `Vector2D(int[][] vec)` initializes the object with the 2D vector `vec`.
*   `next()` returns the next element from the 2D vector and moves the pointer one step forward. You may assume that all the calls to `next` are valid.
*   `hasNext()` returns `true` if there are still some elements in the vector, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "Vector2D ",  "next ",  "next ",  "next ",  "hasNext ",  "hasNext ",  "next ",  "hasNext "\]
\[\[\[\[1, 2\], \[3\], \[4\]\]\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, 1, 2, 3, true, true, 4, false\]

**Explanation**
Vector2D vector2D = new Vector2D(\[\[1, 2\], \[3\], \[4\]\]);
vector2D.next();    // return 1
vector2D.next();    // return 2
vector2D.next();    // return 3
vector2D.hasNext(); // return True
vector2D.hasNext(); // return True
vector2D.next();    // return 4
vector2D.hasNext(); // return False

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= vec.length <= 200`
*   `0 <= vec[i].length <= 500`
*   `-500 <= vec[i][j] <= 500`
*   At most `105` calls will be made to `next` and `hasNext`.

You may assume that all the calls to `next` are valid. * `hasNext()` returns `true` if there are still some elements in the vector, and `false` otherwise. **Example 1:** **Input** \[ "Vector2D ", "next ", "next ", "next ", "hasNext ", "hasNext ", "next ", "hasNext "\] \[\[\[\[1, 2\], \[3\], \[4\]\]\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\] **Output** \[null, 1, 2, 3, true, true, 4, false\] **Explanation** Vector2D vector2D = new Vector2D(\[\[1, 2\], \[3\], \[4\]\]); vector2D.next(); // return 1 vector2D.next(); // return 2 vector2D.next(); // return 3 vector2D.hasNext(); // return True vector2D.hasNext(); // return True vector2D.next(); // return 4 vector2D.hasNext(); // return False **Constraints:** * `0 <= vec.length <= 200` * `0 <= vec[i].length <= 500` * `-500 <= vec[i][j] <= 500` * At most `105` calls will be made to `next` and `hasNext`. **Follow up:** As an added challenge, try to code it using only [iterators in C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/iterator/) or [iterators in Java](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html).
CoT: To solve the problem of designing an iterator to flat a 2D vector, we can use a combination of a 2D array and a 1D array to simulate the iteration process. Here's a step-by-step solution in Python:

1. **Initialize the iterator:**
   - Create a 1D array to store all the elements of the 2D vector in a flat manner.
   - Iterate through the 2D vector and fill the 1D array with all the elements.

2. **Implement the `next` method:**
   - Use a index variable to keep track of the current position in the 1D array.
   - When `next` is called, return the element at the current index and increment the index.

3. **Implement the `hasNext` method:**
   - Check if the current index is less than the length of the 1D array. If it is, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

Here's the Python code for the `Vector2D` class:
Response: python
def __init__(self, vec):
    self(vec)
    self_flat = []
    for row in vec:
        for element in row:
            self_flat.append(element)
    self_index = 0

def next(self):
    if self_index < len(self_flat):
        return self_flat self_index]
        self_index += 1
    else:
        return None

def hasNext(self):
    return self_index < len(self_flat)

CoT: To determine if a person can attend all meetings given an array of meeting intervals, we need to check if there is any overlap between the intervals. If there is any overlap, the person cannot attend all meetings. Here is a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
CoT: To determine the minimum number of conference rooms required, we need to analyze the intervals and find the maximum number of overlapping intervals at any given time. This can be done by sorting the intervals based on their start times and then using a variable to keep track of the number of overlapping intervals.

Here is the step-by-step Python code to solve the problem:

1. Sort the intervals based on their start times.
2. Initialize a variable ` overlapping` to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of overlapping intervals.
3. Initialize a variable ` rooms` to 0. This variable will keep track of the minimum number of conference rooms required.
4. Iterate through the sorted intervals. For each interval, check if it overlaps with any of the previous intervals. If it does, increment the ` overlapping` variable. Otherwise, reset it to 1.
5. Update the ` rooms` variable by taking the maximum of the current ` rooms` and the ` overlapping` variable.
6. After iterating through all the intervals, return the ` rooms` variable.

Here is the Python code:
Response: python
def min_conference_rooms(intervals):
    intervals.sort()
    overlapping = 0
    rooms = 0

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all possible combinations of factors of a given integer \( n \), we can use a recursive approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Base Case**: If \( n \) is 1, there are no factors in the range \([2, n-1]\), so we return an empty list.
2. **Recursive Case**: If \( n \) is greater than 1, we start by finding the smallest factor of \( n \) (which is 2). We then recursively find all factor combinations of \( n \) divided by this factor. We also need to consider the case where the factor is greater than 2 and is a factor of \( n \), and include it in the combinations.
3. **Combining Results**: We combine the results from the recursive calls to form all possible factor combinations of \( n \).

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:

CoT: To determine if a given array of unique integers is a correct preorder traversal sequence of a binary search tree (BST), we can use a stack to simulate the process of遍历 the tree. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize a stack and a variable `root` to store the root of the current子 tree.**
2. ** Iterate through the `preorder` array.**
   - If the current element is less than the `root`, it should be placed in the left sub tree.推 it onto the stack.
   - If the current element is greater than the `root`, it should be placed in the right sub tree. Check if the stack is empty or the top of the stack is less than the current element. If it is, it's valid; otherwise, it's invalid.
   - Update the `root` to the current element.
3. ** After iterating through the entire array, check if the stack is empty. If it is, all elements have been correctly placed in the tree. If not, there are elements left that have not been placed, which means the sequence is invalid.

Original Question: There is a row of `n` houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x 3` cost matrix `costs`.

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to paint the first `i` houses such that the `i`-th house is painted with color `j`. The colors are represented as 0 (red), 1 (blue), and 2 (green).

The recurrence relation for `dp[i][j]` is:
\[ dp[i][j] = \min(dp[i-1][k]) + costs[i][j} \]
where `k` is a color different from `j` (i.e., if `j` is 0, `k` can be 1 or 2; if `j` is 1, `k` can be 0 or 2; if `j` is 2, `k` can be 0 or 1).

We initialize `dp[0][j]` with the cost of painting the first house with color `j`. Then, we iterate through each house from 1 to `n-1` and update `dp[i][j]` based on the recurrence relation.

Finally, the minimum cost to paint all houses is the minimum value among `dp[n-1][0]`, `dp[n-1][1]`, and `dp[n-1][2]`.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:

CoT: To solve the problem of repeatedly adding the digits of an integer `num` until the result has only one digit, we can use the concept of the digital root. The digital root of a number is the value obtained by an iterative process of summing digits, on each iteration using the result from the previous iteration to compute a digit sum. The digital root of a non-zero integer is the single digit number that is equivalent to the original number modulo 9, with the exception that the digital root of 9 is 9.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. If `num` is 0, the digital root is 0.
2. If `num` is not 0, the digital root is `num % 9` if `num % 9` is not 0. If `num % 9` is 0, the digital root is 9.

This works because the sum of the digits of a number is congruent to the number itself modulo 9. Therefore, repeatedly summing the digits of a number until a single digit is obtained will result in a number that is congruent to the original number modulo 9.

Here is the Python code to find the digital root of a given number `num`:
Response: python
def digital_root(num):
    if num == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return num % 9 if num % 9!= 0 else 9

*   `0 <= n <= 3500`
*   `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
*   `-100 <= target <= 100`
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given an array of `n` integers `nums` and an integer `target`, determine the quantity of index triplets `i`, `j`, `k` with `0 <= i < j < k < n` that satisfy the condition `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target`. **Example 1:** **Input:** nums = \[-2,0,1,3\], target = 2 **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2: \[-2,0,1\] \[-2,0,3\] **Example 2:** **Input:** nums = \[\], target = 0 **Output:** 0 **Example 3:** **Input:** nums = \[0\], target = 0 **Output:** 0 **Constraints:** * `n == nums.length` * `0 <= n <= 3500` * `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100` * `-100 <= target <= 100`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of index triplets \(i\), \(j\), \(k\) with \(0 \le i < j < k < n\) such that \(nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target\), we can use a combination of sorting and a two-pointer approach. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Sort the array**: First, we sort the array `nums` in non-decreasing order. This will allow us to use the two-pointer approach efficiently.

2. **Iterate through the array**: We iterate through the array with a loop where the index \(i\) goes from 0 to \(n-3\) (since \(i < j < k\), \(i\) must be at most \(n-3\)).

3. **Fix the first element**: For each fixed \(i\), we need to find pairs \((j, k)\) such that \(nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target\). This can be rewritten as \(nums[j] + nums[k] < target - nums[i]\).

4. **Use two-pointers**: We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to find pairs \((j, k)\) that satisfy the condition \(nums[j] + nums[k] < target - nums[i]\). The `left` pointer starts at \(i+1\) and the `right` pointer starts at \(n-1\). We move the `left` pointer to the right and the `right` pointer to the left until they meet or the condition is no longer satisfied.

5. **Count valid pairs**: For each valid pair \((j, k)\), we increment the count of valid triplets by the number of positions the `left` pointer has moved. This is because each position the `left` pointer moves to the right corresponds to a new valid pair \((j, k)\).

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
def count_triplets(nums, target):
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n-3):
        left, right = i+1, n-1
        while left < right:
            if nums[left] + nums[right] < target - nums[i]:
                count += right - left
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
    return count

# Example usage
nums1 = [-2, 0, 1, 3]
target1 = 2
print(count_triplets(nums1, target1))  # Output: 2

nums2 = []
target2 = 0

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in **any order**.

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear runtime complexity and uses only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,1,3,2,5\]
**Output:** \[3,5\]
**Explanation: ** \[5, 3\] is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[-1,0\]
**Output:** \[-1,0\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1\]
**Output:** \[1,0\]

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
*   Each integer in `nums` will appear twice, only two integers will appear once.

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use the properties of the XOR operation. The XOR of a number with itself is 0, and the XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself. Therefore, if we XOR all the numbers in the array, the result will be the XOR of the two unique numbers, since all the other numbers will cancel out.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable `x` to 0.
2. Iterate through the array `nums` and XOR each element with `x`. After this step, `x` will be the XOR of the two unique numbers.
3. Find a set bit in `x`. This can be done by finding the rightmost set bit using the expression `x & -x`.
4. Initialize two variables `a` and `b` to 0.
5. Iterate through the array `nums` again and XOR each element with `a` if the corresponding bit in `x` is set, otherwise XOR it with `b`.
6. After this step, `a` will be one of the unique numbers and `b` will be the other unique number.
7. Return the pair `(a, b)`.

Here is the Python code for the algorithm:
Response: python
def find_unique_numbers(nums):
    x = 0

        x ^= num
    
    set_bit = x & -x

CoT: To determine if the given edges form a valid tree, we need to check two conditions:
1. The graph is connected.
2. The graph has no cycles.

We can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to check these conditions. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize a visited array**: Create an array `visited` of size `n` to keep track of the visited nodes during the DFS. Initialize all elements to `False`.
2. **Perform DFS**: Start the DFS from node `0`. During the DFS, mark each visited node as `True` and recursively visit all its adjacent nodes that have not been visited yet.
3. **Check for cycles**: If we encounter a node that is already visited during the DFS, it means there is a cycle in the graph. In this case, return `False`.
4. **Check connectivity**: After the DFS, if there are any nodes that are still `False` in the `visited` array, it means the graph is not connected. In this case, return `False`.
5. **otherwise**: If the DFS completes without finding any cycles and all nodes are visited, the graph is a valid tree. Return `True`.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def is_valid_tree(n, edges):

CoT: To find the `nth` ugly number, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will generate the sequence of ugly numbers up to the `n`th term. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize an array to store the ugly numbers.** Since we need to find the `n`th ugly number, we will create an array of size `n`.
2. ** Initialize the first ugly number.** The first ugly number is 1.
3. ** Initialize three-pointers to keep track of the multiples of 2, 3, and 5.** These pointers will help us generate the next ugly number by taking the minimum of the next multiples of 2, 3, and 5.

Original Question: There are a row of `n` houses, each house can be painted with one of the `k` colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x k` cost matrix costs.

*   For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with color `0`; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house `1` with color `2`, and so on...

CoT: To solve the problem of painting the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color and the total cost is minimized, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to paint the first `i` houses such that the `i`-th house is painted with color `j`.

The recurrence relation for `dp[i][j]` can be defined as:
\[ dp[i][j] = \min_{\substack{1 \leq m \leq k \\ m \neq j}} (dp[i-1][m]) + costs[i][j] \]
This means that the minimum cost to paint the `i`-th house with color `j` is the minimum cost to paint the `(i-1)`-th house with any color other than `j`, plus the cost of painting the `i`-th house with color `j`.

We can initialize the `dp` array for the first house as:
\[ dp[0][j] = costs[0][j] \]
for all `j` from 0 to `k-1`.

Then, we iterate through each house from 1 to `n-1` and update the `dp` array using the recurrence relation. Finally, the minimum cost to paint all houses is the minimum value in the last row of the `dp` array.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def min_cost_to_paint_houses(costs):

CoT: To determine if a permutation of a given string `s` can form a palindrome, we need to consider the properties of palindromes. A palindrome has the same sequence of characters when read forwards and backwards. This means that for a string to be a palindrome, the frequency of each character must be even, except for at most one character which can have an odd frequency (this character would be placed in the middle of the palindrome).

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. Count the frequency of each character in the string `s`.
2. Check the frequencies to see if more than one character has an odd frequency. If more than one character has an odd frequency, then it is not possible to form a palindrome from any permutation of the string.
3. If at most one character has an odd frequency, then it is possible to form a palindrome.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def can_form_palindrome(s):
    # Step 1: Count the frequency of each character
    freq = {}
    for char in s:
        if char in freq:

    # Step 3: Determine if it is possible to form a palindrome
    if odd_count > 1:
        return False
    else:
        return True

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 16`
*   `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given a string s, return _all the palindromic permutations (without duplicates) of it_. You may return the answer in **any order**. If `s` has no palindromic permutation, return an empty list. **Example 1:** **Input:** s = "aabb" **Output:** \["abba","baab"\] **Example 2:** **Input:** s = "abc" **Output:** \[\] **Constraints:** * `1 <= s.length <= 16` * `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
CoT: To find all palindromic permutations of a given string `s`, we need to consider the properties of palindromes. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. This means that for a string to be a palindrome, the frequency of each character must be even, except for at most one character which can have an odd frequency (this character will be placed in the middle of the palindrome).

Here is the step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Count the frequency of each character in the string `s`.**
2. **Check if the string can form a palindrome.** If any more than one character has an odd frequency, then it is not possible to form a palindrome. Return an empty list.
3. **Generate all possible palindromic permutations.** We can use a recursive function to generate all permutations of the first half of the string ( plus one if there is a character with an odd frequency), and then mirror these permutations to form the second half of the palindrome.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
from itertools import permutations

def generate_palindromic_permutations(s):
    # Count the frequency of each character
    freq = {}
    for char in s:
        freq[char] = freq.get(char, 0) + 1
    
    # Check if the string can form a palindrome
    odd_count = sum(1 for count in freq.values() if count % 2!= 0)
    if odd_count > 1:
        return []
    
    # Generate all permutations of the first half of the string
    first_half = []
    for char, count in freq.items():
        if count % 2 == 0:
            first_half.extend([char] * (count // 2))
        else:
            first_half.extend([char] * (count // 2))
            odd_char = char
    
    # Generate all unique permutations of the first half
    unique_permutations = set(permutations(first_half))
    
    # Form the palindromic permutations
    palindromic_permutations = []
    for perm in unique_permutations:
        if odd_char:
            palindromic_permutations.append(perm + (odd_char,) + perm[::-1])
        else:
            palindromic_permutations.append(perm + perm[::-1])
    
    return palindromic_permutations

Original Question: Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return _the only number in the range that is missing from the array._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,0,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range \[0,3\]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range \[0,2\]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1\]
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range \[0,9\]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 104`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
*   All the numbers of `nums` are **unique**.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the missing number in an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range \([0, n]\), we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the sum of all numbers from 0 to `n` using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\).
2. Calculate the sum of all numbers in the array `nums`.
3. The missing number is the difference between the sum of all numbers from 0 to `n` and the sum of all numbers in the array `nums`.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def find_missing_number(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    sum_full_range = n * (n + 1) // 2
    sum array = sum(nums)
    missing_number = sum_full_range - sum_array

CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the letters in the alien language based on the given sorted list of words. We can use a topological sort algorithm to find the order of the letters. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the letters and their dependencies:**
   - Create a set `letters` to store all unique letters in the words.
   - Create a dictionary ` depends` to store the dependencies between letters. The key is a letter, and the value is a list of letters that depend on it.

2. **弹珠 the dependencies:**
   - For each word in the list, iterate through its letters and add dependencies. If a letter appears before another letter in the word, it depends on the letter that comes before it.

3. **Perform topological sort:**
   - Use a queue to perform the topological sort. Start with letters that have no dependencies.
   - Remove a letter from the queue, add it to the result, and update the dependencies of the remaining letters.

4. **Check for cycles:**
   - If the queue is empty but not all letters have been added to the result, there is a cycle in the graph, and there is no valid order. Return an empty string.

5. **Return the result:**
   - If all letters have been added to the result, return the result.

Here's the Python code to implement this algorithm:

Original Question: Design an algorithm to encode **a list of strings** to **a string**. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Machine 1 (sender) has the function:

string encode(vector strs) {
  // ... your code
  return encoded\_string;
}

Machine 2 (receiver) has the function:

vector decode(string s) {
  //... your code

So Machine 1 does:

string encoded\_string = encode(strs);

and Machine 2 does:

vector strs2 = decode(encoded\_string);

`strs2` in Machine 2 should be the same as `strs` in Machine 1.

Implement the `encode` and `decode` methods.

You are not allowed to solve the problem using any serialize methods (such as `eval`).

**Example 1:**

CoT: To solve the problem of encoding and decoding a list of strings to a single string and back, we can use a simple approach where we concatenate the strings with a unique separator that is not a part of the original strings. This ensures that the original strings can be disamblguated during the解oding process.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. ** encode **:
   - Initialize an empty string `encoded_string`.
   - Iterate through each string `str` in the list `strs`.
   - Add `str` to `encoded_string` followed by a unique separator (e.g., `#`).
   - After adding the last string, remove the separator from the end of `encoded_string`.

2. ** decode **:
   - Initialize an empty vector `strs2`.
   - Iterate through the characters of `encoded_string`.
   - read the strings until the unique separator `#` is encountered.
   - Add the read string to `strs2`.
   - Repeat the process until the end of `encoded_string` is reached.

Here is the Python code implementing the above algorithm:
Response: python
def encode(strs):
    encoded_string = ""
    separator = '#'
    for str in strs:
        encoded_string += str + separator
    encoded_string = encoded_string[:-1]  # Remove the last separator
    return encoded_string

def decode(s):
    strs2 = []

        if str:
            strs2.append(str)
        s = s[s.find(separator) + 1:]
    return strs2

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the \( k \) values in a binary search tree (BST) that are closest to a given target value, we can use a combination of binary search and in-order traversal. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Convert the BST to an In-Order List:**
   Perform an in-order traversal of the binary search tree to convert it into a sorted list. This is because the in-order traversal of a binary search tree yields a sorted sequence of its elements.

2. **Find theIndex of the Target Value:**
   Use binary search to find the index of the target value in the sorted list. If the target value is not found, find the index where it would be if it were inserted into the list.

3. **Determine the Range of indices:**
   Once we have the index of the target value, we need to determine the range of indices in the sorted list that are closest to the target value. This range will be centered around the index of the target value.

4. **Extract the \( k \) Closest Values:**
   Extract the \( k \) values from the sorted list within the determined range.

Let's implement this approach in Python:
Response: python
from bisect import bisect

        in_order_traversal(node right)
    in_order_traversal(root)

    # Step 2: Find the index of the target value
    index = bisect(in_order_list, target)

    # Step 3: Determine the range of indices
    left_index = max(0, index - k // 2)
    right_index = min(len(in_order_list) - 1, index + k // 2)

CoT: To convert a non-negative integer `num` to its English words representation, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and use a systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step solution in Python:

1. **Define the basic number words:**
   - Units: ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine"]
   - Tens: ["Ten", "Twenty", "Thirty", "Forty", "Fifty", "Sixty", "Seventy", "Eighty", "Ninety"]

2. ** handle the cases for numbers less than 1000:**
   - For numbers less than 100, use the units and tens words directly.
   - For numbers between 100 and 999, use the hundreds word, followed by "Hundred", and then the units and tens words.

3. ** handle the cases for numbers greater than or equal to 1000:**
   - For numbers between 1000 and 999999, use the thousands word, followed by "Thousand", and then the hundreds, tens, and units words.
   - For numbers greater than or equal to 1000000, use the millions word, followed by "Million", and then the thousands, hundreds, tens, and units words.

4. **Implement the conversion function:**
   - Use integer division and modulo operations to determine the appropriate words for each place value.

Here's the Python code to implement this:

Original Question: Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return _the researcher's h-index_.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** citations = \[3,0,6,1,5\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** \[3,0,6,1,5\] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** citations = \[1,3,1\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `n == citations.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 5000`
*   `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the quantity of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return _the researcher's h-index_.

CoT: To find the h-index of a researcher given an array of citations, we can follow these steps:

1. Sort the array of citations in non-increasing order. This will allow us to easily check the condition for the h-index.
2. Iterate through the sorted array and find the maximum value of `h` such that the first `h` elements are all greater than or equal to `h`.

Here is the Python code to implement this:
Response: python
def h_index(citations):
    # Step 1: Sort the array in non-increasing order
    citations.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through the sorted array to find the h-index
    h = 0
    for i in range(len(citations)):
        if citations[i] >= i + 1:
            h = i + 1
        else:
            break

CoT: To find the h-index of a researcher given an array of citations sorted in ascending order, we can use a binary search approach. The h-index is the maximum value of \( h \) such that the researcher has published at least \( h \) papers that have each been cited at least \( h \) times.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Binary Search Approach:**
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array respectively.
   - While `left` is less than or equal to `right`, do the following:
     - Calculate the middle index `mid` as \( \left( \frac{left + right}{2} \right) \).
     - Check if the citations at index `mid` are at least `mid` (i.e., \( citations[mid] \geq mid \)).
       - If true, then the h-index could be at least `mid`. Set `right` to \( mid - 1 \).
       - If false, then the h-index cannot be `mid` or greater. Set `left` to \( mid + 1 \).
   - After the loop, the h-index will be the value of `left` minus 1 (since `left` is the smallest index where \( citations[left-1] < left-1 \)).

2. **Python Code:**
   - implement the binary search approach in Python.

Here is the Python code:
Response: python
def find_h_index(citations):
    left = 0
    right = len(citations) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if citations[mid] >= mid:
            right = mid - 1

Original Question: You are painting a fence of `n` posts with `k` different colors. You must paint the posts following these rules:

*   Every post must be painted **exactly one** color.
*   There **cannot** be three or more **consecutive** posts with the same color.

CoT: To solve the problem of painting a fence with \( n \) posts using \( k \) different colors such that no three consecutive posts have the same color, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define \( dp[i][j] \) as the number of ways to paint the first \( i \) posts such that the \( i \)-th post is painted with color \( j \).

The base cases are:
- For \( i = 1 \), any of the \( k \) colors can be used, so \( dp[1][j] = 1 \) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( k \).
- For \( i = 2 \), any of the \( k \) colors can be used for the second post, so \( dp[2][j] = k \) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( k \).

For \( i \geq 3 \), the \( i \)-th post can be painted with color \( j \) if the \((i-1)\)-th post is painted with a different color or the \((i-2)\)-th post is painted with a different color than the \((i-1)\)-th post. Therefore, we have:
\[ dp[i][j] = \sum_{l \neq j} dp[i-1][l] + \sum_{l \neq j} dp[i-2][l] \]
This can be simplified to:
\[ dp[i][j] = (k-1) \cdot (dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-2][j]) \]

However, a more efficient way to compute this is to use the following recurrence relation:
\[ dp[i] = (k-1) \cdot (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) \]
where \( dp[i] \) is the total number of ways to paint the first \( i \) posts.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def count_ways(n, k):
    if n == 1:
        return k
    if n == 2:
        return k * k
    
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = k
    dp[2] = k * k
    
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (k - 1) * (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2])
    
    return dp[n]

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
Original Question: Suppose you are at a party with `n` people labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other `n - 1` people know the celebrity, but the celebrity does not know any of them.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. You are only allowed to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B? " to get information about whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given a helper function `bool knows(a, b)` that tells you whether `a` knows `b`. Implement a function `int findCelebrity(n)`. There will be exactly one celebrity if they are at the party.

Return _the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity at the party_. If there is no celebrity, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[1,1,0\],\[0,1,0\],\[1,1,1\]\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph\[i\]\[j\] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph\[i\]\[j\] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[1,0,1\],\[1,1,0\],\[0,1,1\]\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There is no celebrity.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == graph.length == graph[i].length`
*   `2 <= n <= 100`
*   `graph[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
*   `graph[i][i] == 1`

**Follow up:** If the maximum number of allowed calls to the API `knows` is `3 * n`, could you find a solution without exceeding the maximum number of calls?

CoT: To find the celebrity in a party with \( n \) people, we can use a divide-and-conquer approach. The key idea is to use the `knows` function to compare pairs of people and eliminate those who are not the celebrity.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. **Divide the people into two groups**: If \( n \) is even, divide the people into two groups of \( \frac{n}{2} \). If \( n \) is odd, divide the people into one group of \( \frac{n-1}{2} \) and one group of \( \frac{n+1}{2} \).

2. **Recursively find the celebrity in each group**: Use the `knows` function to determine which group contains the celebrity. If a person in the first group knows everyone in the second group, then the celebrity must be in the first group. Otherwise, the celebrity must be in the second group.

3. **Base case**: If \( n = 1 \), then the only person is the celebrity.

4. **Combine the results**: Once we have found the celebrity in each group, we need to check if the celebrity from the first group knows everyone in the second group and if the celebrity from the second group knows everyone in the first group. If both conditions are satisfied, then the celebrity is the one who knows everyone in the other group. Otherwise, there is no celebrity.

Here is the Python code implementing this algorithm:
Response: python
def findCelebrity(n):
    def find in group(start, end):
        if start == end:
            return start

CoT: To determine the first bad version among `n` versions, we can use a binary search approach. This approach minimizes the number of API calls by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize the search space:**
   - Set the left boundary `l` to 1.
   - Set the right boundary `r` to `n`.

2. **Perform binary search:**
   - While `l` is less than or equal to `r`, do the following:
     - Calculate the middle index `m` as the average of `l` and `r`.
     - If `isBad Version(m)` returns `true`, then the first bad version is in the right half of the search space. Set `l` to `m + 1`.
     - If `isBad Version(m)` returns `false`, then the first bad version is in the left half of the search space. Set `r` to `m - 1`.

3. **Return the result:**
   - When the loop ends, `l` will be the first bad version.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:
Response: python
def first_bad_version(n):
    l = 1
    r = n

    while l <= r:
        m = l + (r - l) // 2

Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given an integer `n`, return _the least quantity of perfect square numbers that sum to_ `n`. A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, `1`, `4`, `9`, and `16` are perfect squares while `3` and `11` are not. **Example 1:** **Input:** n = 12 **Output:** 3 **Explanation:** 12 = 4 + 4 + 4. **Example 2:** **Input:** n = 13 **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** 13 = 4 + 9. **Constraints:** * `1 <= n <= 104`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the least quantity of perfect square numbers that sum to a given integer `n`, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize the DP Array**: Create an array `dp` of size `n+1` where `dp[i]` will store the minimum number of perfect squares that sum to `i`. Initialize `dp[0]` to 0 because 0 can be represented as the sum of 0 perfect squares.

2. ** Fill the DP Array**: For each integer `i` from 1 to `n`, iterate through all perfect squares `j*j` (where `j*j <= i`) and update `dp[i]` as `min(dp[i], dp[i - j*j] + 1)`. This means that the minimum number of perfect squares that sum to `i` is the minimum of the current value of `dp[i]` and the minimum number of perfect squares that sum to `i - j*j` plus one.

3. **Return the Result**: After filling the DP array, `dp[n]` will contain the minimum number of perfect squares that sum to `n`.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
import math

def min_perfect_squares(n):
    # Initialize the DP array
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Fill the DP array
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = float('inf')  # Start with infinity
        for j in range(1, int(math.sqrt(i)) + 1):
            square = j * j
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - square] + 1)
    
    return dp[n]

# Example usage
print(min_perfect_squares(12))  # Output: 3
print(min_perfect_squares(13))  # Output: 2

You may assume the input array always has a valid answer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,5,2,1,6,4\]
**Output:** \[3,5,1,6,2,4\]
**Explanation:** \[1,6,2,5,3,4\] is also accepted.

**Example 2:**

**Constraints:**

CoT: To solve the problem of reordering the array such that `nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3]...`, we can use a simple approach that involves iterating through the array and swapping elements to satisfy the given condition. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. ** Initialize two-pointers:**
   - Set a pointer `i` to the first element of the array.
   - Set a pointer `j` to the second element of the array.

2. ** Iterate through the array:**
   - While `i` is less than the length of the array minus 1, do the following:
     - If `nums[i] <= nums[i+1]`, move `i` to the next element.
     - If `nums[i] > nums[i+1]`, swap `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]`.

3. ** Set the second pointer to the third element:**
   - Set `j` to the third element of the array.

4. ** Iterate through the array again:**
   - While `j` is less than the length of the array minus 1, do the following:
     - If `nums[j] >= nums[j+1]`, move `j` to the next element.
     - If `nums[j] < nums[j+1]`, swap `nums[j]` and `nums[j+1]`.

By following these steps, we ensure that the array is rearranged such that `nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3]...`.

Here's the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def odd even reordering(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Iterate through the array and swap elements to satisfy the condition for odd-indexed positions
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        if nums[i] < nums[i-1]:
            nums[i], nums[i-1] = nums[i-1], nums[i]
    
    # Set the second pointer to the third element
    j = 2
    
    # Iterate through the array again and swap elements to satisfy the condition for even-indexed positions
    while j < n:
        if nums[j] > nums[j+1]:
            nums[j], nums[j+1] = nums[j+1], nums[j]
        j += 2
    
    return nums

Original Question: Given two vectors of integers `v1` and `v2`, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

Implement the `ZigzagIterator` class:

*   `ZigzagIterator(List v1, List v2)` initializes the object with the two vectors `v1` and `v2`.
*   `boolean hasNext()` returns `true` if the iterator still has elements, and `false` otherwise.
*   `int next()` returns the current element of the iterator and moves the iterator to the next element.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1,2\], v2 = \[3,4,5,6\]
**Output:** \[1,3,2,4,5,6\]
**Explanation:** By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: \[1,3,2,4,5,6\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1\], v2 = \[\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** v1 = \[\], v2 = \[1\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= v1.length, v2.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= v1.length + v2.length <= 2000`
*   `-231 <= v1[i], v2[i] <= 231 - 1`

**Follow-up Example:**

CoT: To implement the `Zigzagzag` iterator for two vectors, we can use a simple approach with two pointers to keep track of the current positions in each vector. We will alternate between incrementing the pointer for the first vector and the second vector, and use a flag to determine which vector to increment next.

Original Question: Given a string `num` that contains only digits and an integer `target`, return _**all possibilities** to insert the binary operators_ `'+'`_,_ `'-'`_, and/or_ `'*'` _between the digits of_ `num` _so that the resultant expression evaluates to the_ `target` _value_.

Note that operands in the returned expressions **should not** contain leading zeros.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num =  "123 ", target = 6
**Output:** \[ "1\*2\*3 ", "1+2+3 "\]
**Explanation:** Both  "1\*2\*3 " and  "1+2+3 " evaluate to 6.

**Explanation:** There are no expressions that can be created from  "3456237490 " to evaluate to 9191.

**Constraints:**

*   `num` consists of only digits.
*   `-231 <= target <= 231 - 1`

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to generate all possible expressions by inserting the binary operators `+`, `-`, and `*` between the digits of the string `num`. We will then evaluate each expression to check if it equals the target value.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define a recursive function** `find_expressions` that takes the current index `i` in the string `num`, the current expression `expr`, and the current value `val` of the expression.
2. **Base case**: If the current index `i` is equal to the length of the string `num`, check if the current value `val` equals the target. If it does, add the current expression `expr` to the result list.
3. **Recursive case**: For each index `i`, consider three possible operations: `+`, `-`, and `*`. For each operation, update the expression and the value, and make a recursive call with the next index `i+1`.
4. **Convert the string to a number**: When updating the value, convert the substring from `num[i]` to the end of the current expression to a number.
5. ** Avoid leading zeros**: When inserting an operator, ensure that the new expression does not start with a zero if the previous character is not a decimal point.

Here is the Python code implementing the above approach:
Response: python
def find_expressions(num, target):
    result = []
    def find_expressions_recursive(i, expr, val):
        if i == len(num):
            if val == target:
                result.append(expr)
            return
        # try inserting a plus operator
        find_expressions_recursive(i+1, expr + '+' + num[i], val + int(num[i]))
        # try inserting a minus operator
        find_expressions_recursive(i+1, expr + '-' + num[i], val - int(num[i]))
        # try inserting a multiplication operator
        find_expressions_recursive(i+1, expr + '*' + num[i], val * int(num[i]))

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, where `left` starts at the beginning of the array and `right` starts at the end of the array.
2. Iterate through the array with the `left` pointer until it finds a `0`.
3. Iterate through the array with the `right` pointer until it finds a non-zero element.
4. If `left` is at a `0` and `right` is at a non-zero element, swap the elements at positions `left` and `right`.

Original Question: Design an iterator that supports the `peek` operation on an existing iterator in addition to the `hasNext` and the `next` operations.

Implement the `PeekingIterator` class:

*   `PeekingIterator(Iterator nums)` Initializes the object with the given integer iterator `iterator`.
*   `int next()` Returns the next element in the array and moves the pointer to the next element.
*   `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there are still elements in the array.
*   `int peek()` Returns the next element in the array **without** moving the pointer.

**Note:** Each language may have a different implementation of the constructor and `Iterator`, but they all support the `int next()` and `boolean hasNext()` functions.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "PeekingIterator ",  "next ",  "peek ",  "next ",  "next ",  "hasNext "\]
\[\[\[1, 2, 3\]\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, 1, 2, 2, 3, false\]

**Explanation**
PeekingIterator peekingIterator = new PeekingIterator(\[1, 2, 3\]); // \[**1**,2,3\]
peekingIterator.next();    // return 1, the pointer moves to the next element \[1,**2**,3\].
peekingIterator.peek();    // return 2, the pointer does not move \[1,**2**,3\].
peekingIterator.next();    // return 2, the pointer moves to the next element \[1,2,**3**\]
peekingIterator.next();    // return 3, the pointer moves to the next element \[1,2,3\]
peekingIterator.hasNext(); // return False

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
*   All the calls to `next` and `peek` are valid.

CoT: To design an iterator that supports the `.peek` operation on an existing iterator in addition to the `hasNext` and the `next` operations, we can use a simple approach where we store the next element in a data structure along with the current position in the original iterator. Here's the step-by-step implementation in Python:

1. **Initialize the `PeedingIterator` object with the given integer iterator ` iterator`.**
   - Create a new data structure (e.g., a tuple or a class) to store the next element in the array and the current position in the original iterator.
   - Initialize this data structure with the next element from the original iterator and the current position (which is initially 0).

2. **Implement the `next` method.**
   - If the next element is `None` (i.e., we have reached the end of the array), raise an exception.
   - Otherwise, return the next element and update the data structure to store the next element in the array and the next position.

3. **Implement the ` hasNext` method.**
   - Check if the next element is `None`. If it is, return `False`. Otherwise, return `True`.

4. **Implement the `peek` method.**
   - Return the next element without moving the pointer. This can be done by simply returning the next element from the data structure without updating it.

The successor of a node `p` is the node with the smallest key greater than `p.val`. **Example 1:** **Input:** root = \[2,1,3\], p = 1 **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type. **Example 2:** **Input:** root = \[5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1\], p = 6 **Output:** null **Explanation:** There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is `null`. **Constraints:** * The quantity of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`. * `-105 <= Node.val <= 105` * All Nodes will have unique values.
CoT: To find the in-order successor of a given node `p` in a binary search tree (BST), we can follow these steps:

1. **If the node `p` has a right child:**
   - The in-order successor is the leftmost node in the right child's right子 tree. This is because the right child is greater than `p`, and the leftmost node in its right child's right子 tree will be the smallest node greater than `p`.

2. **If the node `p` does not have a right child:**
   - The in-order successor is the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of `p` and its rightmost ancestor. This is because the rightmost ancestor of `p` will be the smallest node greater than `p` in the tree.

Let's implement this in Python using the given binary search tree structure.

Original Question: You are given an `m x n` grid `rooms` initialized with these three possible values.

*   `-1` A wall or an obstacle.
*   `0` A gate.
*   `INF` Infinity means an empty room. We use the value `231 - 1 = 2147483647` to represent `INF` as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than `2147483647`.

Fill each empty room with the distance to _its nearest gate_. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with `INF`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** rooms = \[\[2147483647,-1,0,2147483647\],\[2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1\],\[2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1\],\[0,-1,2147483647,2147483647\]\]

CoT: To solve the problem of filling each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize the grid and the queue:**
   - Create a queue to store the coordinates of the gates.
   - Initialize a visited matrix to keep track of the rooms that have been processed.

2. **Find all the gates and add them to the queue:**
   - Iterate through the grid and add the coordinates of all gates to the queue.
   - Mark these rooms as visited.

3. **Perform BFS:**
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Dequeue a room from the queue.
     - For each of the four adjacent rooms (up, down, left, right), check if it is within the grid and not visited.
     - If the adjacent room is empty, update its distance to the current room's distance plus 1, and add it to the queue.
     - Mark the adjacent room as visited.

4. **Return the updated grid:**
   - After the BFS is complete, the grid will contain the distances to the nearest gate for each empty room. Return the updated grid.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
from collections import deque

def shortest_distance_to_gate(rooms):
    m, n = len(rooms), len(rooms[0])
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(m)]

    # Find all gates and add them to the queue
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if rooms[i][j] == 0:
                queue.append((i, j))
                visited[i][j] = True

    # Perform BFS
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny] and rooms[nx][ny] == 231 - 1:
                rooms[nx][ny] = rooms[x][y] + 1
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                queue.append((nx, ny))

    return rooms

# Example usage

Original Question: Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return _this repeated number_.

You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and uses only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,3,4,2,2\]
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,1,3,4,2\]
**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `nums.length == n + 1`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
*   All the integers in `nums` appear only **once** except for **precisely one integer** which appears **two or more** times.

**Follow up:**

*   How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
*   Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the repeated number in an array `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive, we can use the following approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have an array `nums` of length `n + 1`.
   - Each element in `nums` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive.
   - There is exactly one repeated number in `nums`.

2. **Prove the Existence of a Duplicate:**
   - Since there are `n + 1` elements in `nums` and only `n` distinct possible values (from 1 to `n`), by the pigeonhole principle, at least one value must appear more than once.

3. **Find the Repeated Number:**
   - We can use the property of the array to find the repeated number without modifying the array and using only constant extra space.
   - One effective method is to use the **XOR** operation.

4. **Using XOR:**
   - The XOR operation has the property that `a XOR a = 0` and `a XOR 0 = a`.
   - We can XOR all the elements in `nums` and then XOR the result with all the integers from 1 to `n`.
   - The result will be the repeated number because all other numbers will cancel out.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def find_repeated_number(nums):
    n = len(nums) - 1
    total_xor = 0
    array_xor = 0

    # XOR all elements in nums
    for num in nums:
        total_xor ^= num

    # XOR all integers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        array_xor ^= i

    # The result is the repeated number
    return total_xor ^ array_xor

# Example usage
nums1 = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]
print(find_repeated_number(nums1))  # Output: 2

nums2 = [3, 1, 3, 4, 2]
print(find_repeated_number(nums2))  # Output: 3

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
Original Question: The **abbreviation** of a word is a concatenation of its first letter, the number of characters between the first and last letter, and its last letter. If a word has only two characters, then it is an **abbreviation** of itself.

For example:

*   `dog --> d1g` because there is one letter between the first letter `'d'` and the last letter `'g'`.
*   `internationalization --> i18n` because there are 18 letters between the first letter `'i'` and the last letter `'n'`.
*   `it --> it` because any word with only two characters is an **abbreviation** of itself.

Implement the `ValidWordAbbr` class:

*   `ValidWordAbbr(String[] dictionary)` Initializes the object with a `dictionary` of words.
*   `boolean isUnique(string word)` Returns `true` if **either** of the following conditions are met (otherwise returns `false`):
    *   There is no word in `dictionary` whose **abbreviation** is equal to `word`'s **abbreviation**.
    *   For any word in `dictionary` whose **abbreviation** is equal to `word`'s **abbreviation**, that word and `word` are **the same**.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "ValidWordAbbr ",  "isUnique ",  "isUnique ",  "isUnique ",  "isUnique ",  "isUnique "\]
\[\[\[ "deer ",  "door ",  "cake ",  "card "\]\], \[ "dear "\], \[ "cart "\], \[ "cane "\], \[ "make "\], \[ "cake "\]\]
**Output**
\[null, false, true, false, true, true\]

**Explanation**
ValidWordAbbr validWordAbbr = new ValidWordAbbr(\[ "deer ",  "door ",  "cake ",  "card "\]);
validWordAbbr.isUnique( "dear "); // return false, dictionary word  "deer " and word  "dear " have the same abbreviation  "d2r " but are not the same.
validWordAbbr.isUnique( "cart "); // return true, no words in the dictionary have the abbreviation  "c2t ".
validWordAbbr.isUnique( "cane "); // return false, dictionary word  "cake " and word  "cane " have the same abbreviation   "c2e " but are not the same.
validWordAbbr.isUnique( "make "); // return true, no words in the dictionary have the abbreviation  "m2e ".
validWordAbbr.isUnique( "cake "); // return true, because  "cake " is already in the dictionary and no other word in the dictionary has  "c2e " abbreviation.

*   `1 <= dictionary.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 20`
*   `dictionary[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

Original Question: According to [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life): "The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. "

The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: **live** (represented by a `1`) or **dead** (represented by a `0`). Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, return _the next state_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[0,1,0\],\[0,0,1\],\[1,1,1\],\[0,0,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[0,0,0\],\[1,0,1\],\[0,1,1\],\[0,1,0\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\[1,1\],\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[1,1\],\[1,1\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 25`
*   `board[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

**Follow up:**

*   Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
*   In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

Original Question: Given a `pattern` and a string `s`, find if `s` follows the same pattern.

Here **follow** means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in `pattern` and a **non-empty** word in `s`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** pattern =  "abba ", s =  "dog cat cat dog "
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** pattern =  "abba ", s =  "dog cat cat fish "
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** pattern =  "aaaa ", s =  "dog cat cat dog "
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= pattern.length <= 300`
*   `pattern` contains only lower-case English letters.
*   `1 <= s.length <= 3000`
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters and spaces `' '`.

CoT: To determine if a string `s` follows the same pattern as a given pattern `pattern`, we need to check if there is a bijection between a letter in `pattern` and a non-empty word in `s`. This means that each letter in `pattern` must correspond to a unique word in `s` and vice versa.

Here is the step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Count the frequency of each letter in `pattern`**.
2. **Count the frequency of each word in `s`**.
3. **Check if the frequency of each letter in `pattern` matches the frequency of a unique word in `s`**.
4. **Ensure that the total number of letters in `pattern` is equal to the total number of words in `s`**.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
from collections import Counter

def word pattern_match(pattern, s):
    # Step 1: Count the frequency of each letter in pattern
    pattern_count = Counter(pattern)
    
    # Step 2: Count the frequency of each word in s
    word_count = Counter(s.split())
    
    # Step 3: Check if the frequency of each letter in pattern matches the frequency of a unique word in s
    # and ensure that the total number of letters in pattern is equal to the total number of words in s
    if len(pattern_count)!= len(word_count):
        return False
    for letter, count in pattern_count.items():
        if word_count[letter]!= count:
            return False
    
    return True

# Example usage
pattern = "abba"
s = "dog cat cat dog"
print(word_pattern_match(pattern, s))  # Output: True

pattern = "abba"
s = "dog cat cat fish"
print(word_pattern_match(pattern, s))  # Output: False

pattern = "aaaa"
s = "dog cat cat dog"

Original Question: Given a `pattern` and a string `s`, return `true` _if_ `s` _**matches** the_ `pattern`_._

A string `s` **matches** a `pattern` if there is some **bijective mapping** of single characters to strings such that if each character in `pattern` is replaced by the string it maps to, then the resulting string is `s`. A **bijective mapping** means that no two characters map to the same string, and no character maps to two different strings.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** pattern =  "abab ", s =  "redblueredblue "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One possible mapping is as follows:
'a' ->  "red "
'b' ->  "blue "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** pattern =  "aaaa ", s =  "asdasdasdasd "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One possible mapping is as follows:
'a' ->  "asd "

**Example 3:**

**Input:** pattern =  "aabb ", s =  "xyzabcxzyabc "
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= pattern.length, s.length <= 20`
*   `pattern` and `s` consist of only lowercase English letters.

CoT: To determine if a string `s` matches a pattern, we need to check if there exists a bijective mapping of single characters to strings such that replacing each character in the pattern with its corresponding string in the mapping results in the string `s`. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. **Check the lengths of the pattern and the string:**
   If the lengths of the pattern and the string are not equal, it is impossible for the string to match the pattern. This is because a bijective mapping requires that each character in the pattern corresponds to exactly one string in the mapping, and vice versa.

2. **Create a mapping of characters to strings:**
   Iterate through the pattern and the string simultaneously, and map each character in the pattern to the corresponding string in the mapping.

3. **Check if the mapping is bijective:**
   To check if the mapping is bijective, we need to ensure that no two characters map to the same string, and no character maps to two different strings. We can use a set to keep track of the strings that have already been mapped to.

4. **Verify the mapping:**
   After creating the mapping, verify that each character in the pattern is mapped to a unique string and that each string in the mapping corresponds to exactly one character in the pattern.

Here's the Python code to implement this approach:
Response: python
def does_match(pattern, s):
    if len(pattern)!= len(s):
        return False

    mapping = {}
    for i in range(len(pattern)):

            mapping[s[i]] = s[i]

Original Question: You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend:

*   Initially, there is a heap of stones on the table.
*   You and your friend will alternate taking turns, and **you go first**.
*   On each turn, the person whose turn it is will remove 1 to 3 stones from the heap.
*   The one who removes the last stone is the winner.

Given `n`, the number of stones in the heap, return `true` _if you can win the game assuming both you and your friend play optimally, otherwise return_ `false`.

CoT: To determine if you can win the Nim Game given the initial number of stones `n`, we need to analyze the game's strategy. The key insight is that the player who faces a heap with a number of stones that is a multiple of 4 will always lose if both players play optimally. This is because the player can only remove 1, 2, or 3 stones, and no matter which number they choose, the opponent can always make the remaining number of stones a multiple of 4 again.

Let's break down the reasoning:

1. If `n` is a multiple of 4, the first player (you) will always lose. This is because whatever number of stones you remove (1, 2, or 3), the second player (your friend) can always remove a number of stones to make the remaining number of stones a multiple of 4 again. This process will continue until there are 4 stones left, and the second player will remove all 4 stones, winning the game.
2. If `n` is not a multiple of 4, the first player (you) can always make the remaining number of stones a multiple of 4 by removing the appropriate number of stones (1, 2, or 3). This will leave the second player (your friend) with a multiple of 4 stones, and as we saw in the previous case, the second player will lose if both players play optimally.

Therefore, the solution to the problem is to check if `n` is a multiple of 4. If it is, return `False` (you lose), otherwise return `True` (you win).

Original Question: You are playing a Flip Game with your friend.

You are given a string `currentState` that contains only `'+'` and `'-'`. You and your friend take turns to flip **two consecutive** `"++ "` into `"-- "`. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move, and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Return all possible states of the string `currentState` after **one valid move**. You may return the answer in **any order**. If there is no valid move, return an empty list `[]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** currentState =  "++++ "

**Input:** currentState =  "+ "
**Output:** \[\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= currentState.length <= 500`
*   `currentState[i]` is either `'+'` or `'-'`.

CoT: To solve the problem, we need to consider all possible moves that can be made on the given string `currentState`. A valid move consists of flipping two consecutive `++` into `--`. We will iterate through the string and check for all possible positions where a valid move can be made. For each valid move, we will create a new string with the two consecutive `++` replaced by `--` and add it to our list of possible states.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize an empty list `possible_states` to store all possible states after one valid move.
2. Iterate through the string `currentState` from the first character to the second-to-last character (since we need to check pairs of consecutive characters).
3. For each pair of consecutive characters, check if they are both `+`. If they are, make a valid move by replacing `++` with `--` and add the resulting string to `possible_states`.
4. After iterating through the entire string, return the list `possible_states`.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
def possible_states(current_state):
    possible_states = []
    for i in range(len(current_state) - 1):

CoT: To determine if the starting player can guarantee a win in the Flip Game, we need to analyze the game's state and the possible moves. The key is to use the concept of a "winning position" and a "losing position". A winning position is one where the player whose turn it is can force a win, and a losing position is one where any move the player makes will leave the opponent in a winning position.

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let's define a function `can_win(current_state)` that returns `True` if the starting player can guarantee a win from the current state, and `False` otherwise.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. **Base Case**: If the length of `current_state` is 1, the starting player cannot make a move, so return `False`.
2. **Check for Possible Moves**: Iterate through the string to find all possible moves (i.e., all occurrences of "++"). For each move, flip the two consecutive "++" to "--" and recursively call `can_win` on the resulting state.
3. **Determine the Result**: If any of the recursive calls returns `True`, then the starting player can guarantee a win from the current state, so return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

Here is the Python code implementing this algorithm:
Response: python
def can_win(current_state):
    # Base case: if the length of the string is 1, the starting player cannot make a move
    if len(current_state) == 1:
        return False
    
    # Check for possible moves
    for i in range(len(current_state) - 1):
        if current_state[i:i+2] == "++":
            # Flip the two consecutive "++" to "--"
            new_state = current_state[:i] + "--" + current_state[i+2:]
            # Recursively check if the opponent can win from the new state
            if not can_win(new_state):
                return True
    
    # If no move leads to a winning position for the opponent, the starting player cannot guarantee a win
    return False

# Example usage
print(can_win("++++ "))
print(can_win("++- "))

# Constraints and runtime complexity
# The runtime complexity of this algorithm is O(2^n), where n is the length of the input string.
# This is because each recursive call can potentially split the string into two parts, leading to a exponential number of recursive calls.

Original Question: The **median** is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

*   For example, for `arr = [2,3,4]`, the median is `3`.
*   For example, for `arr = [2,3]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

Implement the MedianFinder class:

*   `MedianFinder()` initializes the `MedianFinder` object.
*   `void addNum(int num)` adds the integer `num` from the data stream to the data structure.
*   `double findMedian()` returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "MedianFinder ",  "addNum ",  "addNum ",  "findMedian ",  "addNum ",  "findMedian "\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[3\], \[\]\]

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the median of a data stream, we can use a combination of two binary Heaps: a Max heap to store the smaller half of the numbers and a Min heap to store the larger half of the numbers. This approach ensures that the median can be found in constant time after each addition.

Here is the step-by-step implementation in Python:

1. **Initialize the Heaps:**
   - Create a Max heap to store the smaller half of the numbers.
   - Create a Min heap to store the larger half of the numbers.

2. **Add a Number:**
   - If the number is less than or equal to the root of the Max heap, add it to the Max heap.
   - If the number is greater than the root of the Max heap, add it to the Min heap.
   - After adding the number, ensure that the sizes of the two Heaps differ by at most 1. If they differ by more than 1, remove the root from the heap that has more elements.

3. **Find the Median:**
   - If the sizes of the two Heaps are equal, the median is the average of the roots of the two Heaps.
   - If the Max heap has more elements than the Min heap, the median is the root of the Max heap.
   - If the Min heap has more elements than the Max heap, the median is the root of the Min heap.

Here is the Python code for the MedianFinder class:

Original Question: Given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where each `1` marks the home of one friend, return _the minimal **total travel distance**_.

The **total travel distance** is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.

The distance is calculated using [Manhattan Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), where `distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,0,0,0,1\],\[0,0,0,0,0\],\[0,0,1,0,0\]\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Given three friends living at (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2).
The point (0,2) is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 is minimal.
So return 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,1\]\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
*   There will be **at least two** friends in the `grid`.
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where each `1` marks the home of one friend, return _the minimal **total travel distance**_. The **total travel distance** is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point. The distance is calculated using [Manhattan Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), where `distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|`. **Example 1:** **Input:** grid = \[\[1,0,0,0,1\],\[0,0,0,0,0\],\[0,0,1,0,0\]\] **Output:** 6 **Explanation:** Given three friends living at (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2).

CoT: To find the minimal total travel distance for the friends to meet, we need to consider the properties of the Manhattan distance. The Manhattan distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \(|x_2 - x_1| + |y_2 - y_1|\). The optimal meeting point to minimize the total travel distance is the median of the x-coordinates and the median of the y-coordinates of the friends' houses.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Find the coordinates of all friends:**
   - Iterate through the grid and collect the coordinates of all points where the value is 1.

2. **Calculate the median of the x-coordinates and the median of the y-coordinates:**
   - Sort the x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
   - If the number of friends is odd, the median is the middle element.
   - If the number of friends is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

3. **Calculate the total travel distance:**
   - Sum the Manhattan distances from each friend's house to the median point.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
import numpy as np

def min_total_distance(grid):
    # Find the coordinates of all friends
    friends = []
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[i])):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                friends.append((i, j))

    # Calculate the median of the x-coordinates and the median of the y-coordinates
    x coordinates = np.array([ coordinate[0] for coordinate in friends ])
    y coordinates = np.array([ coordinate[1] for coordinate in friends ])
    median_x = np.median(x coordinates)
    median_y = np.median(y coordinates)

    # Calculate the total travel distance
    total_distance = sum(abs(x - median_x) + abs(y - median_y) for x, y in friends)
    return total_distance

# Example 1
grid1 = [[1,0,0,0,1], [0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,1,0,0]]
print(min_total_distance(grid1))  # Output: 6

# Example 2

Original Question: Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://support.leetcode.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011883654-What-does-1-null-2-3-mean-in-binary-tree-representation-). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3,null,null,4,5\]
**Output:** \[1,2,3,null,null,4,5\]

CoT: To solve the problem of serialize and deserialize a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will use a string to represent the tree and then use another string to represent the deserialization.

Here is the algorithm:

1. ** Serialization:**
   - Perform a DFS on the binary tree.
   - During the DFS, if a node is null, we append " null " to the Serialization string.
   - If a node is not null, we append the value of the node to the Serialization string.
   - After the DFS, the Serialization string will contain the representation of the binary tree.

2. ** Deserialization:**
   - Split the Serialization string into a list of strings based on " null ".
   - Use a recursive function to construct the binary tree from the list.
   - The recursive function will take a list of strings and an index to keep track of the current position in the list.
   - If the current string at the index is " null ", return null.
   - If the current string at the index is not " null ", create a new node with the value of the string and recursively construct the left and right subtrees.
   - Return the root node of the constructed tree.

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the length of the longest **consecutive sequence path**_.

A **consecutive sequence path** is a path where the values **increase by one** along the path.

Note that the path can start **at any node** in the tree, and you cannot go from a node to its parent in the path.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,null,3,2,4,null,null,null,5\]

**Explanation:** Longest consecutive sequence path is 3-4-5, so return 3.

**Example 2:**

**Explanation:** Longest consecutive sequence path is 2-3, not 3-2-1, so return 2.

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 104]`.
*   `-3 * 104 <= Node.val <= 3 * 104`

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the length of the longest consecutive sequence path in a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will keep track of the longest consecutive sequence path found so far and update it as we traverse the tree.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Define a function ` longConsecutivePath `** that takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns the length of the longest consecutive sequence path.

2. ** Initialize a variable ` max_length ` ** to 0. This variable will store the length of the longest consecutive sequence path found so far.

3. ** Define a helper function ` dfs ` ** that takes a node and its parent value as input. This function will return the length of the longest consecutive sequence path starting from the given node.

4. ** In the ` dfs ` function:**
   - If the node is ` None`, return 0.
   - If the value of the node is equal to the parent value + 1, then the current path is consecutive. Otherwise, the current path is not consecutive.
   - Recursively call ` dfs ` on the left and right children of the node.
   - Update the ` max_length ` by taking the maximum of the current path length and the sum of the lengths of the consecutive paths from the children plus 1 (if the current path is consecutive).

5. ** In the ` longConsecutivePath ` function:**
   - If the root is ` None`, return 0.
   - Otherwise, call the ` dfs ` function on the root with a parent value of ` None`.
   - Return the ` max_length `.

Here is the Python code implementing the above approach:
Response: python
class binaryTree:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self value = value
        self left = None
        self right = None

def longConsecutivePath(root):
    if root is None:
        return 0

    max_length = 0

    def dfs(node, parent_value):
        if node is None:
            return 0

        if node value == parent_value + 1:
            current_length = 1 + dfs(node left, node value) + dfs(node right, node value)
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)

        else:
            current_length = max(dfs(node left, node value), dfs(node right, node value))

        return current_length

    return dfs(root, None)

# Example usage
root = binaryTree(1)

Original Question: You are playing the **[Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows)** game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

*   The number of "bulls ", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
*   The number of "cows ", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

Given the secret number `secret` and your friend's guess `guess`, return _the hint for your friend's guess_.

The hint should be formatted as `"xAyB "`, where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows. Note that both `secret` and `guess` may contain duplicate digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** secret =  "1807 ", guess =  "7810 "
**Output:**  "1A3B "
**Explanation:** Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
 "1807 "
  |
 "7810 "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** secret =  "1123 ", guess =  "0111 "
**Output:**  "1A1B "
**Explanation:** Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
 "1123 "         "1123 "
  |      or     |
 "0111 "         "0111 "
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000`

CoT: To solve the problem of determining the hint for the friend's guess in the Bulls and Cows game, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the Bulls:**
   - Iterate through both the `secret` and `guess` strings.
   - If the characters at the same position in both strings are the same, it is a bull.
   - Keep a count of the number of bulls.

2. **Count the Cows:**
   - Create a frequency map for the digits in the `secret` string.
   - Iterate through the `guess` string and check if each digit is in the frequency map.
   - If a digit is in the frequency map and it has not been used as a bull yet, it is a cow.
   - Keep a count of the number of cows.

3. ** format the Hint:**
   - Combine the counts of bulls and cows into a string in the format "xAyB".

CoT: To find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in an integer array `nums`, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create an array `dp` of the same length as `nums` and initialize all elements to 1. This array will store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index.

2. **Iterate through the array:**
   - For each element `nums[i]` in the array, iterate through all previous elements `nums[j]` where `j < i`.
   - If `nums[i] > nums[j]`, it means `nums[i]` can extend the increasing subsequence ending at `nums[j]`. Therefore, update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

3. **Find the maximum length:**
   - After iterating through the entire array, the maximum value in the `dp` array will be the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
CoT: To solve the problem of removing the minimum number of invalid parentheses to make a string valid, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will keep track of the number of open parentheses and close parentheses as we iterate through the string. If we encounter a close parentheses before an open parentheses, it means the close parentheses is invalid and we can consider removing it. We will explore all possible combinations of removing parentheses and keep track of the valid strings we find.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define a function `is_valid(s)` to check if a string `s` is valid.**
   - Initialize two counters, `open` and `close`, to keep track of the number of open and close parentheses.
   - Iterate through the string `s`.
     - If we encounter an open parentheses, increment `open`.
     - If we encounter a close parentheses, increment `close`.
     - If `close` is greater than `open` at any point, the string is invalid.
   - After iterating through the string, if `open` is equal to `close`, the string is valid. Otherwise, it is invalid.

2. **Define a function `DFS(s, open, close, path)` to perform depth-first search.**
   - If `open` is equal to `close` and `s` is empty, we have found a valid string. Add `path` to the result list.
   - If `open` is less than `close`, we can remove a close parentheses. Recursively call `DFS` with `s` excluding the last character, `open`, `close - 1`, and `path + s[-1]`.
   - If `open` is greater than or equal to `close`, we can remove an open parentheses. Recursively call `DFS` with `s` excluding the last character, `open - 1`, `close`, and `path + s[-1]`.

3. **Define the main function `min_parentheses_removal(s)`.**

Original Question: You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `image` where `0` represents a white pixel and `1` represents a black pixel.

The black pixels are connected (i.e., there is only one black region). Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically.

Given two integers `x` and `y` that represents the location of one of the black pixels, return _the area of the smallest (axis-aligned) rectangle that encloses all black pixels_.

You must write an algorithm with less than `O(mn)` runtime complexity

**Example 1:**

**Input:** image = \[\[ "0 ", "0 ", "1 ", "0 "\],\[ "0 ", "1 ", "1 ", "0 "\],\[ "0 ", "1 ", "0 ", "0 "\]\], x = 0, y = 2
**Output:** 6

**Example 2:**

**Input:** image = \[\[ "1 "\]\], x = 0, y = 0
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `m == image.length`
*   `n == image[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 100`
*   `image[i][j]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
*   `0 <= x < m`
*   `0 <= y < n`
*   `image[x][y] == '1'.`
*   The black pixels in the `image` only form **one component**.
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `image` where `0` represents a white pixel and `1` represents a black pixel. The black pixels are connected (i.e., there is only one black region). Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically.

CoT: To find the area of the smallest axis-aligned rectangle that encloses all black pixels in the given binary matrix, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the coordinates of all black pixels**: We will iterate through the matrix and keep track of the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the black pixels.

2. **Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices**: As we iterate through the matrix, we will update the minimum and maximum row and column indices whenever we encounter a black pixel.

3. **Calculate the area of the rectangle**: Once we have the minimum and maximum row and column indices, we can calculate the width and height of the rectangle and then find the area.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
def min_area rectangle(image, x, y):
    m = len(image)
    n = len(image[0])
    min_row, max_row = m, -1
    min_col, max_col = n, -1

    # Iterate through the matrix to find the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the black pixels
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if image[i][j] == '1':
                min_row = min(min_row, i)
                max_row = max(max_row, i)
                min_col = min(min_col, j)
                max_col = max(max_col, j)

    # Calculate the width and height of the rectangle
    width = max_col - min_col + 1
    height = max_row - min_row + 1

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = width * height

    return area

# Example 1
image1 = [
    ['0', '0', '1', '0'],
    ['0', '1', '1', '0'],
    ['0', '1', '0', '0']
]
x1, y1 = 0, 2

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums`, handle multiple queries of the following type:

1.  Calculate the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** where `left <= right`.

Implement the `NumArray` class:

*   `NumArray(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer array `nums`.
*   `int sumRange(int left, int right)` Returns the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** (i.e. `nums[left] + nums[left + 1] + ... + nums[right]`).

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "NumArray ",  "sumRange ",  "sumRange ",  "sumRange "\]
\[\[\[-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1\]\], \[0, 2\], \[2, 5\], \[0, 5\]\]
**Output**
\[null, 1, -1, -3\]

**Explanation**
NumArray numArray = new NumArray(\[-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1\]);
numArray.sumRange(0, 2); // return (-2) + 0 + 3 = 1
numArray.sumRange(2, 5); // return 3 + (-5) + 2 + (-1) = -1

CoT: To efficiently handle multiple range sum queries on an integer array `nums`, we can use the concept of prefix sums. A prefix sum array `prefixSums` is an array where `prefixSums[i]` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `nums`. This allows us to calculate the sum of any range `left` to `right` in constant time by using the formula `sumRange(left, right) = prefixSums[right] - prefixSums[left-1]`. If `left` is 0, then the sum is simply `prefixSums[right]`.

def __init__(self, nums):
    self prefixSums = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)
    for i in range(1, len(nums) + 1):

Original Question: Given a 2D matrix `matrix`, handle multiple queries of the following type:

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a technique called **prefix sums**. We will precompute the sum of all elements in the submatrix that starts from the top-left corner and ends at any given point. This way, we can answer each sum region query in constant time by subtracting the appropriate prefix sums.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the prefix sum matrix:**
   - Create a new matrix `prefix_sum` with the same dimensions as `matrix`.
   - For each element in `prefix_sum`, calculate the sum of all elements in `matrix` that are above and to the left of it, including itself.

2. **Calculate the sum of the elements in the specified rectangle:**
   - To find the sum of the elements in the rectangle defined by its upper left corner `(row1, col1)` and lower right corner `(row2, col2)`, we use the following formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \text{prefix_sum[row2][col2]} - \text{prefix_sum[row1-1][col2]} - \text{prefix_sum[row2][col1-1]} + \text{prefix_sum[row1-1][col1-1]}
     \]
   - This formula works because it adds the sum of all elements in the rectangle, subtracts the sum of the elements above the rectangle, subtracts the sum of the elements to the left of the rectangle, and then adds back the sum of the elements at the top-left corner of the rectangle (which was subtracted twice).

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
import numpy as np

def NumMatrix(matrix):
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    prefix_sum = np.zeros((m+1, n+1), dtype=int)
    
    # Initialize the prefix sum matrix
    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            prefix_sum[i][j] = matrix[i-1][j-1] + prefix_sum[i-1][j] + prefix_sum[i][j-1] - prefix_sum[i-1][j-1]
    
    self prefix_sum = prefix_sum

def sumRegion(self, row1, col1, row2, col2):

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
Original Question: You are given an empty 2D binary grid `grid` of size `m x n`. The grid represents a map where `0`'s represent water and `1`'s represent land. Initially, all the cells of `grid` are water cells (i.e., all the cells are `0`'s).

We may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land. You are given an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [ri, ci]` is the position `(ri, ci)` at which we should operate the `ith` operation.

Return _an array of integers_ `answer` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the number of islands after turning the cell_ `(ri, ci)` _into a land_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 3, positions = \[\[0,0\],\[0,1\],\[1,2\],\[2,1\]\]
**Output:** \[1,1,2,3\]
**Explanation:**
Initially, the 2d grid is filled with water.
- Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid\[0\]\[0\] into a land. We have 1 island.
- Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid\[0\]\[1\] into a land. We still have 1 island.
- Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid\[1\]\[2\] into a land. We have 2 islands.
- Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid\[2\]\[1\] into a land. We have 3 islands.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 1, n = 1, positions = \[\[0,0\]\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= m, n, positions.length <= 104`
*   `1 <= m * n <= 104`
*   `positions[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= ri < m`
*   `0 <= ci < n`

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a Union Find algorithm to keep track of the connected components (islands) in the grid. Each time we add a land cell, we check if it is adjacent to any existing land cells and合并 the corresponding components if it is.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the Union Find data structure**: Create an array `root` of size `m * n` where each element points to itself. Also, create an array ` size` of size `m * n` where each element represents the size of the component (initially 1 for each cell since each cell is a separate island).

2. **Define the union function**: This function will union two components by making the root of one component point to the root of the other component and update the size of the resulting component.

3. **Define the find function**: This function will find the root of a component and path_compression to compress the tree.

4. ** Process each position in the positions array**: For each position \((r, c)\), convert it to a flat index `i` using the formula `i = r * n + c`. Then, union this cell with its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) if they are land cells (i.e., their flat indices are in the positions array).

5. **Return the result**: After processing all positions, the size of each component in the `size` array represents the number of islands after adding the corresponding land cell. Return these sizes as a list.

Here is the Python code implementing the above steps:

CoT: To determine if a given string is an additive number, we need to check if its digits can form an additive sequence. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Define a function to check if a sequence is additive:**
   - We need to check if the digits in the string can form a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
   - We will use a loop to iterate through the string and check if the sequence is valid.

2. **Convert the string to a list of integers:**
   - We will convert the string to a list of integers to make it easier to work with.

3. **Check the length of the list:**
   - If the length of the list is less than 3, it cannot form an additive sequence. Return `False`.

4. **Check the first two numbers:**
   - The first two numbers in the sequence must be valid integers without leading zeros.

5. **Check the remaining numbers:**
   - For each subsequent number in the sequence, check if it is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
   - If any number is not the sum of the two preceding numbers, return `False`.

6. **Return the result:**
   - If the entire sequence is valid, return `True`.

Here's the Python code to implement this approach:
Response: python
def is_additive_number(num_str):
    # Convert the string to a list of integers
    num_list = [int(digit) for digit in num_str]

    # Check the length of the list
    if len(num_list) < 3:
        return False

    # Check the first two numbers
    if num_list[0] == 0 or num_list[1] == 0:
        return False

    # Check the remaining numbers
    for i in range(2, len(num_list)):
        if num_list[i]!= num_list[i-1] + num_list[i-2]:
            return False

    # If the entire sequence is valid, return True
    return True

# Example usage
print(is_additive_number("112358"))  # Output: True

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums`, handle multiple queries of the following types:

1.  **Update** the value of an element in `nums`.
2.  Calculate the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** where `left <= right`.

Implement the `NumArray` class:

*   `NumArray(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer array `nums`.
*   `void update(int index, int val)` **Updates** the value of `nums[index]` to be `val`.
*   `int sumRange(int left, int right)` Returns the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** (i.e. `nums[left] + nums[left + 1] + ... + nums[right]`).

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "NumArray ",  "sumRange ",  "update ",  "sumRange "\]
\[\[\[1, 3, 5\]\], \[0, 2\], \[1, 2\], \[0, 2\]\]
**Output**
\[null, 9, null, 8\]

**Explanation**
NumArray numArray = new NumArray(\[1, 3, 5\]);
numArray.sumRange(0, 2); // return 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
numArray.update(1, 2);   // nums = \[1, 2, 5\]
numArray.sumRange(0, 2); // return 1 + 2 + 5 = 8

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
*   `0 <= index < nums.length`
*   `-100 <= val <= 100`
*   `0 <= left <= right < nums.length`
*   At most `3 * 104` calls will be made to `update` and `sumRange`.
Attacked Question: Considering the aforementioned details, Given an integer array `nums`, handle multiple queries of the following types: 1. **Update** the value of an element in `nums`. 2. Calculate the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** where `left <= right`. Implement the `NumArray` class: * `NumArray(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer array `nums`. * `void update(int index, int val)` **Updates** the value of `nums[index]` to be `val`. * `int sumRange(int left, int right)` Returns the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** (i.e. `nums[left] + nums[left + 1] + ... + nums[right]`). **Example 1:** **Input** \[ "NumArray ", "sumRange ", "update ", "sumRange "\] \[\[\[1, 3, 5\]\], \[0, 2\], \[1, 2\], \[0, 2\]\] **Output** \[null, 9, null, 8\] **Explanation** NumArray numArray = new NumArray(\[1, 3, 5\]); numArray.sumRange(0, 2); // return 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 numArray.update(1, 2); // nums = \[1, 2, 5\] numArray.sumRange(0, 2); // return 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 **Constraints:** * `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104` * `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100` * `0 <= index < nums.length` * `-100 <= val <= 100` * `0 <= left <= right < nums.length` * At most `3 * 104` calls will be made to `update` and `sumRange`.
CoT: To efficiently handle the given queries, we can use a segment tree. A segment tree is a binary tree where each node represents a range of the array. The root node represents the entire array, and each child node represents a sub-range of the array. This structure allows us to perform range sum queries and update values in logarithmic time.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Initialize the segment tree:**
   - The segment tree can be built in a bottom-up manner. Each non-leaf node is the sum of its two children.
   - The leaves of the tree represent the elements of the array.

2. **Update a value:**
   - To update the value at index `i` to `val`, we need to update all the nodes that represent ranges containing index `i`.
   - We start from the root and follow the path to the leaf node representing index `i`. At each node, we check if the range of the node contains index `i`. If it does, we update the value of the node to the sum of its children after updating the value of the child that represents the range containing index `i`.

3. **Calculate the sum of a range:**
   - To calculate the sum of the elements between indices `left` and `right`, we need to find the sum of the nodes that represent ranges within this range.
   - We start from the root and follow the path to the leaves. At each node, we check if the range of the node is completely within the range `left` to `right`. If it is, we add the value of the node to the sum. If it is not, we recursively check its children.

Here is the Python code for the solution:

Original Question: Given a 2D matrix `matrix`, handle multiple queries of the following types:

2.  Calculate the **sum** of the elements of `matrix` inside the rectangle defined by its **upper left corner** `(row1, col1)` and **lower right corner** `(row2, col2)`.

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a 2D prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of elements in a rectangular region and update the value of a cell. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the prefix sum array**: Create a 2D array `prefix_sum` where `prefix_sum[i][j]` represents the sum of all elements in the submatrix from `(0, 0)` to `(i, j)`. This can be computed using the formula:
   \[
   prefix_sum[i][j] = matrix[i][j] + prefix_sum[i-1][j] + prefix_sum[i][j-1] - prefix_sum[i-1][j-1]
   \]
   where `prefix_sum[-1][j] = 0` and `prefix_sum[i][-1] = 0` for all `i` and `j`.

2. **Update the matrix**: When a cell `(row, col)` is updated to a new value `val`, we need to update the prefix sum array accordingly. We do this by updating the prefix sum for all cells in the submatrix from `(0, 0)` to `(row, col)`.

3. **Calculate the sum of a rectangular region**: To find the sum of the elements in the rectangle defined by its upper left corner `(row1, col1)` and lower right corner `(row2, col2)`, we use the formula:
   \[
   sum = prefix_sum[row2][col2] - prefix_sum[row2][col1-1] - prefix_sum[row1-1][col2] + prefix_sum[row1-1][col1-1]
   \]
   where `prefix_sum[-1][j] = 0` and `prefix_sum[i][-1] = 0` for all `i` and `j`.

Here's the Python code to implement this solution:

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We define two arrays, `dp_buy` and `dp_sell`, where `dp_buy[i]` is the maximum profit we can achieve on day `i` if we buy the stock on that day, and `dp_sell[i]` is the maximum profit we can achieve on day `i` if we sell the stock on that day. The key is to update these arrays based on the given constraints.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize `dp_buy` and `dp_sell` arrays with zeros.
2. For each day `i` from 1 to `n`:
   - `dp_buy[i]` can be either `dp_buy[i-1]` (if we don't buy the stock on day `i`) or `dp_sell[i-2] - prices[i]` (if we sell the stock on day `i` and bought it on day `i-2`).

Original Question: A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by _exactly_ one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`) are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs).

Return _a list of all **MHTs'** root labels_. You can return the answer in **any order**.

The **height** of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = \[\[1,0\],\[1,2\],\[1,3\]\]
**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 6, edges = \[\[3,0\],\[3,1\],\[3,2\],\[3,4\],\[5,4\]\]
**Output:** \[3,4\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
*   `edges.length == n - 1`

*   `ai != bi`
*   All the pairs `(ai, bi)` are distinct.

CoT: To find all minimum height trees (MHTs) in a given tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to calculate the height of each node when it is considered as the root. The height of a node is the maximum height of its children plus one. The minimum height of the tree is the minimum height among all the heights calculated when each node is considered as the root.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Construct the tree**: Create an adjacency list to represent the tree based on the given edges.
2. **Calculate the height of each node**: Perform a DFS to calculate the height of each node when it is considered as the root. Keep track of the minimum height found and the nodes that have this minimum height.
3. **Return the roots of the MHTs**: Return a list of all nodes that have the minimum height.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def find_mht_roots(n, edges):
    # Step 1: Construct the tree
    adj_list = [ [] for _ in range(n) ]
    for edge in edges:
        adj_list[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
        adj_list[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the height of each node
    heights = [0] * n
    min_height = float('inf')
    roots = []
    
    def dfs(node, parent):
        height = 0
        for child in adj_list[node]:
            if child!= parent:
                height = max(height, dfs(child, node) + 1)
        heights[node] = height
        if height < min_height:
            min_height = height
            roots = [node]
        elif height == min_height:
            roots.append(node)
    
    for i in range(n):
        dfs(i, -1)
    
    # Step 3: Return the roots of the MHTs
    return roots

# Example 1
n1 = 4
edges1 = [[1,0], [1,2], [1,3]]

If you burst the `ith` balloon, you will get `nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1]` coins. If `i - 1` or `i + 1` goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a `1` painted on it.

Given an integer `n` and an array of integers `primes`, return _the_ `nth` _**super ugly number**_.

The `nth` **super ugly number** is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** signed integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 12, primes = \[2,7,13,19\]
**Output:** 32
**Explanation:** \[1,2,4,7,8,13,14,16,19,26,28,32\] is the sequence of the first 12 super ugly numbers given primes = \[2,7,13,19\].

**Example 2:**

CoT: To find the \(n\)-th super ugly number given an array of prime numbers, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will maintain a list of super ugly numbers and generate them in ascending order.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the list of super ugly numbers**: Start with the number 1, as it is the smallest super ugly number.
2. **Generate the next super ugly number**: For each new super ugly number, we multiply the smallest super ugly number by each prime in the array and take the smallest result that has not been seen before.
3. **Repeat until we have the \(n\)-th super ugly number**: Continue this process until we have generated \(n\) super ugly numbers.

    # Initialize the list of super ugly numbers with the first one
    super_ugly = [1]
    
    # Create a set to keep track of the numbers we have seen
    seen = set([1])
    
    # Generate the next super ugly number until we have n of them
    for _ in range(1, n):
        next_ugly = float('inf')

                seen.add(new_number)
        super_ugly.append(next_ugly)
    
    return super_ugly[-1]

# Example 1

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the vertical order traversal of a binary tree, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach with a queue to keep track of the nodes and their positions. We will use a dictionary to store the positions of the nodes in a 2D grid, where the key is the column and the value is a list of nodes in that column.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the dictionary**: Create an empty dictionary to store the positions of the nodes.
2. **Perform BFS**: Start a BFS from the root node. During the BFS, keep track of the current column for each node. When a node is dequeued, add its value to the list in the dictionary corresponding to its column. If the column is not already in the dictionary, create a new list for that column.
3. ** Extract the result**: After the BFS is complete, extract the values from the dictionary in order of the columns. If a column has multiple nodes, the nodes should be in left-to-right order.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of smaller elements to the right of each element in an integer array `nums`, we can use a data structure called a binary search tree ( Specifically, a binary search tree with order statistic properties, such as a red-black tree or a balanced binary search tree). However, for simplicity and efficiency, we can use a segment tree or a binary indexed tree (Fenwick tree) to solve this problem.

Here, we will use a binary indexed tree (Fenwick tree) to solve the problem. A binary indexed tree is a data structure that allows us to perform range sum queries and update operations in logarithmic time.

Let's break down the solution step by step:

1. **Initialize the binary indexed tree:**
   We need to create a binary indexed tree with a size equal to the maximum value in the array plus one (to handle negative values).

2. **Update the binary indexed tree:**
   For each element in the array, we need to update the binary indexed tree to indicate that this element has been encountered.

3. ** 查找 the number of smaller elements:**
   For each element in the array, we need to find the sum of the elements in the binary indexed tree that are less than the current element. This can be done by performing a range sum query from 1 to the current element minus 1.

4. **Update the binary indexed tree after each query:**
   After finding the number of smaller elements for each element, we need to update the binary indexed tree to indicate that this element has been encountered.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def binary_indexed_tree(n):
    tree = [0] * (n + 1)
    return tree

def update tree(tree, index, value):

3. **For each character, check if it is already in the stack.**
