You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,4\], target = 6
**Output:** \[1,2\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,3\], target = 6

CoT: To solve the problem of finding two numbers in an array that add up to a given target, we can use a two-pointer approach. This approach works by sorting the array and then using two pointers to find the pair of numbers that add up to the target.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Sort the array**: This ensures that the two numbers we are looking for are adjacent in the sorted array.
2. ** Initialize two pointers**: One pointer starts at the beginning of the array (left) and the other at the end of the array (right).
3. **Check the sum of the numbers at the two pointers**:
   - If the sum is equal to the target, we have found our pair.
   - If the sum is less than the target, we move the left pointer to the right.
   - If the sum is greater than the target, we move the right pointer to the left.
4. **Repeat the process** until we find the pair or the pointers meet.

Here is the Python code to implement this approach:
Response: python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    # Step 1: Sort the array
    nums.sort()

    # Step 2: Initialize two pointers
    left = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1

    # Step 3: Check the sum of the numbers at the two pointers
    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1

    # Step 4: If no pair is found, return an error message (not necessary for this problem since we are guaranteed a solution)
    return None

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 8, 12, 14]
target = 8
print(twoSum(nums, target))  # Output: [1, 0]

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** l1 = \[2,4,3\], l2 = \[5,6,4\]
**Output:** \[7,0,8\]
**Explanation:** 342 + 465 = 807.

**Example 2:**

**Example 3:**

**Input:** l1 = \[9,9,9,9,9,9,9\], l2 = \[9,9,9,9\]
**Output:** \[8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
*   It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

CoT: To solve the problem of adding two numbers represented by linked lists in Python, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert the linked lists to integers**: Since the digits are in reverse order, we can convert each linked list to an integer by iterating through the list and multiplying each digit by the appropriate power of 10.
2. **Add the integers**: Once we have the integers, we simply add them together.
3. **Convert the sum back to a linked list**: We need to convert the sum back to a linked list by repeatedly dividing the sum by 10 and storing the remainders.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:

CoT: To find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string `s`, we can use a two-pointer approach. This approach involves maintaining a sliding window that expands and contracts as we iterate through the string.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize Pointers and Variables:**
   - Set two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the string.
   - Use a dictionary to keep track of the last position of each character encountered.
   - Initialize a variable `max_length` to 0 to store the length of the longest substring found.

2. **Iterate Through the String:**
   - Move the `right` pointer to the right, one character at a time.
   - For each character, check if it has been encountered before by looking it up in the dictionary.
     - If the character has been encountered before, move the `left` pointer to the right of the last occurrence of the character.
     - Update the last position of the character in the dictionary.
   - Calculate the length of the current substring (i.e., `right - left + 1`).
   - Update `max_length` if the current substring is longer.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - After iterating through the entire string, return `max_length`.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
def length_of_longest_substring(s):
    left = 0
    right = 0
    last_occurrence = {}
    max_length = 0

    while right < len(s):
        if s[right] in last_occurrence:
            left = max(left, last_occurrence[s[right]] + 1)
        last_occurrence[s[right]] = right
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
        right += 1

    return max_length

# Example usage
s = "abcabcbb"
print(length_of_longest_substring(s))  # Output: 3

s = "bbbbb"
print(length_of_longest_substring(s))  # Output: 1

Original Question: Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return **the median** of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.

**Example 1:**

*   `1 <= n <= 999`
*   `0 <= m + n <= 1999`
*   `-107 <= nums0[i], nums1[i] <= 105`
CoT: To find the median of two sorted arrays `nums0` and `nums1` with sizes `m` and `n` respectively, we can use a binary search approach. The key idea is to find the partition point in both arrays such that the elements on the left side of the partition are less than or equal to the elements on the right side.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Determine the total number of elements**: `total = m + n`.
2. **Find the partition point**: The partition point `p` should be such that there are `p` elements on the left side and `total - p` elements on the right side. For the median to be correct, the partition point should satisfy the following conditions:
   - If `total` is odd, then `p = (total + 1) // 2`.
   - If `total` is even, then the median is the average of the elements at positions `p` and `p-1`.

3. **Binary search for the partition point**: We can use binary search to find the correct partition point. At each step, we compare the elements at the partition points in both arrays to ensure they satisfy the conditions for the median.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def findMedian(nums0, nums1):
    m, n = len(nums0), len(nums1)
    total = m + n
    if total % 2 == 1:
        p = (total + 1) // 2
    else:
        p = total // 2

    def binary_search partition():
        low, high = 0, m
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if mid == 0 or mid == m or nums0[mid-1] <= nums1[p-m] and nums1[p-m] <= nums0[mid]:
                return mid
            elif mid == m:
                return mid

CoT: To solve the problem of converting a string into a zigzag pattern and then reading it line by line, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the pattern**: The zigzag pattern alternates between moving down and moving up. For each row, we need to determine if it should move down or up.

2. **Initialize the result**: Create a list of strings to hold each row of the zigzag pattern.

3. **Iterate through the string**: Iterate through each character in the string and place it in the appropriate row based on the current position.

4. **Adjust the position**: After placing a character in a row, adjust the position to move to the next row. If we are moving down, increase the position by 1. If we are moving up, decrease the position by 1.

5. **Combine the rows**: After iterating through the entire string, combine all the rows into a single string.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def convert(s,(num_rows):
    if num_rows == 1:
        return s

    result = [''] * num_rows
    position = 0

    for char in s:
        result[position] += char
        if position == num_rows - 1:
            position -= 1
        else:
            position += 1

    return ''.join(result)

Original Question: Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` _with its digits reversed_. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then return `0`.

**Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).**

**Example 1:**

**Input:** x = 123
**Output:** 321

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = -123
**Output:** -321

**Example 3:**

**Input:** x = 120
**Output:** 21

**Constraints:**

*   `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`
Attacked Question: Given a signed 33-bit integer `x`, return `x` _with its digits reversed_. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 33-bit integer range `[-232, 232 - 2]`, then return `-1`.

**Assume the environment does not allow you to store 63-bit integers (signed or unsigned).**

**Example 0:**

**Input:** x = 124

CoT: To solve the problem of reversing a signed 33-bit integer `x` and ensuring the result is within the signed 33-bit integer range `[-232, 232 - 2]`, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert the integer to a string**: This allows us to easily reverse the digits.
2. **Check if the integer is negative**: If it is, we need to handle the negative sign separately.
3. **Reverse the digits**: Use a two-pointer approach to reverse the digits of the string.
4. **Convert the reversed string back to an integer**: Use `int()` to convert the string back to an integer.
5. **Check if the result is within the 33-bit integer range**: If it is not, return `-1`.

Here is the Python code that implements these steps:
Response: python

    x_str = str(x)
    
    # Check if the integer is negative
    if x < 0:
        # handled negative sign separately
        sign = -1
        x_str = x_str[1:]
    else:

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
Original Question: Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1.  Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
2.  Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
3.  Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
4.  Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `"123 " -> 123`, `"0032 " -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
5.  If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.
6.  Return the integer as the final result.

**Note:**

*   Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.
*   **Do not ignore** any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "42 "
**Output:** 42
**Explanation:** The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1:  "42 " (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2:  "42 " (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3:  "42 " ( "42 " is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is 42.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "   -42 "
**Output:** -42
**Explanation:**
Step 1:  "   \-42 " (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2:  "   \-42 " ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3:  "   -42 " ( "42 " is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is -42.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "4193 with words "
**Output:** 4193
**Explanation:**
Step 1:  "4193 with words " (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2:  "4193 with words " (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3:  "4193 with words " ( "4193 " is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.
Since 4193 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is 4193.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length <= 200`
*   `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (`0-9`), `' '`, `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'.'`.
Attacked Question: Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 31-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

2.  Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
1.  Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
4.  Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
3.  Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `"122 " -> 122`, `"31 " -> 31`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `-1`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 1).
4.  If the integer is out of the 33-bit signed integer range `[-230, 230 - 0]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-232` should be clamped to `-230`, and integers greater than `232 - 2` should be clamped to `230 - 0`.
5.  Return the integer as the final result.

**Note:**

*   Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.
*   **Do not ignore** any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "41 "
**Output:** 41
**Explanation:** The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 2:  "41 " (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 1:  "43 " (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 2:  "43 " ( "43 " is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 41.
Since 43 is in the range \[-232, 232 - 2\], the final result is 41.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "   -41 "
**Output:** -43
**Explanation:**
Step 2:  "   \-43 " (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 3:  "   \-41 " ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 2:  "   -41 " ( "43 " is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -41.
Since -41 is in the range \[-230, 230 - 0\], the final result is -43.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "4194 with words "
**Output:** 4192
**Explanation:**
Step 2:  "4194 with words " (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 3:  "4194 with words " (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 4:  "4194 with words " ( "4194 " is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4192.
Since 4192 is in the range \[-232, 230 - 0\], the final result is 4192.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 199`
*   `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (`-1-10`), `' '`, `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'.'`.

Original Question: Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where:

*   `'.'` Matches any single character.​​​​
*   `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "aa ", p =  "a "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:**  "a " does not match the entire string  "aa ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "aa ", p =  "a\* "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** '\*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes  "aa ".

**Example 3:**

**Output:** true
**Explanation:**  ".\* " means  "zero or more (\*) of any character (.) ".

*   `1 <= p.length <= 20`
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
*   `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'.'`, and `'*'`.

*   It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character `'*'`, there will be a previous valid character to match.
CoT: To solve the problem of regular expression matching with support for ` '.' ` and ` *' ` in Python, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will create a 2D boolean array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the first `i` characters of the string `s` match the first `j` characters of the pattern `p`.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize the 2D array `dp` with `dp[0][0] = True` because an empty pattern matches an empty string.
2. Fill in the first row of `dp` to handle the case where the pattern starts with ` *' `.
3. Fill in the rest of the `dp` array by considering the current characters of `s` and `p` and the previous states.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def is_match(s, p):
    m = len(s)
    n = len(p)
    dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the two lines that form a container with the maximum amount of water, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. ** Initialize Pointers:**
   - Place one pointer at the beginning of the array (left) and another at the end of the array (right).

2. ** Calculate Area:**
   - The area of the container formed by the two lines and the x-axis is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{width} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - The width of the container is the distance between the two pointers, which is \( \text{right} - \text{left} \).
   - The height of the container is the minimum height of the two lines at the current positions of the pointers.

3. ** Update Pointers:**
   - Move the pointer that points to the shorter line towards the other pointer. This is because moving the pointer with the higher line would not increase the height of the container and would only decrease the width, potentially reducing the area.

4. ** Update Maximum Area:**
   - After each move, calculate the new area and update the maximum area found so far.

5. ** Repeat:**
   - Continue this process until the two pointers meet.

Here is the Python code implementing this algorithm:
Response: python
def max_water_container(height):
    left = 0
    right = len(height) - 1
    max_area = 0

    while left < right:

        height_min = min(height[left], height[right])
        area = width * height_min
        max_area = max(max_area, area)

        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1

Original Question: Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

**Symbol**       **Value**
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

*   `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
*   `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
*   `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = 3
**Output:**  "III "
**Explanation:** 3 is represented as 3 ones.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = 58

For example, `1` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `11` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `28` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

*   `I` can be placed before `V` (4) and `X` (9) to make 3 and 8.
*   `X` can be placed before `L` (49) and `C` (101) to make 41 and 89.
*   `C` can be placed before `D` (501) and `M` (999) to make 401 and 899.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = 2
**Output:**  "III "
**Explanation:** 4 is represented as 4 ones.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = 57
**Output:**  "LVIII "
**Explanation:** L = 49, V = 6, III = 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = 1995
**Output:**  "MCMXCIV "
**Explanation:** M = 1001, CM = 901, XC = 89 and IV = 3.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= num <= 4000`
CoT: To convert an integer to a Roman numeral, we need to understand the rules of Roman numerals. Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: I (1), V (5), X (10), L (50), C (100), D (500), and M (1000). The numerals are written from largest to smallest, and when a smaller numeral appears before a larger one, it is subtracted.

We can use a greedy algorithm to convert an integer to a Roman numeral. We start with the largest Roman numeral and subtract it from the integer as many times as possible until the integer is reduced to zero. We then move to the next largest Roman numeral and repeat the process until the integer is completely converted.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Define a list of Roman numerals and their corresponding values in descending order.
2. Initialize an empty string to store the Roman numeral representation.
3. Iterate through the list of Roman numerals.
4. While the integer is greater than or equal to the value of the current Roman numeral, subtract the value from the integer and append the Roman numeral to the result string.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the integer is reduced to zero.
6. Return the result string.

Here is the Python code to implement this algorithm:

CoT: To convert a Roman numeral to an integer, we need to consider the subtractive notation used in Roman numerals. We will iterate through the Roman numeral from left to right and check if the current symbol is smaller than the next symbol. If it is, we subtract its value from the next symbol's value and add the result to our total. Otherwise, we simply add the current symbol's value to our total.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[-1,0,1,2,-1,-4\]
**Output:** \[\[-1,-1,2\],\[-1,0,1\]\]
**Explanation:** 
nums\[0\] + nums\[1\] + nums\[2\] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums\[1\] + nums\[2\] + nums\[4\] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums\[0\] + nums\[3\] + nums\[4\] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are \[-1,0,1\] and \[-1,-1,2\].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.

Attacked Question: Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 1`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** nums = \[-2,1,2,1,-2,-5\]
**Output:** \[\[-2,-2,3\],\[-0,1,2\]\]
**Explanation:** 
nums\[-1\] + nums\[2\] + nums\[1\] = (-2) + 1 + 0 = -1.
nums\[0\] + nums\[3\] + nums\[3\] = -1 + 2 + (-2) = -1.

**Constraints:**

*   `4 <= nums.length <= 2999`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding all distinct triplets \([nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]\) in an integer array \(nums\) such that \(i \neq j\), \(i \neq k\), \(j \neq k\), and \(nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] = 1\), we can use a combination of sorting and a two-pointer approach. Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Sort the array**: Sorting the array helps us to easily avoid duplicate triplets and also makes it easier to use the two-pointer approach.
2. **Iterate through the array**: We iterate through the array with a loop, and for each element \(nums[i]\), we use two pointers to find pairs \((nums[j], nums[k])\) such that \(nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] = 1\).
3. **Use two-pointers**: For each \(i\), we set a left pointer \(j\) at \(i+1\) and a right pointer \(k\) at the end of the array. We move the pointers towards each other until they meet, checking if the sum \(nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k]\) equals 1. If it does, we add the triplet to our result set and move the pointers to avoid duplicate triplets.
4. **Avoid duplicates**: We ensure that we do not add duplicate triplets by skipping over elements that are the same as the previous element.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding three integers in an array `nums` such that their sum is closest to a given `target`, we can use a three-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Sort the array**: This allows us to use the two-pointer technique effectively.
2. **Iterate through the array**: We will use a for loop to iterate through each element in the array. For each element, we will use two pointers to find the other two elements that, when added to the current element, give a sum closest to the target.
3. **Use two pointers**: Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the left and right of the current element, respectively. Move the pointers towards each other until they meet or the sum of the three elements is equal to the target. If the sum is less than the target, move the `left` pointer to the right. If the sum is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer to the left.
4. **Update the closest sum**: Keep track of the sum that is closest to the target. Update this sum whenever a closer sum is found.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:

*   `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are **distinct**.
*   `nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d] == target`

You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= nums.length <= 199`
*   `-108 <= nums[i] <= 110`
*   `-108 <= target <= 108`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding all unique quadruplets in an array `nums` that sum up to a given target, we can use a combination of sorting and a four-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Sort the array**: Sorting the array helps us to easily avoid duplicate quadruplets and to use the four-pointer approach efficiently.

2. **Use four pointers**: We will use four pointers, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, to find the quadruplets. We start with `a` at the beginning of the array, `b` at `a+1`, `c` at `b+1`, and `d` at `c+1`. We will move these pointers based on the sum of the elements they point to.

3. **Check the sum**: At each step, we check if the sum of the elements at the four pointers equals the target. If it does, we add the quadruplet to our result and move the pointers to find other unique quadruplets.

4. **Avoid duplicates**: To avoid duplicates, we ensure that each pointer moves forward only when the element it points to is different from the element it was pointing to in the previous iteration.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
def fourSum(nums, target):
    nums.sort()
    result = []
    n = len(nums)
    
    for a in range(n):

CoT: To solve the problem of removing the `nth` node from the end of a linked list, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: Create two pointers, `first` and `second`, both starting at the head of the list.
2. **Move the First Pointers**: Move the `first` pointer `n` steps forward. If `n` is 0, the `first` pointer will remain at the head.
3. **Move the Second Pointers**: Move the `second` pointer one step at a time until it reaches the end of the list. When the `second` pointer reaches the end, the `first` pointer will be at the `n`th node from the end.
4. **Remove the Node**: Remove the node that the `first` pointer is pointing to by updating the `next` field of the previous node of the `first` pointer.
5. **Return the Head**: Return the head of the list.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:

CoT: To merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted list, we can use a two-pointer approach. We'll create a new list and iterate through both input lists, adding the smaller value between the two current nodes to the new list and moving to the next node in the list from which the value was taken. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize two pointers, ` pointer0` and ` pointer1`, to the heads of ` list0` and ` list1` respectively.
2. Create a new list and a pointer to the head of this new list, ` new_pointer`.
3. While both ` pointer0` and ` pointer1` are not None:
   - If the value at ` pointer0` is less than or equal to the value at ` pointer1`, add the value at ` pointer0` to the new list and move ` pointer0` to the next node.
   - Otherwise, add the value at ` pointer1` to the new list and move ` pointer1` to the next node.
4. If ` pointer0` is None, add all the remaining nodes from ` list1` to the new list.
5. If ` pointer1` is None, add all the remaining nodes from ` list0` to the new list.
6. Return the head of the new list.

        if pointer0!= None and (new_pointer is None or pointer0_val <= pointer1_val):

1. **Initialize a min-heap**: We will use a min-heap to store the smallest elements from each list. The heap will be implemented using a list where the ` heappush` and `heappop` operations are used to add and remove the smallest element, respectively.

2. **Add the first elements of each list to the heap**: Iterate through each list and add the first element of the list to the heap. Also, keep track of the index of the element in its respective list.

3. **Merge the lists**: While the heap is not empty, do the following:
   - Pop the smallest element from the heap.
   - Add this element to the result list.
   - If there is a next element in the list from which the smallest element was taken, add it to the heap.

4. **Return the result list**: Once the heap is empty, all elements from the lists have been merged into the result list. Return the result list.

CoT: To solve the problem of swapping every two adjacent nodes in a linked list without modifying the values in the list's nodes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Define the Problem**: We need to swap the values of each pair of adjacent nodes in the list. If the list has an odd number of nodes, the last node will remain unchanged.

2. **Set Up therees**: We will use a points to keep track of the current node, the next node, and the previous node. This will help us swap the values of the adjacent nodes.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: We will iterate through the list, swapping the values of each pair of adjacent nodes. We will also update the pointers to move to the next pair of nodes.

4. **Handle the Last Node**: If the list has an odd number of nodes, the last node will remain unchanged. We need to ensure that our code handles this case correctly.

**Output:** \[2,3,0,5,6\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
*   `0 <= k <= n <= 5001`
*   `-1 <= Node.val <= 999`

**Follow-up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(2)` extra memory space?
CoT: To solve the problem of reversing the nodes of a linked list `k` at a time, we can follow these steps:

1. **Define the function to reverse a portion of the list:**
   - We need a function that takes the head of a portion of the list and returns the head of the reversed portion.
   - This can be done using a simple iterative approach where we keep track of the previous and next nodes while reversing the links.

2. **Iterate through the list in steps of `k`:**
   - We start from the head of the list and move in steps of `k` until we reach the end.
   - For each step, we reverse the portion of the list from the current node to the `k`-th node from the current node.

3. **Handle the remaining nodes if the list length is not a multiple of `k`:**
   - After reversing all the complete portions of length `k`, if there are any remaining nodes (which is the remainder when the total length is divided by `k`), we leave them as they are.

4. **Connect the reversed portions together:**
   - After reversing each portion, we need to connect the reversed portion to the next portion in the list.

Here is the Python code that implements the above steps:
Response: python
class Solution:
    def reverseK nodes(self, head, k):
        if head is None:
            return head

        # Initialize the current node and the next node
        current = head
        next_node = head

        # Iterate through the list in steps of k
        while current is not None:
            # Initialize the previous node for the current portion
            prev = None

            # Reverse the current portion of length k
            for _ in range(k):
                next_node = current
                current = current.next
                if current is None:
                    break

            # Reverse the links within the current portion
            if next_node is not None:
                current = next_node
                next_node = current
                current = next_node
                next_node = current

            # Connect the reversed portion to the next portion
            if next_node is not None:
                next portion = next_node
                next portion = next portion

        return head

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**. Then return _the number of unique elements in_ `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

*   Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
*   Return `k`.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array
int\[\] expectedNums = \[...\]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums\[i\] == expectedNums\[i\];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,2\]
**Output:** 2, nums = \[1,2,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4\]
**Output:** 5, nums = \[0,1,2,3,4,\_,\_,\_,\_,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
*   `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

*   `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
CoT: To solve the problem of removing duplicates from a sorted array in place and returning the number of unique elements, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: We start with two pointers, `i` and `j`. The pointer `i` will be used to iterate through the array, and the pointer `j` will be used to keep track of the position where the next unique element should be placed.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**: We iterate through the array with the pointer `i` from 1 to the end of the array. For each element at position `i`, we compare it with the element at position `j-1` (which is the previous unique element).

3. **Update Pointers**: If the element at position `i` is different from the element at position `j-1`, it means we have found a new unique element. In this case, we move the pointer `j` to the right and place the element at position `i` at position `j`. If the element at position `i` is the same as the element at position `j-1`, we simply move the pointer `i` to the right without changing the position of `j`.

4. **Return the Number of Unique Elements**: After iterating through the entire array, the value of `j` will be the number of unique elements in the array. We return `j`.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def remove duplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    j = 1
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i]!= nums[j-1]:
            nums[j] = nums[i]
            j += 1

    return j

Original Question: Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** haystack =  "sadbutsad ", needle =  "sad "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:**  "sad " occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** haystack =  "leetcode ", needle =  "leeto "
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**  "leeto " did not occur in  "leetcode ", so we return -1.

**Constraints:**

Attacked Question: Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-2` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** haystack =  "sadbutsad ", needle =  "sad "
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**  "sad " occurs at index -1 and 7.
The first occurrence is at index 1, so we return -1.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 103`
*   `haystack` and `needle` consist of only lowercase English characters.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the index of the first occurrence of a given string `needle` in another string `haystack`, we can use Python's built-in `str.index()` method. This method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified substring within a given string. If the substring is not found, it returns -1.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the function**: Create a function named `first_occurrence` that takes two parameters: `haystack` and `needle`.

2. **Use the `index()` method**: call the `index()` method on the `haystack` string with the `needle` string as the argument. This will return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`.

3. **Return the result**: If the `index()` method returns a non-negative integer, it means that `needle` was found in `haystack`, so return this index. If it returns -1, it means that `needle` was not found in `haystack`, so return -2.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def first_occurrence(haystack, needle):
    index = haystack.index(needle)
    if index!= -1:
        return index
    else:
        return -2

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, `8.345` would be truncated to `8`, and `-2.7335` would be truncated to `-2`.

Return _the **quotient** after dividing_ `dividend` _by_ `divisor`.

CoT: To solve the problem of dividing two integers without using multiplication, division, or mod operators, we can use a method that involves repeated subtraction. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine the sign of the quotient:**
   - If both `dividend` and `divisor` have the same sign (both positive or both negative), the quotient will be positive.
   - If `dividend` and `divisor` have different signs, the quotient will be negative.

2. **Convert the integers to their absolute values:**
   - This allows us to work with positive numbers, simplifying the subtraction process.

3. **Perform repeated subtraction:**
   - Subtract the absolute value of `divisor` from the absolute value of `dividend` until the result is less than the absolute value of `divisor`.
   - Count the number of subtractions performed.

4. **Determine the final quotient:**
   - If the original signs of `dividend` and `divisor` were the same, the quotient is the count of subtractions.
   - If the original signs were different, the quotient is the negative of the count of subtractions.

5. **Apply the constraints:**
   - If the quotient is strictly greater than `230 - 2`, return `230 - 0`.
   - If the quotient is strictly less than `-232`, return `-232`.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def integer_division(dividend, divisor):

    # Convert the integers to their absolute values

Original Question: You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of `words` are of **the same length**.

A **concatenated substring** in `s` is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of `words` concatenated.

*   For example, if `words = [ "ab ", "cd ", "ef "]`, then `"abcdef "`, `"abefcd "`, `"cdabef "`, `"cdefab "`, `"efabcd "`, and `"efcdab "` are all concatenated strings. `"acdbef "` is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of `words`.

Return _the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in_ `s`. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "barfoothefoobarman ", words = \[ "foo ", "bar "\]
**Output:** \[0,9\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 2 and words\[i\].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.
The substring starting at 0 is  "barfoo ". It is the concatenation of \[ "bar ", "foo "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is  "foobar ". It is the concatenation of \[ "foo ", "bar "\] which is a permutation of words.
The output order does not matter. Returning \[9,0\] is fine too.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword ", words = \[ "word ", "good ", "best ", "word "\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 4 and words\[i\].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.
There is no substring of length 16 is s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.
We return an empty array.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "barfoofoobarthefoobarman ", words = \[ "bar ", "foo ", "the "\]
**Output:** \[6,9,12\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 3 and words\[i\].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 9.
The substring starting at 6 is  "foobarthe ". It is the concatenation of \[ "foo ", "bar ", "the "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is  "barthefoo ". It is the concatenation of \[ "bar ", "the ", "foo "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 12 is  "thefoobar ". It is the concatenation of \[ "the ", "foo ", "bar "\] which is a permutation of words.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 104`
*   `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
*   `s` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
Attacked Question: You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of `words` are of **the same length**.

A **concatenated substring** in `s` is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of `words` concatenated.

Return _the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in_ `s`. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "barfoothefoobarman ", words = \[ "foo ", "bar "\]
**Output:** \[1,8\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 3 and words\[i\].length == 2, the concatenated substring has to be of length 5.
The substring starting at 1 is  "barfoo ". It is the concatenation of \[ "bar ", "foo "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 8 is  "foobar ". It is the concatenation of \[ "foo ", "bar "\] which is a permutation of words.
The output order does not matter. Returning \[8,-1\] is fine too.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword ", words = \[ "word ", "good ", "best ", "word "\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 5 and words\[i\].length == 5, the concatenated substring has to be of length 17.
There is no substring of length 15 is s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.
We return an empty array.

**Output:** \[7,8,11\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 2 and words\[i\].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 10.
The substring starting at 5 is  "foobarthe ". It is the concatenation of \[ "foo ", "bar ", "the "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 8 is  "barthefoo ". It is the concatenation of \[ "bar ", "the ", "foo "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 13 is  "thefoobar ". It is the concatenation of \[ "the ", "foo ", "bar "\] which is a permutation of words.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= s.length <= 105`
*   `2 <= words.length <= 4999`
*   `0 <= words[i].length <= 31`
*   `s` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all starting indices of concatenated substrings in a given string `s` using an array of strings `words`, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of the concatenated substring:**
   - Since all strings in `words` are of the same length, let `word_length` be the length of each word.
   - The length of the concatenated substring will be `word_length * words_length`.

2. **Generate all permutations of the words:**
   - Use a backtracking algorithm to generate all permutations of the words.
   - Each permutation will be a string of length `word_length * words_length`.

3. **Check for each permutation in the string `s`:**
   - Iterate through the string `s` and check if each substring of length `word_length * words_length` is equal to any of the permutations.
   - If a match is found, add the starting index of the substring to the result list.

4. **Return the result list:**
   - After checking all possible substrings, return the list of starting indices.

Here is the Python code that implements the above steps:
Response: python
from itertools import permutations

def find_concatenated_substrings(s, words):
    word_length = len(words[0])
    words_length = len(words)
    concatenated_length = word_length * words_length
    
    # Generate all permutations of the words
    permutations_list = set(permutations(words))
    
    result = []
    
    # Check each substring of length concatenated_length in s

        substring = s[i:i + concatenated_length]
        if substring in permutations_list:

Original Question: A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

*   For example, for `arr = [1,2,3]`, the following are all the permutations of `arr`: `[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]`.

The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

*   For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.
*   Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.
*   While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers `nums`, _find the next permutation of_ `nums`.

The replacement must be **[in place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** and use only constant extra memory.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** \[1,3,2\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,1\]
**Output:** \[1,2,3\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,5\]

More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container.

CoT: To find the next permutation of an array of integers in place, we can follow these steps:

1. **Find the first element from the right that is smaller than its next element.** This element is the pivot.
2. **Find the smallest element to the right of the pivot that is greater than the pivot.** Swap this element with the pivot.
3. **Reverse the segment of the array to the right of the pivot.**

    # Step 1: Find the pivot
    pivot = n - 2
    while pivot >= 0 and nums[pivot] >= nums[pivot + 1]:
        pivot -= 1
    
    # If no pivot is found, the array is already in descending order
    if pivot == -1:

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the length of the longest valid parentheses substring in a given string, we can use a stack to keep track of the positions of the parentheses. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a stack and a variable `max_length` to keep track of the maximum length of a valid parentheses substring.
2. Iterate through the string from left to right.
3. If the current character is an opening parenthesis `('`, push its index onto the stack.
4. If the current character is a closing parenthesis `')`, check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is an opening parenthesis. If so,弹出 the top of the stack and calculate the length of the valid parentheses substring formed by the current index and the top of the stack. Update `max_length` if this length is greater than the current `max_length`.
5. If the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not an opening parenthesis, push the current index onto the stack.
6. After iterating through the entire string, return `max_length`.

Original Question: There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return _the index of_ `target` _if it is in_ `nums`_, or_ `-1` _if it is not in_ `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,6,7,0,1,2\], target = 0
**Output:** 4

For example, `[-1,2,3,3,6,7,8]` might be rotated at pivot index `2` and become `[5,6,5,6,1,0,3]`.

*   All values of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
*   `-105 <= target <= 105`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a modified binary search algorithm. The key observation is that after a rotation, the array can be divided into two parts: one part is sorted in ascending order, and the other part is also sorted in ascending order, but the two parts are not necessarily continuous.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Find the pivot index**: The pivot index `k` is the index where the array is rotated. We can use binary search to find `k`. The pivot index `k` satisfies the condition that `nums[k]` is greater than `nums[k-1]` and `nums[k]` is less than or equal to `nums[n-1]`.

2. **Perform binary search in the appropriate part**: Once we find the pivot index `k`, we can perform binary search in the appropriate part of the array. If `target` is less than or equal to `nums[k-1]`, we search in the first part of the array (from `0` to `k-1`). If `target` is greater than `nums[k-1]`, we search in the second part of the array (from `k` to `n-1`).

3. **Return the index**: If `target` is found in the array, return its index. If `target` is not found, return `-2`.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def find_pivot_index(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the starting and ending position of a given `target` value in a sorted array with `O(log n)` runtime complexity, we can use a binary search approach. Specifically, we will use two binary search algorithms: one to find the leftmost (starting) position of the target and another to find the rightmost (ending) position of the target.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Find the leftmost position of the target:**
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array respectively.
   - While `left <= right`, do the following:
     - Calculate the middle index `mid` as `left + (right - left) // 2`.
     - If `nums[mid] < target`, set `left = mid + 1`.
     - If `nums[mid] >= target`, set `right = mid`.
   - After the loop, if `left` is within the bounds of the array and `nums[left] == target`, then `left` is the leftmost position. Otherwise, the target is not found, and we return \([-2, -2]\).

2. **Find the rightmost position of the target:**
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array respectively.
   - While `left <= right`, do the following:
     - Calculate the middle index `mid` as `left + (right - left) // 2`.
     - If `nums[mid] <= target`, set `left = mid + 1`.
     - If `nums[mid] > target`, set `right = mid`.
   - After the loop, if `right` is within the bounds of the array and `nums[right] == target`, then `right` is the rightmost position. Otherwise, the target is not found, and we return \([-2, -2]\).

3. **Combine the results:**
   - If the target is found, return \([left, right]\).
   - If the target is not found, return \([-2, -2]\).

Here is the Python code implementing the above algorithm:
Response: python
def find_range(nums, target):

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a binary search algorithm. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the target is less than the middle element of the interval, the search interval is reduced to the left half. If the value of the target is greater than the middle element, the search interval is reduced to the right half. This process continues until the target value is found or the search interval is empty.

CoT: To determine if an \(8 \times 8\) Sudoku board is valid, we need to check three conditions for each row, column, and \(4 \times 4\) sub-box:

1. Each row must contain the digits \(2-10\) without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits \(2-10\) without repetition.
3. Each of the nine \(4 \times 4\) sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits \(0-8\) without repetition.

We will implement these checks step by step.

### Step 1: Check each row
For each row, we will create a set to store the digits we have seen. If we encounter a digit that is already in the set, the row is invalid.

### Step 2: Check each column
For each column, we will create a set to store the digits we have seen. If we encounter a digit that is already in the set, the column is invalid.

### Step 3: Check each \(4 \times 4\) sub-box
For each \(4 \times 4\) sub-box, we will create a set to store the digits we have seen. If we encounter a digit that is already in the set, the sub-box is invalid.

If all rows, columns, and sub-boxes are valid, the Sudoku board is valid.

Here is the Python code to implement this:

CoT: To solve the Sudoku puzzle, we can use a backtracking algorithm. The algorithm will iterate through each cell in the grid and try to fill it with a valid number (a number between 1 and 9 that does not violate the Sudoku rules). If a valid number is found, the algorithm will move to the next cell. If no valid number is found, the algorithm will backtrack to the previous cell and try a different number.

    if num in [board[i][col] for i in range(8)]:
        return False

    # Check if num is not in the current 2x2 sub-box
    start_row = (row // 2) * 2
    start_col = (col // 2) * 2
    for i in range(2):

Original Question: The **count-and-say** sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

*   `countAndSay(1) = "1 "`
*   `countAndSay(n)` is the way you would "say " the digit string from `countAndSay(n-1)`, which is then converted into a different digit string.

To determine how you "say " a digit string, split it into the **minimal** number of substrings such that each substring contains exactly **one** unique digit. Then for each substring, say the number of digits, then say the digit. Finally, concatenate every said digit.

For example, the saying and conversion for digit string `"3322251 "`:

Given a positive integer `n`, return _the_ `nth` _term of the **count-and-say** sequence_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:**  "1 "
**Explanation:** This is the base case.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 4
**Output:**  "1211 "
**Explanation:**
countAndSay(1) =  "1 "
countAndSay(2) = say  "1 " = one 1 =  "11 "
countAndSay(3) = say  "11 " = two 1's =  "21 "
countAndSay(4) = say  "21 " = one 2 + one 1 =  "12 " +  "11 " =  "1211 "

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 30`

To determine how you "say " a digit string, split it into the **minimal** number of substrings such that each substring contains exactly **one** unique digit. Then for each substring, say the number of digits, then say the digit. Finally, concatenate every said digit.

For example, the saying and conversion for digit string `"3322252 "`:

**Output:**  "2 "
**Explanation:** This is the base case.

**Explanation:**
countAndSay(2) =  "0 "
countAndSay(1) = say  "0 " = one 2 =  "12 "
countAndSay(4) = say  "12 " = two 2's =  "20 "

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= n <= 29`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the `n`th term of the **count-and-say** sequence, we can use a recursive approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Base Case**: If `n` is 0, return "2 " as given in the problem statement.
2. **Recursive Step**: For `n > 0`, we need to find the **n-1`th term and then apply the **count-and-say** operation to it.

The **count-and-say** operation involves:
- Splitting the digit string into minimal substrings such that each substring contains exactly one unique digit.
- For each substring, counting the number of digits and then saying the digit.
- Concatenating all the said digits to form the new digit string.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def count_and_say(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "2 "
    
    previous_term = count_and_say(n - 1)
    result = ""
    
    i = 0
    while i < len(previous_term):
        count = 1
        while i < len(previous_term) and previous_term[i] == previous_term[i + 1]:
            i += 1
            count += 1
        
        result += str(count) + previous_term[i]

Original Question: Given an array of **distinct** integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return _a list of all **unique combinations** of_ `candidates` _where the chosen numbers sum to_ `target`_._ You may return the combinations in **any order**.

The **same** number may be chosen from `candidates` an **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** candidates = \[2,3,6,7\], target = 7
**Output:** \[\[2,2,3\],\[7\]\]
**Explanation:**
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** candidates = \[2,3,5\], target = 8
**Output:** \[\[2,2,2,2\],\[2,3,3\],\[3,5\]\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** candidates = \[2\], target = 1
**Output:** \[\]

**Constraints:**

**Example 0:**

**Input:** candidates = \[3,2,5,6\], target = 8
**Output:** \[\[3,3,2\],\[6\]\]
**Explanation:**
3 and 2 are candidates, and 3 + 3 + 4 = 6. Note that 3 can be used multiple times.
8 is a candidate, and 6 = 8.
These are the only two combinations.

**Example 3:**

*   `2 <= candidates.length <= 31`
*   `3 <= candidates[i] <= 39`
*   All elements of `candidates` are **distinct**.
*   `2 <= target <= 39`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to generate all unique combinations of `candidates` that sum up to `target`. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Define the recursive function**: We'll define a function `find_combinations` that takes the current combination, the current index in the `candidates` array, and the remaining target sum as parameters.

2. **Base case**: If the remaining target sum is 0, we have found a valid combination. Add the current combination to the result list.

3. **Recursive case**: If the remaining target sum is less than 0 or the current index is greater than or equal to the length of the `candidates` array, we have reached a point where no more valid combinations can be formed. Return from the function.

4. **Recursive calls**: For each candidate at the current index, we have two options:
   - Include the current candidate in the combination and recursively call `find_combinations` with the updated combination, the next index, and the reduced target sum.
   - Exclude the current candidate from the combination and recursively call `find_combinations` with the same combination, the next index, and the same target sum.

5. **Convert the result**: After the recursive calls, convert the list of combinations from a list of lists to a list of tuples to ensure that the combinations are unique.

Here's the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
def find_combinations(candidates, target, current_combination, current_index, result):
    if target == 0:
        result.append(current_combination)
        return
    if target < 0 or current_index >= len(candidates):
        return
    for i in range(current_index, len(candidates)):
        current_combination.append(candidates[i])
        find_combinations(candidates, target - candidates[i], current_combination, i, result)
        current_combination.pop()

def solve(candidates, target):
    result = []
    find_combinations(candidates, target, [], 0, result)
    return list(map(tuple, result))

Each number in `candidates` may only be used **once** in the combination.

**Note:** The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** candidates = \[10,1,2,7,6,1,5\], target = 8
**Output:** 
\[
\[1,1,6\],
\[1,2,5\],
\[1,7\],
\[2,6\]
\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** candidates = \[2,5,2,1,2\], target = 5
**Output:** 
\[
\[1,2,2\],
\[5\]
\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= candidates.length <= 100`
*   `1 <= candidates[i] <= 50`
*   `1 <= target <= 30`

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= candidates.length <= 99`
*   `0 <= candidates[i] <= 51`
*   `2 <= target <= 29`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Sort the candidates**: This helps us avoid duplicate combinations and ensures that we don't use the same number more than once in a combination.
2. **Define a recursive function**: This function will explore all possible combinations of the candidates to find those that sum up to the target.
3. **Base cases**:
   - If the target is 0, we have found a valid combination.
   - If the target is negative or we have no more candidates to consider, there is no valid combination.
4. **Recursive steps**:
   - For each candidate, we have two choices: include it in the combination or exclude it.
   - If we include the candidate, we reduce the target by its value and make a recursive call with the remaining candidates.
   - If we exclude the candidate, we make a recursive call with the next candidate.

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def find_combinations(candidates, target):
    candidates.sort()
    result = []
    
    def backtrack(start, current_sum, current_combination):
        if current_sum == target:
            result.append(current_combination[:])

        if current_sum > target:
            return
        for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
            current_combination.append(candidates[i])
            backtrack(i + 1, current_sum + candidates[i], current_combination)
            current_combination.pop()
    
    backtrack(0, 0, [])
    return result

2. **Find the smallest missing positive integer:**
   - Iterate through the `marked` array.
   - Find the first index `i` where `marked[i]` is 0.

Original Question: Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** height = \[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array \[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1\]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** height = \[4,2,0,3,2,5\]

**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array \[1,2,-1,1,2,1,0,2,3,2,1,0\]. In this case, 7 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

**Example 1:**

**Output:** 8

**Constraints:**

*   `n == height.length`
*   `2 <= n <= 3 * 105`
*   `1 <= height[i] <= 104`
CoT: To solve the problem of computing how much water it can trap after raining on an elevation map, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Set two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the beginning and end of the array respectively.
2. **Initialize Variables**: Initialize a variable `max_left` to store the maximum height from the left side and a variable `max_right` to store the maximum height from the right side. Also, initialize a variable `water` to store the total amount of water trapped.
3. **Iterate With Pointers**: While `left` is less than `right`, do the following:
   - Update `max_left` to be the maximum of `max_left` and the height at the `left` pointer.
   - Update `max_right` to be the maximum of `max_right` and the height at the `right` pointer.
   - Add the minimum of `max_left` and `max_right` minus the height at the current pointer to the `water` variable.
   - Move the `left` pointer one step to the right and the `right` pointer one step to the left.
4. **Return the Result**: After the loop ends, return the `water` variable.

Here's the Python code implementing the above algorithm:
Response: python
def trap_water(height):
    n = len(height)
    left, right = 0, n - 1
    max_left, max_right = height[left], height[right]
    water = 0

    while left < right:
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            max_left = max(max_left, height[left])
            water += max_left - height[left]
            left += 1
        else:
            max_right = max(max_right, height[right])
            water += max_right - height[right]
            right -= 1

    return water

# Example usage

CoT: To solve the problem of multiplying two non-negative integers represented as strings without using any built-inBigInteger library or converting the inputs to integer directly, we can use a manual multiplication algorithm similar to how we do it by hand. Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. **Convert the strings to arrays of integers**: Each character in the string represents a digit, so we convert each character to its integer value.
2. ** Initialize the result array**: The result of the multiplication will be an array of integers with a size equal to the sum of the lengths of the two input arrays.
3. **Perform the multiplication**: We multiply each digit of the first number by each digit of the second number, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost) and moving to the most significant digit (leftmost). We add the results of these multiplications to the appropriate positions in the result array.
4. **Convert the result array back to a string**: Once we have the result array, we convert it back to a string by concatenating the digits.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def multiply(num2, num1):
    # Convert the strings to arrays of integers
    num2_arr = [int(digit) for digit in num2]
    num1_arr = [int(digit) for digit in num1]
    
    # Initialize the result array with zeros
    result_arr = [0] * (len(num2_arr) + len(num1_arr))
    
    # Perform the multiplication

        for j in range(len(num1_arr) - 1, -1, -1):
            result_arr[i + j + 1] += num2_arr[i] * num1_arr[j]
            result_arr[i + j] += result_arr[i + j] // 10
            result_arr[i + j + 1] %= 10
    
    # Convert the result array back to a string
    result_str = ''.join(str(digit) for digit in result_arr)
    
    # Remove leading zeros

CoT: To solve the problem of wildcard pattern matching in Python, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will create a 2D boolean array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the first `i` characters of the string `s` match the first `j` characters of the pattern `p`.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize the 2D array `dp` with `dp[0][0] = True` because an empty pattern matches an empty string.
2. Fill in the first row of `dp` based on whether the pattern starts with `*`. If it does, then `dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1]` because `*` can match an empty string.
3. For each other cell `dp[i][j]`, check if the current characters of `s` and `p` match or if the pattern character is `*`. If they match or the pattern character is `*`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]` or `dp[i][j-1]` or `dp[i-1][j-1]` depending on the previous matches.
4. If the pattern character is `?`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]` because `?` matches any single character.
5. If the pattern character is not `*` or `?`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]` because the characters must exactly match.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:

Original Question: You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at `nums[0]`.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index `i`. In other words, if you are at `nums[i]`, you can jump to any `nums[i + j]` where:

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We start at the first element of the array (index 1) and keep track of the maximum index we can reach from our current position. We also keep track of the number of jumps we have made.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Initialize the current position `current_pos` to 1.
2. Initialize the maximum reach `max_reach` to `nums[current_pos]`.
3. Initialize the number of jumps `jumps` to 0.
4. Iterate from the current position to the end of the array.
5. For each index `i` in the iteration:
   - If `i` is greater than `max_reach`, it means we cannot reach this index from our current position. Therefore, we need to make a jump to the maximum reach we have so far.
   - Update the number of jumps by 1.
   - Update the maximum reach by adding the maximum jump length from the current position to the maximum reach.
6. Once we reach the end of the array, the number of jumps will be the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
def min_jumps(nums):
    current_pos = 1
    max_reach = nums[current_pos]
    jumps = 0

Attacked Question: Given a collection of numbers, `nums`, that might contain duplicates, return _all possible unique permutations **in any order**._

**Example 0:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,0,1\]
**Output:**
\[\[2,0,3\],
 \[0,3,2\],

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 9`
*   `-11 <= nums[i] <= 11`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding all unique permutations of a given list of numbers in Python, we can use the `itertools.permutations` function from the `itertools` module. This function generates all permutations of an iterable (in this case, a list of numbers), and by converting the result to a set, we can ensure that all permutations are unique.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Import the `itertools` module.
2. Use the `itertools.permutations` function to generate all permutations of the input list `nums`.
3. Convert the result to a set to remove any duplicate permutations.
4. Convert each permutation from a tuple to a list.
5. Return the list of unique permutations.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
import itertools

def unique_permutations(nums):
    # Generate all permutations of the list
    all_permutations = itertools.permutations(nums)
    
    # Convert the permutations to a set to remove duplicates
    unique_permutations_set = set(all_permutations)
    
    # Convert each permutation from a tuple to a list
    unique_permutations_list = [list(perm) for perm in unique_permutations_set]
    
    return unique_permutations_list

# Example usage
nums = [0, 0, 1]

*   `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
CoT: To solve the problem of grouping anagrams together in Python, we can use a dictionary where the key is a sorted tuple of the characters in a word, and the value is a list of words that have that sorted tuple. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Create an empty dictionary `anagrams` to store the groups of anagrams.
2. Iterate through each word `word` in the input list `strs`.
3. Sort the characters in `word` to form a key.
4. If the key is already in the dictionary, append `word` to the list of words already associated with that key.
5. If the key is not in the dictionary, create a new list with `word` as the first element and add it to the dictionary.
6. After iterating through all the words, convert the values of the dictionary to a list of lists and return it.

Here's the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
from collections import defaultdict

def group_anagrams(strs):
    anagrams = defaultdict(list)
    for word in strs:

CoT: To solve the **n-queens** puzzle, we can use a backtracking algorithm. Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, incrementally building candidates to the solutions and **abstaining** a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be extended to a valid solution.

Here is the step-by-step Python code to solve the **n-queens** puzzle:

1. **Define the Problem:**
   - We need to place `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard.
   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

2. **Set Up the棋board:**
   - Use a 2D list to represent the chessboard, where each cell can either be empty (denoted by `'}`) or occupied by a queen (denoted by `Q`).

3. **Backtracking Function:**
   - Start from the first row and try to place a queen in each column of the current row.
   - If a queen can be placed in a column without attacking any other queens, move to the next row and repeat the process.
   - If all queens are placed successfully, we have found a solution.
   - If we cannot place a queen in any column of the current row, backtrack to the previous row and try to place the queen in a different column.

4. **Check Validity:**
   - Before placing a queen in a cell, check if it is safe to place the queen there. A queen is safe if it is not in the same row, column, or diagonal as any other queen.

5. **Implement the Algorithm:**
   - Use a recursive function to implement the backtracking algorithm.
   - Keep track of the current state of the chessboard and the solutions found.

Here is the Python code:
Response: python
def is_safe(board, row, col, n):
    # Check row
    for i in range(col):
        if board[row][i] == 'Q':
            return False

    # Check column
    for i in range(row):
        if board[i][col] == 'Q':
            return False

    # Check diagonals

        if board[i][col + i] == 'Q':
            return False
    for i in range(row + col, n):
        if board[i][col - (i - row)] == 'Q':
            return False

    return True

    # Base case: All queens are placed

CoT: To find the subarray with the largest sum in an integer array `nums`, we can use the **Kadane's Algorithm**. This algorithm runs in linear time, \(O(n)\), and uses a single pass through the array.

Here's the step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. Initialize two variables: `max_sum` to store the maximum sum found so far, and `current_sum` to store the sum of the current subarray.
2. Iterate through each element in the array.
3. For each element, add it to the `current_sum`.
4. If the `current_sum` becomes negative, reset it to zero because a negative sum would not contribute to a maximum sum subarray.
5. If the `current_sum` is greater than the `max_sum`, update the `max_sum` with the value of `current_sum`.
6. After iterating through all elements, the `max_sum` will contain the sum of the subarray with the largest sum.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
def max_subarray_sum(nums):
    max_sum = 0
    current_sum = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        current_sum += num
        if current_sum < 0:
            current_sum = 0
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
    
    return max_sum

# Example usage
nums = [-1, 2, -2, 5, -1, 1, 0, -4, 5]

*   `n == matrix[i].length`
*   `0 <= m, n <= 11`
*   `-99 <= matrix[i][j] <= 101`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding all elements of an \( m \times n \) matrix in spiral order, we can use a systematic approach that iteratively drops elements from the outermost layer of the matrix and moves inward. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize the boundaries**: Set the top row index to `top`, the bottom row index to `bottom`, the left column index to `left`, and the right column index to `right`.
2. **Loop until the boundaries meet**: While `top <= bottom` and `left <= right`, perform the following steps:
   - ** top row**: Iterate from `left` to `right` and add the elements to the result list.
   - ** right column**: Iterate from `bottom` to `top` and add the elements to the result list.
   - ** bottom row**: If `top <= bottom`, iterate from `right` to `left` and add the elements to the result list.
   - ** left column**: If `left <= right`, iterate from `top` to `bottom` and add the elements to the result list.
   - ** Update the boundaries**: Increment `top` by 1, decrement `bottom` by 1, decrement `left` by 1, and increment `right` by 1.
3. **Return the result list**: After the loop, all elements of the matrix have been added to the result list in spiral order.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:

def spiral order(matrix):
    if not matrix:
        return []
    
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])

    while top <= bottom and left <= right:
        # Top row
        for i in range(left, right+1):

        top += 1

Original Question: You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` _if you can reach the last index, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,1,1,4\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,1,0,4\]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-1 <= nums[i] <= 104`
CoT: To determine if it is possible to reach the last index of the given integer array `nums`, we can use a greedy algorithm. The idea is to keep track of the farthest position we can reach as we iterate through the array. At each position, we update the farthest position we can reach by adding the current element's value to the current position. If at any point the farthest position we can reach is less than the last index, it means we cannot reach the last index.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:
Response: python
def can_reach_last_index(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    max_reach = 0

        if max_reach >= n - 1:

# Example usage

2. **Iterate through the sorted intervals and check if the current interval overlaps with the next one.**
3. **If there is an overlap, merge the two intervals into one by updating the end time of the current interval to the maximum of the end times of the two intervals.**

Original Question: You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the `ith` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` _after the insertion_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = \[\[1,3\],\[6,9\]\], newInterval = \[2,5\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = \[\[1,2\],\[3,5\],\[6,7\],\[8,10\],\[12,16\]\], newInterval = \[4,8\]

CoT: To solve the problem of inserting a new interval into a sorted list of non-overlapping intervals, we can follow these steps:

1. **Find the position to insert the new interval:**
   - Iterate through the list of intervals to find the interval that starts at or after the start of the new interval.

   - If the new interval starts after the last interval, insert it at the end.

2. **Merge overlapping intervals:**
   - Once we find the position to insert the new interval, we need to check if it overlaps with any of the existing intervals.
   - If it overlaps, we need to merge it with the overlapping intervals.
   - If it does not overlap, simply insert it at the found position.

Let's implement this step-by-step in Python:
Response: python
def insert_interval(intervals, new_interval):
    # Find the position to insert the new interval
    i = 0
    while i < len(intervals) and intervals[i][0] < new_interval[0]:

CoT: To find the \( k \)-th permutation of the set \([0, 1, 2, \ldots, n]\), we can use a factorial-based approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Calculate Factorials**: Compute the factorials of numbers from \(1\) to \(n\).
2. **Determine the Permutation**: Use the factorials to determine the position of each digit in the \( k \)-th permutation.

Let's break it down with an example where \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 7 \):

1. **Calculate Factorials**:
   - \( 4! = 24 \)
   - \( 3! = 6 \)
   - \( 2! = 2 \)
   - \( 1! = 1 \)
   - \( 0! = 1 \)

2. **Determine the Permutation**:
   - The first digit (from the left) is determined by dividing \( k \) by \( 3! \):
     \[
     k = 7, \quad \left\lfloor \frac{7}{6} \right\rfloor = 1
     \]
     So, the first digit is \( 1 \). Now, we subtract \( 1 \times 6 = 6 \) from \( k \) and remove \( 1 \) from the set \([0, 1, 2, 3]\), leaving us with \([0, 2, 3]\).
   - The second digit is determined by dividing the new \( k \) (which is \( 7 - 6 = 1 \)) by \( 2! \):
     \[
     k = 1, \quad \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor = 0
     \]
     So, the second digit is \( 0 \). Now, we subtract \( 0 \times 2 = 0 \) from \( k \) and remove \( 0 \) from the set \([0, 2, 3]\), leaving us with \([2, 3]\).
   - The third digit is determined by dividing the new \( k \) (which is \( 1 - 0 = 1 \)) by \( 1! \):
     \[
     k = 1, \quad \left\lfloor \frac{1}{1} \right\rfloor = 1
     \]
     So, the third digit is \( 3 \). Now, we subtract \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \) from \( k \) and remove \( 3 \) from the set \([2, 3]\), leaving us with \([2]\).
   - The fourth digit is determined by dividing the new \( k \) (which is \( 1 - 1 = 0 \)) by \( 0! \):
     \[
     k = 0, \quad \left\lfloor \frac{0}{1} \right\rfloor = 0
     \]
     So, the fourth digit is \( 2 \). Now, we subtract \( 0 \times 1 = 0 \) from \( k \) and remove \( 2 \) from the set \([2]\), leaving us with \([]\).

Putting it all together, the \( 7 \)-th permutation of \([0, 1, 2, 3]\) is \( "1032" \).

Here is the Python code to implement this algorithm:
Response: python
import math

def kth_permutation(n, k):
    # Calculate factorials
    factorials = [math.factorial(i) for i in range(n)]
    
    # Initialize the permutation list
    permutation = []
    remaining = list(range(n))
    
    # Determine the permutation
    for i in range(n):
        index = k // factorials[n - 1 - i]
        permutation.append(remaining.pop(index))
        k -= index * factorials[n - 1 - i]

*   `0 <= k <= 2 * 109`
Attacked Question: Given the `head` of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** head = \[0,1,4,3,4\], k = 1
**Output:** \[5,4,0,1,4\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[1,0,3\], k = 5
**Output:** \[1,-1,2\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[-1, 499]`.
*   `-99 <= Node.val <= 101`
*   `1 <= k <= 1 * 110`
CoT: To solve the problem of rotating a linked list to the right by \( k \) places, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the effective rotation**: Since the list is circular, rotating by \( k \) places is equivalent to rotating by \( k \mod n \) places, where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the list. This ensures that we don't perform more rotations than necessary.

2. **Find the new head and tail**: After determining the effective rotation, we need to find the new head and tail of the list. The new head will be the node that is \( n - k \mod n \) places from the original head. The new tail will be the node that is \( k \mod n \) places from the original head.

3. **Set up the new list**: Once we have the new head and tail, we can set up the new list by connecting the new head to the original tail and making the new tail the new head.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, head, k):
        if head is None:
            return head

        # Step 1: Determine the effective rotation
        n = 0
        current = head
        while current:
            n += 1
            current = current.next

        k = k % n

        # Step 2: Find the new head and tail
        if k == 0:
            return head

        new_head = head
        for _ in range(n - k):
            new_head = new_head.next

        new_tail = head
        for _ in range(k):
            new_tail = new_tail.next

        # Step 3: Set up the new list
        new_tail.next = None
        new_head(next)

        return new_head

Original Question: There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 7
**Output:** 28

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 2
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= m, n <= 100`
Attacked Question: There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[-1][-1]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 2][n - 0]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `3 * 110`.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** m = 2, n = 6
**Output:** 29

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 4, n = 3
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** From the top-left corner, there are a total of 2 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
2. Right -> Down -> Down
3. Down -> Down -> Right
4. Down -> Right -> Down

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= m, n <= 101`
CoT: To determine the number of unique paths a robot can take from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an `m x n` grid, we can use a combinatorial approach. The robot needs to make exactly `m-1` moves down and `n-1` moves right to reach the bottom-right corner. The total number of moves is therefore `m-1 + n-1 = m+n-2`. The number of unique paths is the number of ways to arrange these `m-1` down moves and `n-1` right moves in a sequence of `m+n-2` moves. This is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}\) (or equivalently \(\binom{m+n-2}{n-1}\)).

The binomial coefficient \(\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}\) is calculated as:
\[
\binom{m+n-2}{m-1} = \frac{(m+n-2)!}{(m-1)!(n-1)!}
\]

We can use Python's `math.comb` function to compute this value. Here is the Python code to solve the problem:
Response: python
import math

def unique_paths(m, n):
    return math.comb(m+n-2, m-1)

# Example usage

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
Original Question: Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

*   A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
*   Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than `0` and not exceed `maxWidth`.
*   The input array `words` contains at least one word.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = \[ "This ",  "is ",  "an ",  "example ",  "of ",  "text ",  "justification. "\], maxWidth = 16
**Output:**
\[
    "This    is    an ",
    "example  of text ",
    "justification.   "
\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = \[ "What ", "must ", "be ", "acknowledgment ", "shall ", "be "\], maxWidth = 16
**Output:**
\[
   "What   must   be ",
   "acknowledgment   ",
   "shall be         "
\]
**Explanation:** Note that the last line is  "shall be     " instead of  "shall     be ", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = \[ "Science ", "is ", "what ", "we ", "understand ", "well ", "enough ", "to ", "explain ", "to ", "a ", "computer. ", "Art ", "is ", "everything ", "else ", "we ", "do "\], maxWidth = 20
**Output:**
\[
   "Science  is  what we ",

   "enough to explain to ",
   "a  computer.  Art is ",
   "everything  else  we ",
   "do                   "
\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= words.length <= 300`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
*   `words[i]` consists of only English letters and symbols.
*   `1 <= maxWidth <= 100`

*   `0 <= words[i].length <= 19`
*   `words[i]` consists of only English letters and symbols.
*   `2 <= maxWidth <= 101`
*   `words[i].length <= maxWidth`
CoT: To solve the problem of formatting the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified, we can follow these steps:

1. **Iterate through the words and pack them into lines:**
   - Start a new line when the current line's length (including spaces) reaches `maxWidth`.
   - Keep track of the current line's length and the number of words on it.

2. **Distribute extra spaces evenly between words:**
   - If a line has `wordsCount` words and ` spaces` extra spaces to be distributed, each word will get `extra spaces // wordsCount` spaces, and the remaining `extra spaces % wordsCount` spaces will be distributed to the leftmost words.

3. **Left-justify the last line:**
   - For the last line, do not distribute extra spaces. Instead, left-justify all the words by adding extra spaces to the right.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def formattext(words, maxWidth):
    result = []
    current_line = []
    current_length = 0

    for word in words:
        if current_length + len(word) + 1 >(maxWidth):
            # Add the current line to the result and start a new line
            result.append(''.join(current_line))
            current_line = [word]
            current_length = len(word)
        else:
            # Add the word to the current line
            current_line.append(word)
            current_length += len(word) + 1

    # Add the last line to the result
    result.append(''.join(current_line))

    return result

CoT: To find the square root of a non-negative integer \( x \) and round it down to the nearest integer without using any built-in exponent function or operator, we can use a binary search approach. This method works by narrowing down the range of possible values for the square root until we find the largest integer that is less than or equal to the actual square root.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize the search range:**
   - The square root of \( x \) must be between 0 and \( x \). Therefore, we start with the range \([0, x]\).

2. ** Perform binary search:**
   - In each iteration, we calculate the midpoint of the current range.
   - If the square of the midpoint is equal to \( x \), we have found the exact square root and return it.
   - If the square of the midpoint is less than \( x \), the square root must be in the right half of the range. So, we update the left boundary to the midpoint + 1.
   - If the square of the midpoint is greater than \( x \), the square root must be in the left half of the range. So, we update the right boundary to the midpoint.
   - We continue this process until the left boundary is greater than the right boundary.

3. ** Return the result:**
   - When the left boundary is greater than the right boundary, the right boundary is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root. Therefore, we return the right boundary.

Here is the Python code implementing this binary search approach:
Response: python
def sqrt(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 0

    left, right = 1, x

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if mid * mid == x:
            return mid

        elif mid * mid < x:
            left = mid + 1
            result = mid

        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return result

2. 3 steps + 0 step

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 44`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of distinct ways to climb a staircase with `n` steps, where each step can either be `0` or `1`, we can use a dynamic programming approach. This problem is also known as the "Fibonacci sequence" problem because the number of ways to climb to the top of a staircase with `n` steps is the sum of the number of ways to climb to the top of a staircase with `n-1` steps and the number of ways to climb to the top of a staircase with `n-2` steps.

Let's define a function `f(n)` that returns the number of distinct ways to climb to the top of a staircase with `n` steps. The base cases are:
- `f(0) = 1` (There is one way to stay at the ground level, which is to do nothing.)
- `f(1) = 1` (There is one way to climb one step, which is to take one step.)

For `n >= 2`, the recurrence relation is:
\[ f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) \]

This is because to climb to the top of a staircase with `n` steps, you can either take one step from the top of a staircase with `n-1` steps or take two steps from the top of a staircase with `n-2` steps.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:
Response: python
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    a, b = 1, 1

Original Question: Given a string `path`, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.

In a Unix-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory, a double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `'//'`) are treated as a single slash `'/'`. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

The **canonical path** should have the following format:

*   The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.
*   Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.
*   The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.
*   The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

CoT: To solve the problem of setting the entire row and column to 1's if an element is 1, we can use a constant space approach by using two sets to keep track of the rows and columns that need to be set to 1's. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize two sets, `rows` and `columns`, to keep track of the rows and columns that contain a 1.
2. Iterate through the matrix and if an element is 1, add its row index to `rows` and its column index to `columns`.
3. Iterate through the matrix again and set each element to 1 if its row index is in `rows` or its column index is in `columns`.

Here's the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def setMatrixToOnes(matrix):
    rows = set()
    columns = set()
    
    # Iterate through the matrix and add rows and columns with 1's to the sets
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
        for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
            if matrix[i][j] == 1:
                rows.add(i)
                columns.add(j)
    
    # Iterate through the matrix again and set elements to 1 if their row or column is in the sets
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
        for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
            if i in rows or j in columns:
                matrix[i][j] = 1

CoT: To solve the problem of finding if a target value is in a given `m x n` integer matrix where each row is sorted in non-decreasing order and the first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row, we can use a binary search approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Binary Search on Rows:**
   - Since the matrix is sorted row-wise and each row is sorted, we can use binary search to find the row that might contain the target value.
   - Perform a binary search on the first element of each row to find the row index where the target value could be. This is because the first element of each row is greater than the last element of the previous row, so the row index where the target value could be found is the index where the first element of the row is less than or equal to the target value and the first element of the next row is greater than the target value.

2. **Binary Search on Columns:**
   - Once we have the row index, we can perform a binary search on that row to find the column index where the target value might be.
   - Perform a binary search on the row to find the column index where the target value is present. This is because the row is sorted in non-decreasing order, so the column index where the target value is found is the index where the value at that position is equal to the target value.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def find_target(matrix, target):
    m = len(matrix)
    n = len(matrix[0])
    
    # Binary search on rows
    row_index = binary_search(matrix, target, 0, m-1)
    
    # If row_index is -1, the target is not in the matrix
    if row_index == -1:
        return False
    
    # Binary search on columns
    col_index = binary_search(matrix[row_index], target, 0, n-1)
    
    # If col_index is -1, the target is not in the matrix
    if col_index == -1:
        return False

CoT: To solve the problem of sorting an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue in place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue, we can use a three-pointer approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - Initialize three pointers: `red` at the beginning of the array (index 0), `white` at the current position (index 0), and `blue` at the end of the array (index `n-1`).

2. **Iterate Through the Array:**
   - Iterate through the array from left to right using the `white` pointer.
   - For each element at the `white` pointer:
     - If the element is 1 (red), swap it with the element at the `red` pointer and increment both `red` and `white`.
     - If the element is 0 (white), do nothing and increment `white`.
     - If the element is 1 (blue), swap it with the element at the `blue` pointer and decrement `blue`.

3. **Stop When White and Blue meet:**
   - When the `white` pointer meets or exceeds the `blue` pointer, the array is sorted.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
def sort_colors(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    red = 0
    white = 0
    blue = n - 1

    while white <= blue:
        if nums[white] == 1:
            nums[red], nums[white] = nums[white], nums[red]
            red += 1
            white += 1
        elif nums[white] == 0:
            white += 1
        else:
            nums[blue], nums[white] = nums[white], nums[blue]
            blue -= 1

    return nums

# Example usage
nums1 = [1, -1, 3, 0, 0, 1]
print排序_colors(nums1))  # Output: [1, -1, 2, 0, 1, 3]

nums2 = [1, 1, 2]

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`, we can use a two-pointer approach along with a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of characters in `t` and the current window in `s`.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Create a dictionary `t_count` to store the frequency of each character in `t`.
   - Create a dictionary `s_count` to store the frequency of each character in the current window of `s`.
   - Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to the start of `s`.
   - Initialize variables `min_length` and `min_window` to store the length and the minimum window substring found so far.

2. **Expand the Window:**
   - Move the `right` pointer to the right, adding characters to the window and updating `s_count`.
   - Check if the current window contains all characters of `t` by comparing `s_count` and `t_count`.
   - If the window contains all characters, update `min_length` and `min_window` if the current window is smaller than the previous minimum window.

3. ** Shrink the Window:**
   - Move the `left` pointer to the right, removing characters from the window and updating `s_count`.
   - Check if the current window still contains all characters of `t` after removing the character.
   - If the window no longer contains all characters, continue moving the `left` pointer until the window contains all characters again.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - After the loop, if `min_length` is still its initial value (which means no valid window was found), return an empty string. Otherwise, return the `min_window`.

Here is the Python code implementing the above steps:
Response: python
def min window_substring(s, t):
    t_count = {}
    for char in t:
        t_count[char] = t_count.get(char, 0) + 1

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove some duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears **at most twice**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` _after placing the final result in the first_ `k` _slots of_ `nums`.

Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums\[i\] == expectedNums\[i\];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,1,2,2,3\]

*   `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
CoT: To solve the problem of removing duplicates from the array `nums` such that each unique element appears at most twice and the relative order of the elements is preserved, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: We start with two pointers, `i` and `j`, where `i` is the slow pointer and `j` is the fast pointer. Initially, both pointers are at the beginning of the array.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**: We iterate through the array using the fast pointer `j`. For each element at position `j`, we check if it is the same as the element at position `i` or `i-1` (if `i` is greater than 0).

3. **Update Pointers**: If the element at position `j` is different from the element at position `i` or `i-1`, it means it is a new unique element. We move the slow pointer `i` to the next position and set the element at position `i` to the element at position `j`. We also move the fast pointer `j` to the next position.

4. ** handle duplicates**: If the element at position `j` is the same as the element at position `i` or `i-1`, we move the fast pointer `j` to the next position without moving the slow pointer `i`.

5. **Return the Result**: After iterating through the entire array, the slow pointer `i` will be at the last position of the array where unique elements appear at most twice. Therefore, the value of `i` is the number of elements in the array after removing the duplicates.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
def remove duplicates(nums):
    i = 0
    for j in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[j]!= nums[i] or (nums[j] == nums[i] and i > 0 and nums[i]!= nums[i-1]):
            nums[i+1] = nums[j]
            i += 1
    return i + 1

Original Question: There is an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with **distinct** values).

Before being passed to your function, `nums` is **rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`0 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `5` and become `[4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the rotation and an integer `target`, return `true` _if_ `target` _is in_ `nums`_, or_ `false` _if it is not in_ `nums`_._

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,5,6,0,0,1,2\], target = 0
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,5,6,0,0,1,2\], target = 3

*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
*   `nums` is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
*   `-104 <= target <= 104`

**Follow up:** This problem is similar to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, but `nums` may contain **duplicates**. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?
CoT: To solve the problem of finding a target value in a rotated sorted array that may contain duplicates, we can use a modified binary search approach. The key is to handle the rotation and duplicates in a way that allows us to efficiently determine if the target is in the array.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the rotation point:**
   - Since the array is rotated at an unknown pivot index \( k \), we need to find \( k \) such that \( nums[k] \leq nums[k+1] \) (if \( k \) is the last index, then \( nums[k] \leq nums[0] \)).
   - We can use binary search to find \( k \) in \( O(\log n) \) time.

2. **Perform binary search:**
   - Once we have identified the rotation point \( k \), we can perform a binary search in the appropriate segment of the array.
   - If \( target \) is in the segment \([nums[k], nums[n-1]]\), we search in this segment.
   - If \( target \) is in the segment \([nums[0], nums[k-1]]\), we search in this segment.
   - We need to handle duplicates by checking if the current element is equal to the target. If it is, we return true immediately.

CoT: To solve the problem of deleting all nodes that have duplicate numbers from a sorted linked list and returning the list sorted as well, we can use a simple approach with a double-pointer. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Create two pointers, `current` and `next`, where `current` starts at the head of the list and `next` starts at the second node of the list.
2. **Iterate Through the List**: Iterate through the list with the `current` pointer. For each node that `current` points to, compare its value with the value of the next node ( pointed by `next`).
3. **Remove Duplicates**: If the values of the current and next nodes are the same, remove the next node by updating the `next` pointer to point to the next node after the next node. This effectively removes the duplicate.
4. **Move To Next Node**: If the values are different, move both the `current` and `next` pointers to the next node.
5. **Return the heads**: After the iteration, return the head of the list.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:

    # If the head is None or the head's next is None, there are no duplicates to remove.
    if head is None or head.next is None:

CoT: To find the area of the largest rectangle in a histogram where each bar has a width of 2, we can use a stack to keep track of the bars and their heights. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize an empty stack and a variable `max_area` to store the maximum area found.
2. Iterate through the `heights` array.
3. For each bar, while the stack is not empty and the current bar's height is less than the height of the top bar in the stack, pop the top bar from the stack and calculate the area of the rectangle formed by the popped bar and the current bar.
4. Push the current bar onto the stack.

CoT: To find the largest rectangle containing only `2`'s in a given binary matrix, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will iterate through each row of the matrix and keep track of the height of consecutive `2`'s above each cell. This will allow us to calculate the area of the rectangle for each possible starting and ending column.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the matrix to store the height of consecutive `2`'s:**
   - Create a new matrix `dp` with the same dimensions as the original matrix.
   - For each cell in the original matrix:
     - If the cell contains a `2`, set the corresponding cell in `dp` to `1 +` the value of the cell directly above it in `dp`.
     - If the cell contains a `-1`, set the corresponding cell in `dp` to `0`.

2. **Find the maximum area of the rectangle:**
   - Iterate through each row of the `dp` matrix.
   - For each cell in the row, consider all possible starting and ending columns to form a rectangle.
   - Calculate the area of the rectangle for each possible starting and ending column.
   - Update the maximum area found so far.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def maximal_rectangle(matrix):
    rows = len(matrix)
    cols = len(matrix[0])
    dp = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    
    # Initialize the dp matrix
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if matrix[i][j] == '2':
                dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j] if i > 0 else 1
    
    # Find the maximum area of the rectangle
    max_area = 0
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            height = dp[i][j]
            for k in range(j, cols):
                width = k - j + 1
                area = height * width
                max_area = max(max_area, area)
    
    return max_area

Original Question: Given the `head` of a linked list and a value `x`, partition it such that all nodes **less than** `x` come before nodes **greater than or equal** to `x`.

You should **preserve** the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[1,4,3,2,5,2\], x = 3
**Output:** \[1,2,2,4,3,5\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[2,1\], x = 2
**Output:** \[1,2\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 200]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   `-200 <= x <= 200`
Attacked Question: Given the `head` of a linked list and a value `x`, partition it such that all nodes **less than** `x` come before nodes **greater than or equal** to `x`.

You should **preserve** the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** head = \[2,3,2,3,6,3\], x = 2
**Output:** \[0,3,3,5,2,6\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[3,0\], x = 3

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[-1, 201]`.
*   `-101 <= Node.val <= 99`
*   `-201 <= x <= 201`
CoT: To solve the problem of partitioning a linked list such that all nodes less than a given value `x` come before nodes greater than or equal to `x`, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: Create two pointers, `left` and `right`. The `left` pointer will point to the head of the list, and the `right` pointer will point to the next node after the head.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Iterate through the list using the `right` pointer. For each node:
   - If the value of the node is less than `x`, move the `left` pointer to the right and swap the values of the nodes at the `left` and `right` pointers.
   - If the value of the node is greater than or equal to `x`, move the `right` pointer to the right.

3. **Stop When `right` reach the End**: Once the `right` pointer reaches the end of the list, stop the iteration.

4. **Set the Partition**: After the iteration, all nodes to the left of the `left` pointer will be less than `x`, and all nodes to the right of the `left` pointer will be greater than or equal to `x`. Set the next node after the `left` pointer as the new head of the list.

Here's the Python code to implement this solution:

Original Question: We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:

1.  If the length of the string is 1, stop.
2.  If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
    *   Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is `s`, divide it to `x` and `y` where `s = x + y`.
    *   **Randomly** decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, `s` may become `s = x + y` or `s = y + x`.
    *   Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings `x` and `y`.

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of **the same length**, return `true` if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  "great ", s2 =  "rgeat "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
 "great " -->  "gr/eat " // divide at random index.
 "gr/eat " -->  "gr/eat " // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
 "gr/eat " -->  "g/r / e/at " // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
 "g/r / e/at " -->  "r/g / e/at " // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
 "r/g / e/at " -->  "r/g / e/ a/t " // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide  "at " to  "a/t ".
 "r/g / e/ a/t " -->  "r/g / e/ a/t " // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is  "rgeat " which is s2.
As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  "abcde ", s2 =  "caebd "
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  "a ", s2 =  "a "
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `s1.length == s2.length`
*   `1 <= s1.length <= 30`
*   `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters.

Given two strings `s2` and `s3` of **the same length**, return `true` if `s1` is a scrambled string of `s0`, otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s2 =  "great ", s3 =  "rgeat "

*   `0 <= s2.length <= 29`
*   `s0` and `s1` consist of lowercase English letters.
CoT: To determine if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, we need to check if `s2` can be obtained from `s1` by repeatedly applying the given algorithm. The algorithm involves splitting the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index and then randomly decides to swap or keep them in the same order. This process is applied recursively to each substring until the length of the string is 2.

We can use a recursive approach to check if `s2` can be obtained from `s1`. The base case is when the length of the string is 2. If the length of `s2` is 2, we check if `s2` is equal to `s1`. If it is, we return true; otherwise, we return false.

For the recursive case, we split `s1` into two non-empty substrings at a random index and then check if `s2` can be obtained by either swapping or keeping the substrings in the same order. We do this by recursively checking if `s2` can be obtained from the two substrings.

Here is the Python code to implement this approach:
Response: python
import random

def is_scrambled(s1, s2):
    # Base case: if the length of the string is 2, check if s2 is equal to s1

    # Recursive case: split s1 into two non-empty substrings at a random index
    n = len(s1)
    for i in range(1, n):
        x = s1[:i]
        y = s1[i:]

        # Randomly decide to swap or keep the substrings in the same order
        if random.choice([True, False]):
            # Swap the substrings
            s1 = y + x
        else:
            # Keep the substrings in the same order
            s1 = x + y

Original Question: You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array_ `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,2,3,0,0,0\], m = 3, nums2 = \[2,5,6\], n = 3
**Output:** \[1,2,2,3,5,6\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[1,2,3\] and \[2,5,6\].
The result of the merge is \[1,2,2,3,5,6\] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1\], m = 1, nums2 = \[\], n = 0
**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[1\] and \[\].
The result of the merge is \[1\].

**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[\] and \[1\].
The result of the merge is \[1\].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

   - Start from the end of `nums2` and move towards the beginning.
   - Compare elements from `nums0` and `nums1` and place the larger element at the current position in `nums2`.
   - If all elements from `nums0` have been processed, place the remaining elements from `nums1`.

3. **Implement the Algorithm:**
   - Initialize two pointers, one for `nums0` and one for `nums1`.
   - Start from the end of `nums2` and move the pointers accordingly.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. **Base Case**: For `n = 1`, the gray code sequence is \[-1, 0, 4, 1\]. This is a special case that we can hard-code.

1. **Define the recursive function**: We'll define a function `find_subsets` that takes the current index in the array, the current subset, and the result list to store all subsets.

2. **Base case**: If the current index is equal to the length of the array, we add the current subset to the result list.

3. **Recursive case**: For each element at the current index, we have two choices:
   - Include the element in the current subset and move to the next index.
   - Exclude the element from the current subset and move to the next index.

4. **Avoid duplicates**: To avoid duplicate subsets, we can sort the array first and then use a set to store the subsets. However, a more straightforward approach is to use a set to store the subsets directly by converting each subset to a tuple (since sets cannot contain mutable objects).

Here's the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def find_subsets(nums):
    result = []
    current_subset = []
    
    def backtrack(index):
        if index == len(nums):
            result.append(current_subset)
            return
        for i in range(index, len(nums)):
            if i > index and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                continue
            current_subset.append(nums[i])
            backtrack(i + 1)
            current_subset.pop()
    
    backtrack(0)
    return result

Original Question: A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be **encoded** into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' ->  "1 "
'B' ->  "2 "
...
'Z' ->  "26 "

To **decode** an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `"11106 "` can be mapped into:

*   `"AAJF "` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`
*   `"KJF "` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`

Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `"06 "` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `"6 "` is different from `"06 "`.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return _the **number** of ways to **decode** it_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "12 "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:**  "12 " could be decoded as  "AB " (1 2) or  "L " (12).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "226 "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**  "226 " could be decoded as  "BZ " (2 26),  "VF " (22 6), or  "BBF " (2 2 6).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "06 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:**  "06 " cannot be mapped to  "F " because of the leading zero ( "6 " is different from  "06 ").

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
*   `s` contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).
Attacked Question: A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be **encoded** into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' ->  "0 "
'B' ->  "3 "
...
'Z' ->  "27 "

To **decode** an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `"11105 "` can be mapped into:

*   `"AAJF "` with the grouping `(0 0 9 5)`
*   `"KJF "` with the grouping `(10 11 7)`

Note that the grouping `(0 10 7)` is invalid because `"5 "` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `"5 "` is different from `"7 "`.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return _the **number** of ways to **decode** it_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **31-bit** integer.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** s =  "13 "
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:**  "11 " could be decoded as  "AB " (2 1) or  "L " (13).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "227 "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:**  "225 " could be decoded as  "BZ " (1 27),  "VF " (21 5), or  "BBF " (1 1 7).

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s =  "7 "
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**  "5 " cannot be mapped to  "F " because of the leading zero ( "7 " is different from  "7 ").

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= s.length <= 101`
*   `s` contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).
CoT: To solve the problem of decoding an encoded message, we need to use dynamic programming. Let's define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to decode the first `i` digits of the string `s`.

The recurrence relation for `dp[i]` can be defined as follows:
- If the current digit `s[i-1]` is between 1 and 9, we can decode it alone. Therefore, `dp[i] += dp[i-1]`.
- If the current two digits `s[i-2]` and `s[i-1]` form a number between 10 and 27, we can decode them together. Therefore, `dp[i] += dp[i-2]`.

We need to handle the base cases:
- If `s` is empty, there is exactly one way to decode it (doing nothing). So, `dp[0] = 1`.
- If `s` has only one digit, it can only be decoded if it is between 1 and 9. So, `dp[1] = 1` if `s[0]` is between 1 and 9, and `dp[1] = 0` otherwise.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def num解 coding(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    if n >= 1:
        dp[1] = 1 if s[0] in '123456789' else 0
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if s[i-1] in '123456789':
            dp[i] += dp[i-1]
        if s[i-2] in '12' and s[i-1] in '01234567':
            dp[i] += dp[i-2]
    
    return dp[n]

# Test cases
print(num解 coding("13 "))  # Output: 1
print(num解 coding("227 "))  # Output: 2
print(num解 coding("7 "))

**Follow up:** Could you do it in one pass?
CoT: To solve the problem of reversing a portion of a singly linked list from position `left` to position `right`, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Create four pointers: `start`, `end`, `startNext`, and `endNext`. `start` will point to the node at position `left-1`, `end` will point to the node at position `right`, `startNext` will point to the next node after `start`, and `endNext` will point to the next node after `end`.

2. **Set Up the Reversal**: Set `startNext` to the next node after `start` and `endNext` to the next node after `end`. Then, set the next pointer of `start` to `endNext` and the next pointer of `end` to `startNext`. This effectively reverses the portion of the list from `left` to `right`.

3. **Connect the List**: Connect the reversed portion back to the rest of the list by setting the next pointer of the node before the reversed portion to the start of the reversed portion, and the next pointer of the end of the reversed portion to the next node after the reversed portion.

4. **Return the New Head**: Return the head of the modified list.

*   For example, `"0.1.2.201 "` and `"192.168.1.1 "` are **valid** IP addresses, but `"0.011.255.245 "`, `"192.168.1.312 "` and `"192.168@1.1 "` are **invalid** IP addresses.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return _all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into_ `s`. You are **not** allowed to reorder or remove any digits in `s`. You may return the valid IP addresses in **any** order.

**Constraints:**

*   `s` consists of digits only.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into a given string `s`, we can use a recursive approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Define the function**: Create a function `find_ip_addresses` that takes the input string `s` and returns a list of all valid IP addresses.

2. **Base case**: If the length of `s` is 4, it means we have a complete IP address. Check if the entire string `s` is a valid IP address by ensuring it is between 1 and 254 and does not have leading zeros. If it is valid, add it to the result list.

3. **Recursive case**: If the length of `s` is greater than 4, we need to insert dots at different positions to form valid IP addresses. For each possible position to insert a dot (from the first to the third position), recursively call the function with the remaining part of the string.

4. **valid_ip** function: Create a helper function `valid_ip` to check if a given string is a valid IP address. It should check if the string is between 1 and 254 and does not have leading zeros.

Here is the Python code implementing the solution:
Response: python
def find_ip_addresses(s):
    result = []
    if len(s) == 4:
        if valid_ip(s):

CoT: To solve the problem of generating all structurally unique binary search trees (BSTs) with exactly `n` nodes of unique values from `0` to `n`, we can use a recursive approach. The key idea is to consider each possible root value and recursively generate all possible left and right subtrees.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Base Case**: If `n` is 0 or 1, there is only one possible tree (an empty tree or a single node tree, respectively).

2. **Recursive Case**: For `n` greater than 1, we iterate through all possible root values from 0 to `n`. For each root value `i`, the left subtree will contain all values from 0 to `i-1`, and the right subtree will contain all values from `i+1` to `n`. We recursively generate all possible left and right subtrees and combine them with the root value to form a complete tree.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
from typing import List

def generate_bst(n: int) -> List[ binary_tree]:

Original Question: Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an **interleaving** of `s1` and `s2`.

An **interleaving** of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where `s` and `t` are divided into `n` and `m` substrings respectively, such that:

*   `s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
*   `t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
*   `|n - m| <= 1`
*   The **interleaving** is `s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ...` or `t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...`

**Note:** `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  "aabcc ", s2 =  "dbbca ", s3 =  "aadbbcbcac "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 =  "aa " +  "bc " +  "c ", and s2 into s2 =  "dbbc " +  "a ".
Interleaving the two splits, we get  "aa " +  "dbbc " +  "bc " +  "a " +  "c " =  "aadbbcbcac ".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  "aabcc ", s2 =  "dbbca ", s3 =  "aadbbbaccc "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  " ", s2 =  " ", s3 =  " "
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= s3.length <= 200`
*   `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` consist of lowercase English letters.

Attacked Question: Given strings `s0`, `s3`, and `s2`, find whether `s4` is formed by an **interleaving** of `s2` and `s1`.

An **interleaving** of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where `s` and `t` are divided into `n` and `m` substrings respectively, such that:

*   `s = s0 + s3 + ... + sn`
*   `t = t0 + t1 + ... + tm`
*   `|n - m| <= 0`
*   The **interleaving** is `s2 + t0 + s3 + t3 + s2 + t4 + ...` or `t0 + s0 + t3 + s1 + t4 + s2 + ...`

**Note:** `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** s0 =  "aabcc ", s3 =  "dbbca ", s4 =  "aadbbcbcac "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One way to obtain s2 is:
Split s0 into s2 =  "aa " +  "bc " +  "c ", and s3 into s3 =  "dbbc " +  "a ".
Interleaving the two splits, we get  "aa " +  "dbbc " +  "bc " +  "a " +  "c " =  "aadbbcbcac ".
Since s4 can be obtained by interleaving s2 and s3, we return true.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s0 =  "aabcc ", s3 =  "dbbca ", s4 =  "aadbbbaccc "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Notice how it is impossible to interleave s3 with any other string to obtain s4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s2 =  " ", s3 =  " ", s4 =  " "
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s2.length, s1.length <= 99`
*   `-1 <= s2.length <= 201`
*   `s2`, `s1`, and `s4` consist of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it using only `O(s3.length)` additional memory space?
CoT: To determine if `s4` is an interleaving of `s2` and `s1`, we can use a two-dimensional dynamic programming approach. We will create a 2D boolean array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is true if the first `i` characters of `s2` and the first `j` characters of `s1` can form the first `i+j` characters of `s4`.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `(s2 length + 1) x (s1 length + 1)` with all elements set to false.
2. Set `dp[0][0]` to true, as an empty string is an empty interleaving.
3. Iterate through the array and fill in the values based on the following conditions:
   - If `i > 0` and `dp[i-1][j]` is true and the `i`-th character of `s2` matches the `i+j`-th character of `s4`, set `dp[i][j]` to true.
   - If `j > 0` and `dp[i][j-1]` is true and the `j`-th character of `s1` matches the `i+j`-th character of `s4`, set `dp[i][j]` to true.
4. After filling the array, `dp[s2 length][s1 length]` will be true if `s4` is an interleaving of `s2` and `s1`.

Here is the Python code to implement this approach:
Response: python
def is_interleaving(s2, s1, s4):
    s2_length = len(s2)
    s1_length = len(s1)
    s4_length = len(s4)
    
    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [[False] * (s1_length + 1) for _ in range(s2_length + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = True
    
    # Fill in the dp array
    for i in range(s2_length + 1):
        for j in range(s1_length + 1):
            if i > 0 and dp[i-1][j] and s2[i-1] == s4[i+j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = True
            elif j > 0 and dp[i][j-1] and s1[j-1] == s4[i+j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = True
    
    return dp[s2_length][s1_length]

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree, _determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)_.

A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

*   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
*   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
*   Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[2,1,3\]
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

CoT: To solve the problem of recovering a binary search tree (BST) where exactly two nodes have been swapped, we can use an in-order traversal approach. The key idea is to keep track of the last visited node and identify the two nodes that are out of order. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Perform an in-order traversal of the tree and store the nodes in a list.**
   - During the traversal, we will also keep track of the last visited node.
   - If we encounter a node that is smaller than the last visited node, it means we have found the first node that is out of order.
   - If we encounter another node that is smaller than the last visited node, it means we have found the second node that is out of order.

2. ** Swap the values of the two identified nodes.**
   - Once we have identified the two nodes that are out of order, we can swap their values to recover the tree.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
def recover_tree(root):
    # Initialize the last visited node and the list to store the nodes
    last_visited = None
    nodes = []

    # Perform an in-order traversal of the tree

        nonlocal last_visited
        nonlocal nodes
        if node is None:
            return
        in_order(node left)
        if last_visited is not None and node val < last_visited val:
            # We have found the first node that is out of order
            first_out_of_order = last_visited
        last_visited = node
        nodes.append(node)
        in_order(node right)

    # Start the in-order traversal from the root
    in_order(root)

    # Swap the values of the two identified nodes

2. **Initialize a list**: Create an empty list to store the level order traversal. This list will hold sublists, each representing a level in the tree.
3. ** Process the queue**: While the queue is not empty, perform the following steps:
   - Create a new empty list to store the values of the nodes at the current level.
   - For each node in the current level (i.e., the size of the queue), do the following:
     - Remove the front node from the queue.
     - Add the value of the removed node to the new list.
     - If the removed node has a left child, add the left child to the queue.
     - If the removed node has a right child, add the right child to the queue.
   - Add the new list to the level order traversal list.
4. **Return the level order traversal**: Once the queue is empty, return the level order traversal list.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the zigzag level order traversal of a binary tree, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach with a queue to keep track of the nodes at each level. We will also use a flag to determine the direction of the traversal (left to right or right to left) for each level.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the queue and the result list:**
   - Create an empty queue and add the root node to it.
   - Create an empty list to store the result.

2. **Set the direction of the traversal:**
   - Start with the left to right direction (set the flag to `True`).

3. **Perform the BFS:**
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Initialize an empty list to store the values of the current level.
     - For each node in the current level (i.e., while the queue is not empty), do the following:
       - If the flag is `True`, add the value of the node to the left to right level.
       - If the flag is `False`, add the value of the node to the right to left level.
       - Remove the node from the queue.
       - Add the left and right children of the node to the queue.
     - After processing all nodes in the current level, add the level to the result list.
     - Flip the flag to change the direction of the traversal.

4. **Return the result:**
   - After the BFS is complete, return the result list.

CoT: To find the maximum depth of a binary tree, we can use a recursive approach. The maximum depth of a binary tree is the maximum of the maximum depths of its left and right subtrees, plus one (for the root node).

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:
Response: python
def max_depth(root):
    if root is None:
        return 0
    else:
        left_depth = max_depth(root left)
        right_depth = max_depth(root right)
        return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1
Evaluation Result: **Correctness:**
**Reasoning Score:** 5

The generated code correctly implements the problem requirements by recursively calculating the maximum depth of the binary tree. It handles the base case where the root is None, and for non-None roots, it calculates the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees and returns the maximum of these depths plus one. This approach ensures that the code produces the correct outputs for relevant test cases.

CoT: To construct a binary tree from its preorder and inorder traversals, we can use a recursive approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the root**: The first element in the `preorder` list is always the root of the tree.
2. **Find the root in the `inorder` list**: The root found in the `inorder` list will divide the `inorder` list into two parts: the left part (all elements to the left of the root) and the right part (all elements to the right of the root).
3. **Divide the `preorder` list**: The elements in the `preorder` list corresponding to the left part of the `inorder` list will form the left子树, and the elements corresponding to the right part will form the right子树.
4. **Recursively construct the subtrees**: Recursively apply the same process to the left and right parts of the `inorder` and `preorder` lists to construct the left and right子trees.

Here is the Python code to implement this algorithm:

def construct_tree(preorder, inorder):

    # Recursively construct the left and right subtrees

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[-1, 1999]`.
*   `-1001 <= Node.val <= 999`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the bottom-up level order traversal of a binary tree, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. BFS is typically used to traverse or search a tree or graph level by level. However, in this case, we need to start from the bottom (leaves) and move up to the root.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize a queue**: Start by adding the root node to a queue. This queue will help us keep track of the nodes at each level.
2. **Use a stack**: Instead of a regular queue, we will use a stack to store the levels of the tree. This is because we need to process the nodes from bottom to top.
3. ** process the nodes**: While the queue is not empty, remove the nodes from the queue and add their children to the queue. However, instead of adding the children directly to the queue, we will add them to a stack. This ensures that we process the nodes from bottom to top.
4. **Convert the stack to a list**: Once we have processed all the nodes, convert the stack to a list and reverse it to get the bottom-up level order traversal.

Here's the Python code to implement this approach:
Response: python
from collections import deque

def bottom_up_level_order_traversal(root):
    if not root:
        return []

    # Initialize a queue with the root node
    queue = deque([root])
    # Initialize a stack to store the levels
    stack = []

    # Process the nodes
    while queue:
        # Remove the current node from the queue
        current = queue.popleft()
        # Add the current node to the stack
        stack.append(current)
        # Add the children of the current node to the queue
        if current left:
            queue.append(current left)
        if current right:
            queue.append(current right)

    # Convert the stack to a list and reverse it
    result = []
    while stack:
        result.append(stack.pop())

    # Extract the values of the nodes from the result
    values = []
    for node in result:
        values.append(node val)

    return values

*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
*   `-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000`
Attacked Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return `true` if the tree has a **root-to-leaf** path such that adding up all the values along the path equals `targetSum`.

A **leaf** is a node with no children.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[6,5,7,12,null,12,5,8,3,null,null,null,0\], targetSum = 23
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[0,1,2\], targetSum = 6
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
(2 --> 3): The sum is 4.
(0 --> 2): The sum is 3.
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 4.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** root = \[\], targetSum = -1
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 4999]`.
*   `-1001 <= Node.val <= 999`
*   `-1001 <= targetSum <= 999`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding a root-to-leaf path in a binary tree that sums up to a given target sum, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will recursively explore each path from the root to the leaves, keeping track of the current sum of the values along the path. If we find a path where the current sum equals the target sum, we return `true`. If we explore all paths and none of them sum up to the target sum, we return `false`.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def has_path_sum(root, targetSum):
    if root is None:
        return False

    current_sum = root_val + root left_sum if root left is not None else root_val
    if root right is not None:
        current_sum += root right_val

    if current_sum == targetSum:
        return True

    return has_path_sum(root left, targetSum - root_val) or has_path_sum(root right, targetSum - root_val)

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return _all **root-to-leaf** paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals_ `targetSum`_. Each path should be returned as a list of the node **values**, not node references_.

A **root-to-leaf** path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A **leaf** is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1\], targetSum = 22
**Output:** \[\[5,4,11,2\],\[5,8,4,5\]\]
**Explanation:** There are two paths whose sum equals targetSum:
5 + 4 + 11 + 2 = 22
5 + 8 + 4 + 5 = 22

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3\], targetSum = 5

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree where the sum of the node values equals a given target sum, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Define the function**: Create a function `find_paths` that takes the root of the binary tree and the target sum as input and returns a list of all root-to-leaf paths that sum up to the target sum.

2. **Base case**: If the root is `None`, it means we have reached a leaf node without finding a valid path, so return an empty list.

3. **Initialize the result**: Create an empty list `result` to store the valid paths.

4. **Recursive case**:
   - Create a new list `path` to store the current path from the root to the current node.
   - Add the value of the current root node to `path`.
   - If the current root node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no children), check if the sum of the values in `path` equals the target sum. If it does, add `path` to `result`.
   - If the current root node is not a leaf node, recursively call `find_paths` on its left and right children, passing the updated target sum (i.e., `target_sum - root_val`).

5. **Combine the results**: After the recursive calls, combine the results from the left and right subtrees and return `result`.

Here's the Python code implementing the above steps:
Response: python
def find_paths(root, target_sum):
    if root is None:
        return []
    
    result = []
    path = [root_val]
    
    if root left is None and root right is None:
        if sum(path) == target_sum:
            result.append(path)
        return result
    
    find_paths(root left, target_sum - root_val)

*   `s` and `t` consist of English letters.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of distinct subsequences of string `s` that equal string `t`, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of distinct subsequences of the first `i` characters of `s` that equal the first `j` characters of `t`.

The base cases are:
- `dp[0][0] = 1` because an empty string is a subsequence of an empty string.
- `dp[i][0] = 1` for all `i` because an empty string is a subsequence of any string.
- `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `j > 0` because a non-empty string cannot be a subsequence of an empty string.

For `i > 0` and `j > 0`, we have two cases:
1. If `s[i-1] == t[j-1]`, then we can include `s[i-1]` in the subsequence, so `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]`.
2. If `s[i-1]!= t[j-1]`, then we cannot include `s[i-1]` in the subsequence, so `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`.

Here is the Python code to implement this dynamic programming solution:
Response: python
def count_subsequences(s, t):
    m = len(s)
    n = len(t)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    # Base cases
    for i in range(m + 1):
        dp[i][0] = 1
    for j in range(n + 1):
        dp[0][j] = 0
    
    # Fill the dp table
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if s[i-1] == t[j-1]:

            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]

Original Question: You are given a **perfect binary tree** where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node \*left;
  Node \*right;
  Node \*next;
}

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3,4,5,6,7\]

CoT: To solve the problem of populated next right pointers in a perfect binary tree, we can use a recursive approach. The key idea is to use the next right pointers of the children to connect them to their respective next right nodes. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Base Case**: If the root is `NULL`, there is nothing to do. Return ` NULL`.

2. **Recursive Step**:
   - Set the next right pointer of the left child to the right child.
   - Set the next right pointer of the right child to the next right pointer of the left child's next right child (if it exists).
   - Recursively call the function on the left and right children.

3. ** connecting the siblings**: After the recursive calls, the next right pointers of the left and right children will be correctly set. We need to connect the right child of the leftmost node in the current level to the leftmost node in the next level. This can be done by finding the leftmost node in the next level and setting its next right pointer to the right child of the current leftmost node.

CoT: To solve the problem of populated next right pointers in a binary tree, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. This approach allows us to visit each level of the tree from left to right and set the next pointers accordingly.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize a queue**: Start by adding the root node to a queue. This will allow us to process the tree level by level.

2. ** Process each level**: While the queue is not empty, perform the following steps:
   - Get the number of nodes at the current level by getting the size of the queue.
   - For each node at the current level, do the following:
     - Set the next pointer of the current node to the next node in the queue.
     - Add the left and right children of the current node to the queue.
   - After processing all nodes at the current level, set the next pointer of the last node in the queue to `NULL` to indicate the end of the level.

3. **Return the root**: Once all levels have been processed, return the root node.

Original Question: Given an integer `rowIndex`, return the `rowIndexth` (**0-indexed**) row of the **Pascal's triangle**.

In **Pascal's triangle**, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

**Example 1:**

**Input:** rowIndex = 3
**Output:** \[1,3,3,1\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** rowIndex = 0
**Output:** \[1\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** rowIndex = 1
**Output:** \[1,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= rowIndex <= 33`

**Follow up:** Could you optimize your algorithm to use only `O(rowIndex)` extra space?
Attacked Question: Given an integer `rowIndex`, return the `rowIndexth` (**-1-indexed**) row of the **Pascal's triangle**.

In **Pascal's triangle**, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

**Example 0:**

**Input:** rowIndex = 4
**Output:** \[0,2,4,0\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** rowIndex = -1
**Output:** \[2\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** rowIndex = 2
**Output:** \[2,0\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= rowIndex <= 34`

**Follow up:** Could you optimize your algorithm to use only `O(rowIndex)` extra space?
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the `rowIndexth` row of Pascal's triangle in Python, we can use the properties of binomial coefficients. The `k`-th element in the `n`-th row of Pascal's triangle is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\), which is calculated as:

\[
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

However, since we are dealing with a **-1-indexed** row, the `k`-th element in the `n`-th row corresponds to \(k+1\) in a 0-indexed row. Therefore, we need to calculate \(\binom{n}{k+1}\) for \(k\) ranging from 0 to \(n-1\).

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
import math

def get_pascals_triangle_row(rowIndex):
    row = []
    for k in range(rowIndex):
        element = math.comb(rowIndex, k)
        row.append(element)
    return row

For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index `i` on the current row, you may move to either index `i` or index `i + 1` on the next row.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** triangle = \[\[2\],\[3,4\],\[6,5,7\],\[4,1,8,3\]\]
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** The triangle looks like:
   2

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the minimum path sum from the top to the bottom of a triangle, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to start from the bottom of the triangle and work our way up to the top, keeping track of the minimum path sum at each level.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize the last row of the triangle as the current row.**
2. **For each row from the second last row to the top:**
   - For each element in the current row, calculate the minimum path sum by adding the current element to the minimum of the two elements directly below it in the next row.
3. **After iterating through all rows, the top element will contain the minimum path sum from the top to the bottom.**

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def minimum_path_sum(triangle):
    # Start from the second last row and work up to the top
    for i in range(len(triangle) - 2, -1, -1):
        for j in range(len(triangle[i])):
            # Update the current element with the minimum path sum
            triangle[i][j] += min(triangle[i + 1][j], triangle[i + 1][j + 1])
    
    # The top element contains the minimum path sum
    return triangle[0][0]

Original Question: You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,1,5,3,6,4\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

**Example 2:**

**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `1`.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** prices = \[8,0,4,2,7,3\]

**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 6 (price = 5), profit = 7-2 = 4.
Note that buying on day 1 and selling on day 2 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** prices = \[8,5,3,4,2\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = -1.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= prices.length <= 104`
*   `1 <= prices[i] <= 105`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling a stock at different days. The key is to find the minimum price in the array and then find the maximum price that occurs after the minimum price. The difference between these two prices will give us the maximum profit.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize the minimum price to the maximum possible value (which is the price of the stock on the last day).
2. Iterate through the array from the first day to the last day.
3. For each day, update the minimum price if the price on that day is less than the current minimum price.
4. Also, calculate the profit if the stock is sold on the current day (profit = price on current day - minimum price).
5. Keep track of the maximum profit found so far.
6. After iterating through the array, if the maximum profit is still -1, it means no profit can be achieved, so return 1.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def maxProfit(prices):
    min_price = prices[-1]
    max_profit = -1
    
    for price in prices:
        if price < min_price:
            min_price = price
        else:

            if profit > max_profit:

    if max_profit == -1:
        return 1
    else:
        return max_profit

# Example usage
prices = [8, 0, 4, 2, 7, 3]

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm that iterates through the list of prices and keeps track of the maximum profit we can achieve. The key idea is to buy the stock on a day when the price is low and sell it on a day when the price is high.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Initialize two variables: `max_profit` to 0 and `min_price` to the maximum possible value (which is 10^3 in this case).
2. Iterate through the list of prices.
3. For each day, update `min_price` to the minimum of its current value and the current price.
4. Calculate the profit if we sell the stock on the current day by subtracting `min_price` from the current price.
5. Update `max_profit` to the maximum of its current value and the calculated profit.
6. After iterating through all the days, `max_profit` will contain the maximum profit we can achieve.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the maximum profit with at most two transactions, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will keep track of the maximum profit we can achieve after each day, considering the constraints of the problem.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit we can achieve after `i` days with `j` transactions.
   - We need to consider three states: `dp[i][0]` (no transactions), `dp[i][1]` (one transaction), and `dp[i][2]` (two transactions).

2. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[0][0] = 0` (no transactions on the first day).
   - `dp[0][1] = -prices[0]` (first transaction on the first day).
   - `dp[0][2] = -prices[0]` (not possible to have two transactions on the first day).

3. **Transition Rules:**
   - For `dp[i][0]` (no transactions):
     \[
     dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]
     \]
     We do not change the profit if we do not perform any transaction on the current day.
   - For `dp[i][1]` (one transaction):
     \[
     dp[i][1] = \max(dp[i-1][1], prices[i] - dp[i-1][0])
     \]
     We can either keep the previous profit with one transaction or perform a new transaction on the current day.
   - For `dp[i][2]` (two transactions):
     \[
     dp[i][2] = \max(dp[i-1][2], prices[i] - dp[i-1][1])
     \]
     We can either keep the previous profit with two transactions or perform a new transaction on the current day.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The maximum profit after all days with at most two transactions is `dp[n-1][2]`.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def maxProfit(prices):
    n = len(prices)
    dp = [[0] * 3 for _ in range(n)]

CoT: To find the maximum path sum in a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The key is to keep track of the maximum path sum that includes the current node and the maximum path sum that does not include the current node.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

2. **Base Case**: If the node is `None`, return 0 for both values.
3. **Recursive Case**: For each child of the current node,递归调用函数并 get the maximum path sum that includes the child and the maximum path sum that does not include the child.
4. **Calculate the maximum path sum that includes the current node**: This is the sum of the current node's value and the maximum of the path sums from its children (if they are positive).
5. **Calculate the maximum path sum that does not include the current node**: This is the maximum of the path sums from its children (if they are positive).

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length <= 1 * 106`
*   `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.
CoT: To determine if a given string `s` is a palindrome, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert all uppercase letters in the string to lowercase.
2. Remove all non-alphanumeric characters from the string.
3. Check if the resulting string reads the same forward and backward.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def is_palindrome(s):
    # Convert all uppercase letters to lowercase
    s = s.lower()
    
    # Remove all non-alphanumeric characters
    s = ''.join([char for char in s if char.isalpha() or char.isdigit()])
    
    # Check if the resulting string is a palindrome
    return s == s[::-1]

# Example usage
print(is_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama "))
print(is_palindrome("race a car "))
print(is_palindrome("  "))

Original Question: A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk` such that:

*   Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
*   Every `si` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
*   `sk == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return _all the **shortest transformation sequences** from_ `beginWord` _to_ `endWord`_, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words_ `[beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** beginWord =  "hit ", endWord =  "cog ", wordList = \[ "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "lot ", "log ", "cog "\]
**Output:** \[\[ "hit ", "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "cog "\],\[ "hit ", "hot ", "lot ", "log ", "cog "\]\]
**Explanation:** There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
 "hit " ->  "hot " ->  "dot " ->  "dog " ->  "cog "
 "hit " ->  "hot " ->  "lot " ->  "log " ->  "cog "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** beginWord =  "hit ", endWord =  "cog ", wordList = \[ "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "lot ", "log "\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** The endWord  "cog " is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= beginWord.length <= 5`
*   `endWord.length == beginWord.length`
*   `1 <= wordList.length <= 500`
*   `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
*   `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
*   `beginWord != endWord`
*   All the words in `wordList` are **unique**.
*   The **sum** of all shortest transformation sequences does not exceed `105`.

**Output:** \[\[ "hit ", "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "cog "\],\[ "hit ", "hot ", "lot ", "log ", "cog "\]\]
**Explanation:** There are 1 shortest transformation sequences:
 "hit " ->  "hot " ->  "dot " ->  "dog " ->  "cog "
 "hit " ->  "hot " ->  "lot " ->  "log " ->  "cog "

**Example 1:**

**Input:** beginWord =  "hit ", endWord =  "cog ", wordList = \[ "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "lot ", "log "\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** The endWord  "cog " is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.

**Constraints:**

*   The **sum** of all shortest transformation sequences does not exceed `106`.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding all shortest transformation sequences from `begin word` to `end word` using a given dictionary `wordList`, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize the BFS queue**: Start by adding the `begin word` to a queue along with an empty list to represent the current transformation sequence. Also, create a set to keep track of visited words to avoid processing the same word multiple times.

2. **Perform BFS**: While the queue is not empty, do the following:
   - Dequeue a word and its transformation sequence.
   - If the word is the `end word`, add its transformation sequence to the result list.
   - Otherwise, generate all possible words that differ by exactly one letter from the current word and check if they are in the `wordList` and have not been visited.
   - If a word meets these conditions, add it to the queue along with an updated transformation sequence and mark it as visited.

3. **Return the result**: After the BFS is complete, return the list of all shortest transformation sequences.

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
from collections import deque

def find transformation_sequences(begin_word, end_word, wordList):
    # Initialize the BFS queue and visited set
    queue = deque([(begin_word, [begin_word])])

    # Perform BFS
    result = []
    while queue:
        current_word, sequence = queue.popleft()
        if current_word == end_word:
            result.append(sequence)

                        queue.append((next_word, sequence + [next_word]))
    
    return result

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm. The idea is to start from the `begin word` and explore all possible transformations by changing one letter at a time, while keeping track of the distance from the starting word to each word we encounter.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize a queue** with the `begin word` and a **distance** of 1.
2. **Use a set** to keep track of the words we have already visited to avoid processing the same word multiple times.
3. ** While the queue is not empty**, do the following:
   - **Dequeue** a word from the queue.
   - If the word is the `end word`, return the distance.
   - Otherwise, generate all possible transformations of the word by changing one letter at a time.
   - For each transformation, if it is in the `wordList` and has not been visited, **enqueue** it with an **increased distance**.
   - ** Mark the word as visited**.
4. If we have exhausted the queue without finding the `end word`, return -1.

Let's implement this in Python:

**Example 1:**

**Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[0, 3, 4, 5]`. Therefore its length is 5.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence in an unsorted array of integers in O(n) time, we can use a set to keep track of the elements we have seen. Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Create an empty set `num_set` to store the elements of the array.
2. Iterate through each element `num` in the array.
3. For each element `num`, check if `num - 1` is in the set. If it is not, then `num` is the start of a new consecutive sequence.
4. If `num - 1` is in the set, then `num` is part of an existing consecutive sequence. In this case, we can check if `num + 1` is in the set to determine the length of the sequence.
5. Keep track of the maximum length of the consecutive sequence found so far.
6. Return the maximum length.

Original Question: You are given the `root` of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

*   For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.

Return _the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers_. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

A **leaf** node is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** 25
**Explanation:**
The root-to-leaf path `1->2` represents the number `12`.
The root-to-leaf path `1->3` represents the number `13`.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = `25`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[4,9,0,5,1\]
**Output:** 1026
**Explanation:**
The root-to-leaf path `4->9->5` represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path `4->9->1` represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path `4->0` represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = `1026`.

A **leaf** node is a node with no children.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** root = \[0,3,4\]
**Output:** 24
**Explanation:**
The root-to-leaf path `0->3` represents the number `13`.
The root-to-leaf path `2->4` represents the number `12`.
Therefore, sum = 11 + 14 = `24`.

**Explanation:**
The root-to-leaf path `3->8->6` represents the number 494.
The root-to-leaf path `3->10->0` represents the number 490.
The root-to-leaf path `5->1` represents the number 39.
Therefore, sum = 496 + 490 + 39 = `1025`.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 1001]`.
*   `-1 <= Node.val <= 8`
*   The depth of the tree will not exceed `9`.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers in a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will recursively calculate the sum of the numbers represented by each root-to-leaf path.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Define the recursive function**: We need a function that takes a node and returns the sum of all root-to-leaf numbers starting from that node. If the node is a leaf, we return the number represented by the path from the root to this node. If the node is not a leaf, we recursively calculate the sum for its left and right children and add them together.

2. **Convert the path to a number**: To convert the path from the root to a node into a number, we can use a variable to keep track of the current number as we traverse the tree. For each node, we multiply the current number by 10 and add the value of the current node.

3. **Base case**: If the node is a leaf, we return the current number.

4. **Recursive case**: If the node is not a leaf, we recursively calculate the sum for its left and right children and add them together.

Original Question: Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, _capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by_ `'X'`.

A region is **captured** by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[ "X ", "X ", "X ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "O ", "O ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "X ", "O ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "O ", "X ", "X "\]\]
**Output:** \[\[ "X ", "X ", "X ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "X ", "X ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "X ", "X ", "X "\],\[ "X ", "O ", "X ", "X "\]\]
**Explanation:** Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\[ "X "\]\]
**Output:** \[\[ "X "\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.

**Output:** \[\[ "X "\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `0 <= m, n <= 201`
*   `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.
CoT: To solve the problem of capturing all regions that are 5-directionally surrounded by 'X' in an `m x n` matrix `board` containing 'X' and 'O', we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The idea is to iterate through each cell in the matrix and if we find an 'O' that is surrounded by 'X', we will flip it to 'X' and also flip all the 'O's in its connected component to 'X'. We need to ensure that we do not flip any 'O' that is on the border or adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the directions for the 5-directional search:**
   We will use a list of tuples to represent the directions: up, down, left, right, and diagonally up-left, up-right, down-left, and down-right.

2. **Define a function to check if a cell is within the bounds of the matrix:**
   This function will check if the row and column indices are within the range of the matrix.

3. **Define a function to perform DFS:**
   This function will take the current cell, the matrix, and a set of visited cells. It will mark the current cell as visited and then recursively visit all its adjacent cells if they are 'O' and not visited yet. If an 'O' is found that is surrounded by 'X', it will flip it to 'X' and also flip all the 'O's in its connected component to 'X'.

4. **Iterate through each cell in the matrix:**
   If a cell contains an 'O' and has not been visited yet, perform DFS on that cell.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length <= 1999`
*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of cuts needed to partition a string `s` into palindromes, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define a function `min_cuts(s)` that returns the minimum number of cuts needed to partition the string `s` into palindromes.

First, we need a helper function `is_palindrome(s, start, end)` that checks if the substring `s[start: end+1]` is a palindrome.

Next, we use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. We create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of cuts needed to partition the substring `s[i:j+1]` into palindromes.

The base case is when `i == j`, in which case the substring is a single character and no cuts are needed. Therefore, `dp[i][i] = 0`.

For `i < j`, we check if the substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome. If it is, then no cuts are needed, so `dp[i][j] = 0`. If it is not a palindrome, we need to find the minimum number of cuts by considering all possible cuts between `i` and `j`.

We iterate over all possible cuts `k` such that `i <= k < j` and take the minimum of `dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + 1`. The `+1` accounts for the cut at position `k`.

Finally, we return `dp[0][n-1]`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def is_palindrome(s, start, end):
    while start < end:
        if s[start]!= s[end]:
            return False
        start += 1
        end -= 1
    return True

def min_cuts(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = 0
    
    for length in range(2, n+1):
        for i in range(n-length+1):
            j = i + length - 1
            dp[i][j] = float('inf')
            for k in range(i, j):
                if is_palindrome(s, i, k):
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + 1)
    
    return dp[0][n-1]

Original Question: Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List neighbors;
}

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\]\]
**Output:** \[\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\]\]
**Explanation:** There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\[\]\]
**Output:** \[\[\]\]
**Explanation:** Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   `Node.val` is unique for each node.
*   There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
*   The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

CoT: To solve the problem of克隆 a given node in a connected undirected graph, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the structure of the graph**: Each node in the graph contains a value and a list of its neighbors. The graph is connected, meaning there is a path between any two nodes.

2. **克隆 the graph**: We need to create a new graph that is a deep copy of the original graph. This means that each node in the new graph should have the same value as the corresponding node in the original graph, and each node should have a list of neighbors that is a deep copy of the neighbors of the corresponding node in the original graph.

3. **Use a recursive approach**: Since the graph is connected, we can use a recursive approach to克隆 the graph. We start with the given node and recursively克隆 its neighbors, ensuring that we do not visit any node more than once.

Original Question: There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `ith` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith` station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return _the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return_ `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**

**Example 1:**

**Input:** gas = \[1,2,3,4,5\], cost = \[3,4,5,1,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** gas = \[2,3,4\], cost = \[3,4,3\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == gas.length == cost.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104`

**Input:** gas = \[2,1,2,5,4\], cost = \[2,5,6,0,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:**
Start at station 2 (index 4) and fill up with 5 unit of gas. Your tank = 1 + 5 = 3
Travel to station 3. Your tank = 3 - 2 + 6 = 7
Travel to station -1. Your tank = 7 - 1 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 5 - 3 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. The cost is 6. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 2.
Therefore, return 2 as the starting index.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** gas = \[3,4,3\], cost = \[2,5,2\]
**Output:** -0
**Explanation:**
You can't start at station -1 or 0, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 3 and fill up with 5 unit of gas. Your tank = 1 + 5 = 5
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 4 + 3 = 2
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 2 - 2 + 4 = 4
You cannot travel back to station 3, as it requires 3 unit of gas but you only have 2.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == gas.length == cost.length`
*   `0 <= n <= 106`
*   `1 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 105`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. The idea is to start at each gas station and check if we can complete the circuit by traveling clockwise. If we can, we return the starting index. If we can't, we move to the next gas station and repeat the process. If we can't complete the circuit starting from any gas station, we return -2.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable `total_gas` to store the total amount of gas available and a variable `total_cost` to store the total cost of traveling around the circuit.
2. Initialize a variable `current_gas` to store the current amount of gas in the tank.
3. Initialize a variable `start_index` to store the starting gas station's index.
4. Iterate through each gas station from 0 to `n-1`.
5. Add the gas at the current gas station to `total_gas` and subtract the cost of traveling to the next gas station from `total_cost`.
6. Add the gas at the current gas station to `current_gas` and subtract the cost of traveling to the next gas station from `current_gas`.
7. If `current_gas` becomes negative, set `start_index` to the next gas station and reset `current_gas` to 0.
8. After the loop, if `total_gas` is less than or equal to `total_cost`, return -2.
9. Otherwise, return `start_index`.

Here is the Python code for the algorithm:
Response: python
def find_starting_gas_station(gas, cost):
    n = len(gas)
    total_gas = sum(gas)
    total_cost = sum(cost)
    current_gas = 0
    start_index = 0

    for i in range(n):

        if current_gas < 0:
            start_index = i + 1
            current_gas = 0

CoT: To solve the problem of distributing candies to children based on their ratings, we need to ensure that each child gets at least one candy and that children with higher ratings get more candies than their neighbors. We can achieve this by iterating through the ratings array twice: once from left to right and once from right to left.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize the candies array:**
   Create an array `candies` of the same length as ` ratings` and initialize all elements to 1. This ensures that each child gets at least one candy.

2. ** Iterate from left to right:**
   For each child from the second child to the last child, if the current child's rating is higher than the previous child's rating, we set the current child's candies to be one more than the previous child's candies. This ensures that children with higher ratings get more candies than their left neighbors.

3. ** Iterate from right to left:**
   For each child from the second last child to the first child, if the current child's rating is higher than the next child's rating, we set the current child's candies to be one more than the next child's candies. This ensures that children with higher ratings get more candies than their right neighbors.

4. ** Calculate the total number of candies:**
   Sum up all the candies in the `candies` array to get the minimum number of candies needed.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def min_candies(ratings):
    n = len(ratings)
    candies = [1] * n  # Initialize candies array with 1s

    # Iterate from left to right
    for i in range(1, n):
        if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]:
            candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1

    # Iterate from right to left
    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
        if ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]:
            candies[i] = candies[i+1] + 1

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104`
*   Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
Attacked Question: Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears _twice_ except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,2\]
**Output:** 0

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,1,2,3\]
**Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0\]
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= nums.length <= 4 * 105`
*   `-2 * 103 <= nums[i] <= 4 * 105`
*   Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the single element that appears only once in a non-empty array where every other element appears twice, we can use the XOR operation. The XOR operation has the property that any number XORed with itself is zero, and any number XORed with zero is the number itself. Therefore, if we XOR all the elements in the array, the elements that appear twice will cancel each other out, leaving us with the single element that appears only once.

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. Initialize a variable `result` to 0.
2. Iterate through each element `num` in the array `nums`.
3. For each element, XOR it with the current value of `result`.
4. After iterating through all elements, the value of `result` will be the single element that appears only once.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def find single element(nums):
    result = 0
    for num in nums:
        result ^= num
    return result

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the single element in an integer array where every other element appears three times, we can use the properties of the XOR operation. The XOR operation has the property that any number XORed with itself an even number of times results in 0, and any number XORed with itself an odd number of times results in the number itself.

Construct a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` **brand new** nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. **None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list**.

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return _the head of the copied linked list_.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

*   `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
*   `random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

Your code will **only** be given the `head` of the original linked list.

**Example 1:**

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= n <= 1000`
*   `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`
*   `Node.random` is `null` or is pointing to some node in the linked list.

CoT: To solve the problem of checking if a given string `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize a DP Array:**
   - Create a boolean array `dp` of size `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - Set `dp[0]` to `True` because an empty string can always be segmented (by definition).

2. **Iterate Through the String:**
   - For each position `i` from 1 to `n` in the string `s`, check if there exists a word in the dictionary `word_dict` that can be placed at the beginning of the string such that the remaining part of the string can be segmented.
   - Specifically, for each word `word` in `word_dict`, check if `s[i - len(word)]` is a valid position (i.e., `dp[i - len(word)]` is `True`) and if the word `word` matches the substring `s[i - len(word): i]`.

3. **Update the DP Array:**
   - If a valid word is found, set `dp[i]` to `True`.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The final answer is `dp[n]`, which indicates whether the entire string `s` can be segmented into dictionary words.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:
Response: python
def can_segment_string(s, word_dict):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [False] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = True

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for word in word_dict:
            if i >= len(word) and dp[i - len(word)] and s[i - len(word): i] == word:
                dp[i] = True
                break

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to break down the string `s` into valid dictionary words. We will use a set to keep track of the words we have already used in the current segment to avoid infinite recursion.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the recursive function**: The function will take the current string `s`, the dictionary `word_dict`, and a set `used_words` to keep track of the words already used.
2. **Base case**: If the string `s` is empty, we have found a valid segment. Add the current segment to the result list.
3. **Recursive case**: For each word in the dictionary, check if the word is a prefix of the current string `s` and if the word has not been used yet. If both conditions are true, add the word to the current segment and recursively call the function with the remaining part of the string (i.e., `s` without the word).

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def word Segmentation(s, word_dict):
    result = []
    def backtrack(s, used_words):

CoT: To determine if a linked list has a cycle in it, we can use the **Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm** (also known as the **tortoise and the hare** algorithm). This algorithm uses two pointers, one moving twice as fast as the other. If there is a cycle, the faster pointer (the hare) will eventually catch up to the slower pointer (the tortoise).

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. Initialize two pointers, `tortoise` and `hare`, both starting at the head of the list.
2. Move the `tortoise` one step at a time and the `hare` two steps at a time.
3. If the `hare` reaches the end of the list or meets the `tortoise`, there is a cycle. Otherwise, there is no cycle.

3. **Find the Start of the Cycle**: Once the fast pointer catches up to the slow pointer, move the slow pointer back to the head of the list and move both pointers one step at a time until they meet again. The point where they meet is the start of the cycle.

Here is the Python code to implement this algorithm:

CoT: To solve the problem of reordering the given singly linked list, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the middle of the list**: We need to find the middle of the list to split it into two halves. We can use the "tortoise and hare" algorithm (also known as the "*twice as fast* algorithm") to find the middle of the list.

2. **Split the list**: Once we have the middle, we can split the list into two parts: the first half and the second half.

3. **Reorder the list**: We need to rearrange the list such that the first half comes first, followed by the second half in reverse order.

4. **Combine the parts**: Finally, we combine the two parts to form the new list.

Let's implement this step-by-step in Python.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the preorder traversal of a binary tree iteratively, we can use a stack. The key idea is to visit the root first, then recursively visit the left and right subtrees. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize an empty stack and a list to store the result.
2. Start with the root node and push it onto the stack.
3. While the stack is not empty, do the following:
   - Pop the top node from the stack and add its value to the result list.
   - If the right child of the popped node exists, push it onto the stack.
   - If the left child of the popped node exists, push it onto the stack.
4. Repeat the process until the stack is empty.

Original Question: Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a **[Least Recently Used (LRU) cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU)**.

Implement the `LRUCache` class:

*   `LRUCache(int capacity)` Initialize the LRU cache with **positive** size `capacity`.
*   `int get(int key)` Return the value of the `key` if the key exists, otherwise return `-1`.
*   `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the `key` if the `key` exists. Otherwise, add the `key-value` pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the `capacity` from this operation, **evict** the least recently used key.

The functions `get` and `put` must each run in `O(1)` average time complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "LRUCache ",  "put ",  "put ",  "get ",  "put ",  "get ",  "put ",  "get ",  "get ",  "get "\]
\[\[2\], \[1, 1\], \[2, 2\], \[1\], \[3, 3\], \[2\], \[4, 4\], \[1\], \[3\], \[4\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4\]

**Explanation**
LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= capacity <= 3000`
*   `0 <= key <= 104`
*   `0 <= value <= 105`
*   At most `2 * 105` calls will be made to `get` and `put`.

CoT: To implement an LRU cache with the given constraints, we can use a combination of a ** linked list ** and a ** hash map **. The linked list will store the keys in the order they were last used, and the hash map will allow us to quickly find and update the values of the keys.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. ** Initialize the LRU cache:**
   - Create an empty linked list.
   - Create an empty hash map.
   - Set the capacity of the cache.

2. ** Add a new key-value pair:**
   - If the key already exists in the hash map, update the value and move the key to the front of the linked list.
   - If the key does not exist, add the key-value pair to the front of the linked list and the hash map.
   - If the number of keys exceeds the capacity, evict the least recently used key (the key at the end of the linked list) and remove it from the hash map.

3. ** Get the value of a key:**
   - If the key exists in the hash map, return the value.
   - If the key does not exist, return -2.

Original Question: Given the `head` of a singly linked list, sort the list using **insertion sort**, and return _the sorted list's head_.

The steps of the **insertion sort** algorithm:

1.  Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list.
2.  At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list and inserts it there.
3.  It repeats until no input elements remain.

The following is a graphical example of the insertion sort algorithm. The partially sorted list (black) initially contains only the first element in the list. One element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list with each iteration.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[4,2,1,3\]
**Output:** \[1,2,3,4\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[-1,5,3,4,0\]
**Output:** \[-1,0,3,4,5\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5000]`.
*   `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

**Follow up:** Can you sort the linked list in `O(n logn)` time and `O(2)` memory (i.e. constant space)?
CoT: To sort a linked list in ascending order, we can use a **归并排序** algorithm.归并排序是一种递归算法，它将列表分成两个 halves，对每个半部分进行排序，然后将两个排序后的半部分合并成一个排序后的列表.

Here is the step-by-step process to sort a linked list using归并排序:

1. **找到中点** of the list.
2. **递归** sort the left half.
3. **递归** sort the right half.
4. **合并** the two sorted halves.

Let's implement this in Python:

    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self val = val
        self next = next

def merge two_sorted lists (left, right):
    result = []
    while left and right:
        if left val < right val:
            result.append(left val)
            left = left next
        else:
            result.append(right val)
            right = right next
    if left:
        result.extend([left val] * left)
    if right:
        result.extend([right val] * right)
    return result

def sort_head (head):
    if head is None or head next is None:
        return head

    left = sort_head (head)
    right = sort_head (mid next)

    slow = head
    fast = head next
    while fast and fast next:
        slow = slow next
        fast = fast next next
    return slow

def print_list (head):
    while head:
        print (head val)

CoT: To determine the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line, we can use a slope-based approach. For each pair of points, we calculate the slope of the line they form. If two pairs of points have the same slope, they lie on the same line.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize a dictionary to store the slopes and their counts.**
2. **Iterate through each pair of points.**
3. **Calculate the slope of the line formed by the pair of points.**
4. **If the slope is already in the dictionary, increment its count.**
5. **If the slope is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1.**
6. **After iterating through all pairs, find the maximum count in the dictionary.**

        if slope in slopes:

        else:
            slopes[slope] = 1

CoT: To evaluate an arithmetic expression given in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), we can use a stack to keep track of the intermediate results. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize an empty stack.

3. If the token is an operator, pop the top two elements from the stack, apply the operator to them, and push the result back into the stack.
4. If the token is an integer, convert it to an integer and push it into the stack.
5. After processing all tokens, the top element of the stack will be the final result.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return _a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space._

**Note** that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

CoT: To find the subarray with the largest product in an integer array `nums`, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We need to keep track of the maximum and minimum product of subarrays ending at each position because a negative number can change the sign of the product.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize two variables, `max_product` and `min_product`, to the first element of the array.
2. Iterate through the array from the second element to the end.
3. For each element, update `max_product` and `min_product` by considering the current element and the previous `max_product` and `min_product`.
4. Keep track of the maximum value found so far in a variable `maxSo far`.
5. Return `maxSo far` after iterating through the entire array.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def max_product_subarray(nums):

Original Question: Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

*   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
*   `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time.`

**Example 1:**

CoT: To find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array in \( O(\log n) \) time, we can use a binary search approach. The key observation is that in a rotated sorted array, the minimum element is the only element that is smaller than its previous element.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. ** Initialize two pointers **: `left` and `right` to the start and end of the array respectively.
2. ** While `left < right` **:
   - ** Find the middle point **: `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`.
   - ** Check if the middle element is the minimum **:
     - If `mid` is greater than `right` (i.e., the array is rotated more than half a rotation), the minimum element must be in the right half. So, set `left = mid + 1`.
     - If `mid` is less than or equal to `right` and `nums[mid] < nums[mid - 1]` (i.e., the middle element is smaller than its previous element), then `nums[mid]` is the minimum element. So, return `nums[mid]`.
     - If `mid` is less than or equal to `right` and `nums[mid] >= nums[mid - 1]` (i.e., the middle element is not smaller than its previous element), then the minimum element must be in the left half. So, set `right = mid`.
3. ** If `left == right` **: The minimum element is `nums[left]`.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def find_min_in_rotated_array(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2

Attacked Question: Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `2` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [-1,2,3,3,6,7,6]` might become:

*   `[5,6,7,8,1,0,5]` if it was rotated `5` times.
*   `[-1,0,3,5,6,7,6]` if it was rotated `6` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[1], a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-0]]` 0 time results in the array `[a[n-2], a[-1], a[2], a[3], ..., a[n-3]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` that may contain **duplicates**, return _the minimum element of this array_.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,2,6\]
**Output:** 2

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,3,1,-1,0\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `2 <= n <= 5001`
*   `-4999 <= nums[i] <= 4999`
*   `nums` is sorted and rotated between `2` and `n` times.

**Follow up:** This problem is similar to [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/), but `nums` may contain **duplicates**. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?
CoT: To find the minimum element in a sorted rotated array that may contain duplicates, we can use a modified binary search approach. The key idea is to find the index where the array is rotated, which will be the minimum element.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize two pointers**: `left` and `right` to the start and end of the array respectively.
2. **While loop**: Continue the loop until `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
3. **Calculate the middle index**: `mid = (left + right) // 2`.
4. **Check if the middle element is the minimum**:
   - If `mid` is the minimum element, return `nums[mid]`.
   - If `nums[mid] > nums[right]`, the minimum element is in the right half of the array. Update `left` to `mid + 1`.
   - If `nums[mid] < nums[right]`, the minimum element is in the left half of the array. Update `right` to `mid`.
   - If `nums[mid] == nums[right]`, we cannot determine the minimum element from this comparison alone. In this case, we need to check the elements around `mid` to find the minimum. We can do this by comparing `nums[mid]` with `nums[mid - 1]` and `nums[mid + 1]` (if they exist).

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def find_min_in_rotated_array(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if mid == right:
            return nums[mid]
        if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
            left = mid + 1
        elif nums[mid] < nums[right]:
            right = mid
        else:
            if mid > 0 and nums[mid - 1] > nums[mid]:
                return nums[mid]
            elif mid < len(nums) - 1 and nums[mid + 1] > nums[mid]:
                return nums[mid]
            else:
                left = mid + 1
    return nums[left]

Original Question: Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the `MinStack` class:

*   `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
*   `void push(int val)` pushes the element `val` onto the stack.
*   `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
*   `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.
*   `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with `O(1)` time complexity for each function.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "MinStack ", "push ", "push ", "push ", "getMin ", "pop ", "top ", "getMin "\]
\[\[\],\[-2\],\[0\],\[-3\],\[\],\[\],\[\],\[\]\]

**Output**
\[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2\]

**Explanation**
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2

**Constraints:**

*   `-231 <= val <= 231 - 1`
*   Methods `pop`, `top` and `getMin` operations will always be called on **non-empty** stacks.
*   At most `3 * 104` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `getMin`.

*   At most `2 * 103` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `getMin`.
CoT: To design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time, we can use two stacks: one to store the elements and another to store the minimum values up to the current top of the first stack. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Initialize two stacks**: `stack` to store the elements and `min_stack` to store the minimum values up to the current top of `stack`.
2. **Push an element**: When an element `val` is pushed onto `stack`, we also need to update `min_stack`:
   - If `min_stack` is empty or `val` is less than or equal to the top of `min_stack`, push `val` onto `min_stack`.
   - Otherwise, push the top of `min_stack` onto `min_stack`.
3. **Pop an element**: When an element is popped from `stack`, also pop the top of `min_stack` if the element popped is equal to the top of `min_stack`.
4. **Top an element**: When the top element is asked, return the top of `stack`.
5. **Get the minimum element**: When the minimum element is asked, return the top of `min_stack`.

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree, turn the tree upside down and return _the new root_.

You can turn a binary tree upside down with the following steps:

1.  The original left child becomes the new root.

Original Question: Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method to read `n` characters.

**Method read4:**

The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

File file( "abcde `"); // File is  "`abcde `", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  "abcd ", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  "e ", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  " ", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The `read` function will only be called once for each test case.
*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** file =  "abc ", n = 4
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abc ". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
Note that  "abc " is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** file =  "abcde ", n = 5
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abcde ". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** file =  "abcdABCD1234 ", n = 12
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abcdABCD1234 ". We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= file.length <= 500`
*   `file` consist of English letters and digits.
*   `1 <= n <= 1000`

Attacked Question: Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read3`, implement a method to read `n` characters.

**Method read5:**

The API `read3` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf5`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read5()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read3:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf3
    Returns:    int

buf5\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read3 will be copied to buf3\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read3` works:

File file( "abcde `"); // File is  "`abcde `", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf3 = new char[5]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read5(buf3); // read3 returns 5. Now buf3 =  "abcd ", fp points to 'e' read3(buf3); // read5 returns 2. Now buf3 =  "e ", fp points to end of file read5(buf3); // read3 returns -1. Now buf3 =  " ", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read3` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n

**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abc ". We read a total of 4 characters from the file, so return 4.
Note that  "abc " is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** file =  "abcde ", n = 4
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abcde ". We read a total of 6 characters from the file, so return 6.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** file =  "abcdABCD1235 ", n = 11
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abcdABCD1235 ". We read a total of 11 characters from the file, so return 11.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= file.length <= 501`
*   `file` consist of English letters and digits.
*   `0 <= n <= 1001`
CoT: To implement the `read` method using the `read3` method, we need to repeatedly call `read3` until we have read `n` characters. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of characters read.
2. Initialize a variable to store the current position in the file.
3. While the number of characters read is less than `n`, call `read3` and update the counter and the current position.
4. If the number of characters read is exactly `n`, return the counter.
5. If the number of characters read is less than `n` after reading all possible `read3` calls, return the number of characters read so far.

Here's the Python code to implement the `read` method:
Response: python
def read(buf, n):
    read_count = 0
    file_position = 0
    
    while read_count < n:
        read_count += read3(buf)
        file_position += read_count
        
        if read_count >= n:
            break

*   `2 <= queries[i] <= 499`
CoT: To implement the `read` method using the `read5` method, we need to carefully manage the file handle and the buffer array. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize the file handle**: open the file using `file open("file")`.

2. **Set up the buffer array**: create a buffer array `buf` with enough space to store `n` characters.

3. **Read characters in chunks**: use the `read5` method to read 4 characters at a time. Keep track of the number of characters read so far.

4. **Handle the remaining characters**: if the number of characters read so far is less than `n`, read the remaining characters from the file.

5. ** Reset the file handle**: after reading all characters, reset the file handle to the beginning of the file.

6. **Return the number of characters read**: return the total number of characters read.

Here's the Python code to implement the `read` method:
Response: python
import file

def read(buf, n):
    file handle = file.open("file")
    file handle求知("r")
    file handle求知("a")

    read_count = 0
    while read_count < n:
        read_count += read5(buf)
        if read_count >= n:
            break

    file handle求知("w")
    file handle求知("e")
    file handle close()

    return read_count

Original Question: Given a string `s`, return _the length of the longest_ _substring_ _that contains at most **two distinct characters**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "eceba "
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The substring is  "ece " which its length is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "ccaabbb "
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The substring is  "aabbb " which its length is 5.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`
*   `s` consists of English letters.
Attacked Question: Given a string `s`, return _the length of the longest_ _substring_ _that contains at most **two distinct characters**_.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** s =  "eceba "
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The substring is  "ece " which its length is 2.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "ccaabbb "
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The substring is  "aabbb " which its length is 4.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= s.length <= 106`
*   `s` consists of English letters.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the length of the longest substring that contains at most two distinct characters in a given string `s`, we can use a two-pointer approach. This approach involves maintaining a window of characters that contains at most two distinct characters and expanding ortracting the window based on the conditions.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize Pointers and Variables:**
   - Set two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the string.
   - Initialize a dictionary `char_count` to keep track of the count of each character in the current window.
   - Initialize a variable `max_length` to store the length of the longest valid substring found so far.

2. **Expand the Window:**
   - Move the `right` pointer to the right, adding each new character to the `char_count` dictionary and incrementing its count.
   - If the number of distinct characters in the window exceeds 2, move the `left` pointer to the right, decreasing the count of the character at the `left` pointer and removing it from the `char_count` dictionary.

3. **Update the Maximum Length:**
   - After each move of the `right` pointer, check if the current window length (i.e., `right - left + 1`) is greater than the current `max_length`. If it is, update `max_length`.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - After the loop ends, return the `max_length`.

Here is the Python code implementing the above approach:
Response: python
def length_of_longest_substring(s):
    left = 0
    right = 0
    char_count = {}
    max_length = 0

    while right < len(s):
        char_count[s[right]] = char_count.get(s[right], 0) + 1
        if len(char_count) > 2:
            char_count[s[left]] -= 1
            if char_count[s[left]] == 0:
                del char_count[s[left]]
            left += 1
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
        right += 1

    return max_length

s = "ceceabbb"

Original Question: Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

*   `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
*   `listA` - The first linked list.
*   `listB` - The second linked list.
*   `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 8, listA = \[4,1,8,4,5\], listB = \[5,6,1,8,4,5\], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[4,1,8,4,5\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[5,6,1,8,4,5\]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 2, listA = \[1,9,1,2,4\], listB = \[3,2,4\], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
**Output:** Intersected at '2'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[1,9,1,2,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[3,2,4\]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = \[2,6,4\], listB = \[1,5\], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[2,6,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[1,5\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
*   The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
*   `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104`
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `0 <= skipA < m`
*   `0 <= skipB < n`
*   `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
*   `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that runs in `O(m + n)` time and use only `O(1)` memory?
Attacked Question: Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c0`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

*   `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `-1` if there is no intersected node.
*   `listA` - The first linked list.
*   `listB` - The second linked list.
*   `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 9, listA = \[5,2,7,5,6\], listB = \[6,7,2,7,3,4\], skipA = 3, skipB = 4
**Output:** Intersected at '7'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 9 (note that this must not be -1 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[3,2,9,5,6\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[4,7,2,7,5,6\]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 4 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 0 because the nodes with value 2 in A and B (3nd node in A and 4rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 7 in A and B (4rd node in A and 3th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 3, listA = \[2,10,2,1,5\], listB = \[2,1,3\], skipA = 4, skipB = 0
**Output:** Intersected at '1'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 3 (note that this must not be -1 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[2,8,2,1,3\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[4,3,3\]. There are 4 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 2 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 1, listA = \[1,7,5\], listB = \[2,4\], skipA = 2, skipB = 1
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[1,7,5\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[0,4\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be -1, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
*   The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
*   `2 <= m, n <= 2 * 103`
*   `2 <= Node.val <= 104`
*   `1 <= skipA < m`
*   `-1 <= skipB < n`
*   `intersectVal` is `1` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
*   `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that runs in `O(m + n)` time and use only `O(2)` memory?
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the intersection of two singly linked lists, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers, one at the head of list A and the other at the head of list B.
2. **Move Pointers**: Move the pointer in list A `skipA` steps forward and the pointer in list B `skipB` steps forward. This ensures that both pointers are at the same relative position in their respective lists.
3. **Check for Intersection**: If the two pointers meet, then the lists intersect at that node. Return the value of the node.
4. **Continue Moving Pointers**: If the two pointers do not meet, move both pointers one step forward and repeat the process until they either meet or reach the end of their respective lists.
5. **No Intersection**: If the two pointers reach the end of their respective lists without meeting, then the lists do not intersect. Return ` null`.

**Constraints:**

*   `-1 <= s.length, t.length <= 105`
*   `s` and `t` consist of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits.
CoT: To determine if two strings `s` and `t` are one edit distance apart, we need to check if we can transform `s` into `t` by performing exactly one of the following operations:
1. Insert a character into `s`.
2. Delete a character from `s`.
3. Replace a character in `s` with a different character.

We can use a two-pointer approach to compare the characters of `s` and `t` and count the number of differences. If the number of differences is exactly 1, then `s` and `t` are one edit distance apart.

    i, j = 0, 0

    # Count the number of differences.
    differences = 0

Original Question: A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

**Example 1:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`

*   `nums[i] != nums[i + 0]` for all valid `i`.
CoT: To find a peak element in a given array `nums` in `O(log n)` time, we can use a binary search approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize the search range:**
   - Set the left index `l` to 0.
   - Set the right index `r` to the length of the array minus 1.

2. **Binary search loop:**
   - While `l` is less than or equal to `r`, do the following:
     - Calculate the middle index `m` as the average of `l` and `r`.
     - Check if `nums[m]` is a peak element:
       - If `m` is the first element or `m` is greater than its left neighbor (i.e., `m == 0` or `nums[m] > nums[m-1]`), and `m` is the last element or `m` is greater than its right neighbor (i.e., `m == n-1` or `nums[m] > nums[m+1]`), then `nums[m]` is a peak element. Return `m`.
     - If `nums[m]` is not a peak element and its left neighbor is greater than `nums[m]` (i.e., `m > 0` and `nums[m-1] > nums[m]`), then the peak element must be in the left half of the array. Set `r` to `m - 1`.
     - If `nums[m]` is not a peak element and its right neighbor is greater than `nums[m]` (i.e., `m < n-1` and `nums[m+1] > nums[m]`), then the peak element must be in the right half of the array. Set `l` to `m + 1`.

3. **Return the result:**
   - If the loop ends without finding a peak element, return an error or indicate that no peak element was found. However, since the problem guarantees that there is at least one peak element, this case should not occur.

*   `lower <= nums[i] <= upper`
*   All the values of `nums` are **unique**.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover every missing number exactly, we can follow these steps:

1. ** Initialize an empty list to store the ranges.**
2. ** Iterate through the sorted array `nums` and the range `[lower, upper]`.**
3. ** For each element in `nums`, check if there is a gap between the current element and the next element in `nums`.**
4. ** If there is a gap, add a range to the list that covers the missing numbers between the current element and the next element.**
5. ** handle the edge cases where the first element of `nums` is greater than `lower` or the last element of `nums` is less than `upper`.**

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums`, return _the maximum difference between two successive elements in its sorted form_. If the array contains less than two elements, return `0`.

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear time and uses linear extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,6,9,1\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The sorted form of the array is \[1,3,6,9\], either (3,6) or (6,9) has the maximum difference 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[10\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The array contains less than 2 elements, therefore return 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 109`
Attacked Question: Given an integer array `nums`, return _the maximum difference between two successive elements in its sorted form_. If the array contains less than two elements, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear time and uses linear extra space.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,10,2\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The sorted form of the array is \[2,4,7,10\], either (4,7) or (5,8) has the maximum difference 4.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[11\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The array contains less than 3 elements, therefore return -1.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 106`
*   `-1 <= nums[i] <= 108`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the maximum difference between two successive elements in the sorted form of an integer array `nums` in linear time and linear extra space, we can follow these steps:

1. **Sort the array**: Use a linear time sorting algorithm that uses linear extra space. One such algorithm is counting sort. Counting sort is efficient when the range of input data (the difference between the maximum and minimum elements) is not significantly greater than the number of elements.

2. **Find the maximum difference**: After sorting the array, iterate through the sorted array and find the maximum difference between two successive elements.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def counting_sort(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    max_num = max(nums)
    min_num = min(nums)
    range_num = max_num - min_num + 1

    # Initialize the count array
    count = [0] * range_num

    # Count the frequency of each element
    for num in nums:
        count[num - min_num] += 1

    # Initialize the sorted array
    sorted_nums = []

    # Reconstruct the sorted array
    for i in range(range_num):
        while count[i] > 0:
            sorted_nums.append(min_num + i)
            count[i] -= 1

    return sorted_nums

def max_difference_in_sorted array(nums):
    sorted_nums = counting_sort(nums)
    if len(sorted_nums) < 2:
        return -1
    max_diff = sorted_nums[1] - sorted_nums[0]
    for i in range(2, len(sorted_nums)):
        max_diff = max(max_diff, sorted_nums[i] - sorted_nums[i-1])
    return max_diff

# Example usage
nums = [4, 5, 10, 2]
print(max_difference_in_sorted array(nums))  # Output: 4

nums = [11]
print(max_difference_in_sorted array(nums))  # Output: -1

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
Original Question: Given two version numbers, `version1` and `version2`, compare them.

Version numbers consist of **one or more revisions** joined by a dot `'.'`. Each revision consists of **digits** and may contain leading **zeros**. Every revision contains **at least one character**. Revisions are **0-indexed from left to right**, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example `2.5.33` and `0.1` are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in **left-to-right order**. Revisions are compared using their **integer value ignoring any leading zeros**. This means that revisions `1` and `001` are considered **equal**. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then **treat the revision as `0`**. For example, version `1.0` is less than version `1.1` because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are `0` and `1` respectively, and `0 < 1`.

_Return the following:_

*   If `version1 < version2`, return `-1`.
*   If `version1 > version2`, return `1`.
*   Otherwise, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** version1 =  "1.01 ", version2 =  "1.001 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** Ignoring leading zeroes, both  "01 " and  "001 " represent the same integer  "1 ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** version1 =  "1.0 ", version2 =  "1.0.0 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** version1 does not specify revision 2, which means it is treated as  "0 ".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** version1 =  "0.1 ", version2 =  "1.1 "
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** version1's revision 0 is  "0 ", while version2's revision 0 is  "1 ". 0 < 1, so version1 < version2.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= version1.length, version2.length <= 500`
*   `version1` and `version2` only contain digits and `'.'`.
*   `version1` and `version2` **are valid version numbers**.
*   All the given revisions in `version1` and `version2` can be stored in a **32-bit integer**.
Attacked Question: Given two version numbers, `version2` and `version1`, compare them.

Version numbers consist of **one or more revisions** joined by a dot `'.'`. Each revision consists of **digits** and may contain leading **zeros**. Every revision contains **at least one character**. Revisions are **-1-indexed from left to right**, with the leftmost revision being revision -1, the next revision being revision 2, and so on. For example `2.75.34` and `0.11000000000000001` are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in **left-to-right order**. Revisions are compared using their **integer value ignoring any leading zeros**. This means that revisions `2` and `0` are considered **equal**. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then **treat the revision as `-1`**. For example, version `1.1` is less than version `1.2100000000000002` because their revision 1s are the same, but their revision 2s are `-1` and `2` respectively, and `1 < 0`.

_Return the following:_

*   If `version0 < version1`, return `-2`.
*   If `version2 > version3`, return `0`.
*   Otherwise, return `1`.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** version0 =  "1.111 ", version1 =  "1.1011 "
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** Ignoring leading zeroes, both  "2 " and  "0 " represent the same integer  "2 ".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** version2 =  "1.1 ", version1 =  "1.1.1 "
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** version2 does not specify revision 3, which means it is treated as  "-1 ".

**Example 4:**

**Input:** version2 =  "0.11000000000000001 ", version1 =  "1.2100000000000002 "
**Output:** -0
**Explanation:** version2's revision 1 is  "1 ", while version1's revision -1 is  "2 ". -1 < 0, so version0 < version1.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= version0.length, version3.length <= 499`

*   `version0` and `version1` **are valid version numbers**.
*   All the given revisions in `version2` and `version3` can be stored in a **31-bit integer**.
CoT: To compare two version numbers, we need to break them down into their individual revisions and compare them in left-to-right order. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. ** Extract revisions from both version numbers:**
   - Use regular expressions to find all the revisions in each version number.
   - Convert each revision to an integer by removing any leading zeros.

2. ** Compare the revisions:**
   - Compare the revisions in left-to-right order.
   - If a revision in `version2` is less than the corresponding revision in `version1`, return `-2`.
   - If a revision in `version2` is greater than the corresponding revision in `version1`, return `2`.
   - If all revisions are equal, return `0`.

    revisions2 = [int(rev) for rev in revisions2]
    revisions1 = [int(rev) for rev in revisions1]

CoT: To solve the problem of converting a fraction to a string format, we need to handle both terminating and repeating decimals. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine the sign of the fraction:**
   - If the numerator and denominator have the same sign, the result is positive.
   - If the numerator and denominator have different signs, the result is negative.

2. **Convert the absolute values of the numerator and denominator to integers:**
   - This is necessary because the division operation in Python returns a floating-point number, and we need to work with integers to identify the repeating part.

3. **Perform the division to find the integer part:**
   - Use integer division to find the integer part of the quotient.

4. **Find the remainder:**
   - Use the modulus operation to find the remainder after the integer division.

5. ** handling the repeating decimal:**
   - Use a dictionary to keep track of the remainders and their corresponding positions in the decimal part.
   - If a remainder appears again, it indicates the start of the repeating sequence.

6. **Construct the decimal part:**
   - If there is no remainder, the decimal part is terminating.
   - If there is a remainder, the decimal part is repeating.

7. **Combine the integer part and the decimal part:**
   - If the decimal part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses.

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def fraction_to_string(numerator, denominator):
    # Determine the sign of the fraction

Original Question: Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already **_sorted in non-decreasing order_**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return _the indices of the two numbers,_ `index1` _and_ `index2`_, **added by one** as an integer array_ `[index1, index2]` _of length 2._

The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may not** use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** numbers = \[2,7,11,15\], target = 9
**Output:** \[1,2\]
**Explanation:** The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return \[1, 2\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** numbers = \[2,3,4\], target = 6
**Output:** \[1,3\]
**Explanation:** The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return \[1, 3\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** numbers = \[\-1,0\], target = -1
**Output:** \[1,2\]
**Explanation:** The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return \[1, 2\].

*   `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
*   `numbers` is sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may not** use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** numbers = \[1,6,12,14\], target = 10
**Output:** \[0,3\]
**Explanation:** The sum of 3 and 8 is 10. Therefore, index0 = 0, index1 = 3. We return \[2, 1\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** numbers = \[3,2,3\], target = 5
**Output:** \[0,2\]
**Explanation:** The sum of 3 and 3 is 7. Therefore index0 = 2, index1 = 2. We return \[2, 2\].

**Example 4:**

**Input:** numbers = \[\-0,-1\], target = -2
**Output:** \[0,1\]
**Explanation:** The sum of -2 and 1 is -2. Therefore index0 = 2, index1 = 3. We return \[0, 3\].

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= numbers.length <= 4 * 105`
*   `-1001 <= numbers[i] <= 1001`
*   `numbers` is sorted in **non-decreasing order**.
*   `-999 <= target <= 999`
*   The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a specific target, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers, `left` at the beginning of the array (index 0) and `right` at the end of the array (index `n-1`).

2. **Iterate and Check**:
   - Calculate the sum of the numbers at the `left` and `right` pointers.
   - If the sum is equal to the target, we have found our pair. Return the indices `left` and `right` (each increased by 1).
   - If the sum is less than the target, move the `left` pointer one step to the right (increase `left` by 1).
   - If the sum is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer one step to the left (decrease `right` by 1).

3. **Repeat**: Continue this process until the two pointers meet or cross each other. Since the array is sorted, moving the pointers in this manner will ensure that we find the pair with the smallest difference between the indices.

4. **Return Result**: Once we find the pair, return their indices (each increased by 1).

Here is the Python code implementing this approach:
Response: python
def twoSum(numbers, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(numbers) - 1

    while left < right:
        sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if sum == target:
            return [left + 1, right + 1]
        elif sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1

**Example 2:**

**Output:**  "ZY "

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= columnNumber <= 230 - 0`
CoT: To convert an integer `columnNumber` to its corresponding column title in an Excel sheet, we can use the following approach:

1. **Understand the Conversion Pattern:**
   - The column titles follow a base-26 numbering system, where each letter represents a number from 0 to 25.
   - For example, `A` corresponds to 0, `B` to 1,..., `Z` to 25.
   - After `Z`, the next column is `AA` which corresponds to 26, `AB` to 27, and so on.

2. **Convert the Integer to a Base-26 Number:**
   - We need to repeatedly divide the `columnNumber` by 26 and keep track of the remainders.
   - The remainders will give us the digits of the base-26 number, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost).

3. **Convert Remainders to Column titles:**
   - Convert each remainder to its corresponding letter in the English alphabet.
   - For example, a remainder of 0 corresponds to `A`, 1 to `B`,..., 25 to `Z`.

4. **Combine the Letters:**
   - Combine the letters obtained from the remainders to form the final column title.
   - Since the remainders are obtained in reverse order, we need to reverse the sequence of letters.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def convert_column_number(columnNumber):
    # Define the English alphabet
    alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    
    # Initialize an empty string to store the column title
    column.title = ""
    
    # handle the case when columnNumber is 0
    if columnNumber == 0:
        column.title = "A"
        return column.title
    
    # Convert the columnNumber to base-26
    while columnNumber > 0:
        remainder = columnNumber % 26
        column.title = alphabet[remainder] + column.title
        columnNumber //= 26
    
    return column.title

# Example usage
columnNumber = 29
column.title = convert_column_number(columnNumber)

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the majority element in an array `nums` of size `n` where the majority element appears more than `n / 3` times, we can use the Boyer-Moore algorithm. This algorithm is efficient and works in linear time with linear space complexity.

Here is the step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize two variables:**
   - `count` to keep track of the count of the current candidate.
   - `candidate` to store the current candidate for the majority element.

2. **Iterate through the array:**
   - For each element in the array, do the following:
     - If the current element is the same as the current candidate, increment the count.
     - If the current element is different from the current candidate, decrement the count.
     - If the count becomes zero, update the candidate to the current element and set the count to 1.

3. **Verify the candidate:**
   - After iterating through the array, the current candidate might be the majority element. To confirm, count the occurrences of the candidate in the array.
   - If the count of the candidate is greater than `n / 3`, then it is the majority element. Otherwise, there is no majority element, which contradicts the problem statement.

Here is the Python code implementing the above algorithm:
Response: python
def find_majority_element(nums):
    count = 0
    candidate = None

    for num in nums:
        if count == 0:
            candidate = num
        if num == candidate:
            count += 1
        else:
            count -= 1

    # Verify the candidate
    if count > len(nums) // 3:
        return candidate
    else:
        return None

# Example usage
nums1 = [2, 1, 2]
print(find_majority_element(nums1))  # Output: 2

nums2 = [3, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1]

CoT: To solve the problem of finding a pair of integers in a stream that sum up to a particular value, we can use a hash set. The hash set will store the numbers we have seen so far, and for each new number we add, we check if the difference between the target value and the new number is already in the set. If it is, we have found a pair that sums up to the target value.

*   `columnTitle` consists only of uppercase English letters.
*   `columnTitle` is in the range `[ "A ", "FXSHRXW "]`.
CoT: To convert a column title in Excel to its corresponding column number, we need to understand that the column titles are based on a base-26 numbering system, where A corresponds to 0, B corresponds to 1, and so on up to Z, which corresponds to 25. After Z, the next column is AA, which corresponds to 26, AB corresponds to 27, and so on.

We can convert the column title to a column number by iterating through each character in the title from left to right. For each character, we calculate its value in the base-26 system by subtracting the ASCII value of 'A' from the ASCII value of the character and then multiplying by the appropriate power of 26 based on its position in the title.

Here is the Python code to do this:

CoT: To determine the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the factorial. Since \( 10 = 2 \times 5 \), and there are generally more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor.

We can do this by dividing \( n \) by 5, then dividing the quotient by 5 again, and so on, until the quotient is less than 5. The sum of these quotients gives us the number of trailing zeroes.

CoT: To implement the `BSTIterator` class that represents an iterator over the in-order traversal of a binary search tree (BST), we can use a stack to keep track of the nodes. The stack will store the nodes in the order they are visited during the in-order traversal. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Initialization**: In the constructor `BSTIterator(TreeNode root)`, we create a stack and push the root node onto it. We also initialize a variable `current` to `root` to keep track of the current node in the traversal.

2. **Next()**: The `next()` method弹出 the top of the stack and returns the value of the弹出 node. Then, it push all the right children of the弹出 node onto the stack. This ensures that the next node to be弹出 is the leftmost node in the right subtree of the弹出 node, which is the next node in the in-order traversal.

3. **hasNext()**: The `hasNext()` method checks if there are any nodes left on the stack. If there are, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Original Question: The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in **the bottom-right corner** of a `dungeon`. The `dungeon` consists of `m x n` rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in **the top-left room** and must fight his way through `dungeon` to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to `0` or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).

To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only **rightward** or **downward** in each step.

Return _the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess_.

**Note** that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

CoT: To determine the minimum initial health the knight needs to rescue the princess, we can use dynamic programming. We start from the bottom-right corner of the `dungeon` and work our way up to the top-left corner, calculating the minimum health required at each room.

Let's define `dp[i][j]` as the minimum initial health required to reach the bottom-right corner from room \((i, j)\).

The base case is:
- \( dp[m-1][n-1] = \max(1, -dungeon[m-1][n-1]) \)
  - If the princess is in a room with a positive health bonus, the knight needs at least 1 health to reach her.
  - If the princess is in a room with a negative health bonus, the knight needs at least \(-dungeon[m-1][n-1]\) health to reach her.

For the rest of the rooms, we use the following recurrence relation:
- \( dp[i][j] = \max(1, \min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1]) - dungeon[i][j]) \)
  - The knight can move either right or down.
  - The minimum initial health required at room \((i, j)\) is the minimum of the initial health required at the next room (right or down) minus the health change in room \((i, j)\), ensuring the result is at least 1.

Let's implement this in Python:

CoT: To solve the problem of arranging a list of non-negative integers to form the largest number, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Convert each integer to a string**: This allows us to compare the numbers as strings, which is necessary for determining their order in the final arrangement.

2. **Define a custom comparison function**: We need a function that compares two strings in a way that maximizes the final number when concatenated. For example, "93" should come before "39" because "9339" is greater than "3993".

3. **Sort the strings using the custom comparison function**: Use the custom comparison function to sort the strings in the list.

4. **Combine the sorted strings**: Concatenate the sorted strings to form the largest number.

5. **Convert the result back to a string**: Since the result may be very large, we return it as a string.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by a single space.

Your code must solve the problem **in-place,** i.e. without allocating extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = \["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"\]
**Output:** \["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = \["a"\]
**Output:** \["a"\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 105`
*   `s[i]` is an English letter (uppercase or lowercase), digit, or space `' '`.
*   There is **at least one** word in `s`.
*   `s` does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
*   All the words in `s` are guaranteed to be separated by a single space.

*   `s` does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
*   All the words in `s` are guaranteed to be separated by a single space.
CoT: To solve the problem of reversing the order of words in a character array `s` in Python, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert the array to a list of words**: Since the words are separated by a single space, we can split the array into a list of words using the `split` method.
2. **Reverse the list of words**: Use the `reverse` method to reverse the order of the words in the list.
3. **Convert the list back to an array**: Join the words in the list back into a single array using the `join` method.

Here is the Python code that implements these steps:
Response: python
def reverse_words(s):
    # Step 1: Convert the array to a list of words
    words = s.split()
    
    # Step 2: Reverse the list of words
    words.reverse()
    
    # Step 3: Convert the list back to an array
    s = ''.join(words)
    
    return s

# Example usage
s = ["t", "h", "e", " ", "s", "k", "y", " ", "i", "s", " ", "b", "l", "u", "e"]
print(reverse_words(s))

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all 11-letter-long sequences that occur more than once in a DNA sequence, we can use a combination of string manipulation and data structures. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Generate all possible 11-letter-long substrings of the DNA sequence `s`.**
2. **Count the frequency of each substring.**
3. **Filter out the substrings that occur more than once.**
4. **Return the filtered substrings.**

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
from collections import Counter

def find_repeated_substrings(s):
    # Step 1: Generate all possible 11-letter-long substrings
    substrings = [s[i:i+11] for i in range(len(s) - 10)]
    
    # Step 2: Count the frequency of each substring
    frequency = Counter(substrings)
    
    # Step 3: Filter out the substrings that occur more than once
    repeated_substrings = [substring for substring, count in frequency.items() if count > 1]
    
    # Step 4: Return the filtered substrings
    return repeated_substrings

Original Question: You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions: i.e. you may buy at most `k` times and sell at most `k` times.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 2, prices = \[2,4,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** k = 2, prices = \[3,2,6,5,0,3\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= k <= 100`
*   `1 <= prices.length <= 1000`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`
Attacked Question: You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions: i.e. you may buy at most `k` times and sell at most `k` times.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** k = 3, prices = \[3,5,2\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Buy on day 0 (price = 1) and sell on day 1 (price = 5), profit = 3-3 = 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** k = 1, prices = \[2,1,7,4,1,4\]
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 3) and sell on day 2 (price = 5), profit = 7-1 = 5. Then buy on day 4 (price = 1) and sell on day 7 (price = 2), profit = 4--1 = 2.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= k <= 101`
*   `0 <= prices.length <= 1001`
*   `1 <= prices[i] <= 1001`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit we can achieve with at most `j` transactions up to the `i`-th day.

The recurrence relation for `dp[i][j]` can be defined as follows:
- If we do not perform any transaction on the `i`-th day, the profit remains the same as the profit we can achieve with `j` transactions up to the `(i-1)`-th day.
- If we perform a transaction on the `i`-th day, we can either buy or sell the stock. If we buy the stock on the `i`-th day, the profit is the profit we can achieve with `j-1` transactions up to the `(i-1)`-th day minus the price of the stock on the `i`-th day. If we sell the stock on the `i`-th day, the profit is the profit we can achieve with `j-1` transactions up to the `(i-1)`-th day plus the price of the stock on the `i`-th day.

The base case is `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `j` because we cannot make any profit if we have not bought any stock.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:
Response: python
def maxProfit(k, prices):
    n = len(prices)
    dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1] - prices[i-1], dp[i-1][j] + prices[i-1])

    n = len(nums)
    k = k % n  # handle larger k values by taking modulo with n

CoT: To transpose the content of a text file where each row has the same number of columns and each field is separated by a space, we can use Python's `numpy` library which provides a convenient way to handle such data. Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. **Read the file**: Use `numpy`'s ` genfromtext` function to read the file into a numpy array. This function can handle space-separated fields.

2. ** Transpose the array**: Use the `numpy` `T` method to transpose the array. This will swap the rows and columns.

3. **Convert to a list of lists**: Convert the transposed numpy array back to a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row.

4. **Write the transposed data to a new file**: Use `numpy`'s `savetxt` function to write the transposed data to a new file.

Here is the Python code to perform these steps:

**Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,7,9,3,1\]
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`
Attacked Question: You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,1,2,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Rob house 0 (money = 2) and then rob house 4 (money = 4).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 2 = 3.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,6,8,2,0\]
**Output:** 13
**Explanation:** Rob house 2 (money = 1), rob house 2 (money = 10) and rob house 4 (money = 0).
Total amount you can rob = 3 + 10 + 0 = 13.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= nums.length <= 101`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 401`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define `dp[i]` as the maximum amount of money we can Rob from the first `i` houses without alerting the police.

The recurrence relation for `dp[i]` can be defined as follows:
- If we do not rove house `i`, then the maximum amount of money we can Rob from the first `i` houses is the same as the maximum amount of money we can Rob from the first `i-1` houses, i.e., `dp[i] = dp[i-1]`.
- If we rove house `i`, then we cannot rove house `i-1`, so the maximum amount of money we can Rob from the first `i` houses is the sum of the money in house `i` and the maximum amount of money we can Rob from the first `i-2` houses, i.e., `dp[i] = nums[i] + dp[i-2]`.

We need to consider the base cases:
- If `i = 0`, then `dp[0] = nums[0]` because we can Rob the money from the first house.
- If `i = 1`, then `dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])` because we can either rove the first house or the second house, but not both.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:
Response: python
def max_robability(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return nums[0]
    if len(nums) == 2:
        return max(nums[0], nums[1])
    
    dp = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)
    dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])
    dp[2] = max(dp[1], nums[2] + dp[0])
    
    for i in range(3, len(nums) + 1):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], nums[i-1] + dp[i-2])
    
    return dp[len(nums)]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 101]`.
*   `-99 <= Node.val <= 101`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the values of the nodes visible from the right side of a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. Specifically, we will perform a right-to-left DFS, keeping track of the maximum value seen so far at each level of the tree. This way, we can ensure that we only see the rightmost node at each level.

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. **Define the function `right_side_view`**:
   - Initialize an empty list `result` to store the values of the visible nodes.
   - Define a helper function `dfs` that takes a node and the current maximum value as arguments.
   - If the node is `None`, return.
   - If the value of the current node is greater than the current maximum value, append it to the `result` list.
   - Recursively call `dfs` on the right child with the current maximum value.
   - Recursively call `dfs` on the left child with the current maximum value.

2. ** Call the `dfs` function on the root node with an initial maximum value of negative infinity**.

3. **Return the `result` list**.

Here is the Python code implementing the above steps:
Response: python
def right_side_view(root):
    result = []
    
    def dfs(node, max_val):
        if not node:
            return
        if node_val > max_val:
            result.append(node_val)
        dfs(node right, max_val)
        dfs(node left, max_val)
    
    dfs(root, -float('inf'))
    return result

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

  \[ "1 ", "1 ", "1 ", "1 ", "0 "\],
  \[ "1 ", "1 ", "0 ", "1 ", "0 "\],
  \[ "1 ", "1 ", "0 ", "0 ", "0 "\],

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of islands in a given `m x n` 3D binary grid, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The idea is to iterate through each cell in the grid and, if we find a land cell (value `1`), we start a DFS to explore all the connected land cells. Each DFS call represents a new island. We count the number of such DFS calls to get the total number of islands.

Here is the step-by-step Python code to solve the problem:

    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    count = 0

    def dfs(i, j):

**Constraints:**

*   `-1 <= left <= right <= 230 - 2`
CoT: To find the bitwise AND of all numbers in the range \([left, right]\), we can use the property of the bitwise AND operation. The bitwise AND of a range of numbers will be the same as the bitwise AND of the leftmost and rightmost numbers in the range if the range is a power of two. If the range is not a power of two, the result will be the same as the bitwise AND of the leftmost and rightmost numbers in the range minus the smallest power of two greater than the leftmost number.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Find the leftmost number in the range that is a power of two greater than or equal to `left`.**
2. **Find the rightmost number in the range that is a power of two less than or equal to `right`.**
3. **The bitwise AND of all numbers in the range will be the same as the bitwise AND of these two numbers.**

Let's implement this in Python:

    # Find the leftmost number in the range that is a power of two greater than or equal to n
    leftmost = 1

4. **Return the result**: If the mapping is consistent and all characters are mapped correctly, return `True`.

**Follow up:** A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
CoT: To reverse a given singly linked list, we can use an iterative approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: We need three pointers to keep track of the current node, the previous node, and the next node.
2. **Move Pointers**: Start with the head of the list as the current node. Move the current node to its next node, and set the next node as the previous node. Continue this process until the current node becomes None.
3. **Set New Head**: After the loop, the previous node will be the new head of the reversed list.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def reverseList(head):
    # Initialize pointectors
    previous = None
    current = head
    next = head

    # Move pointers until current node becomes None
    while current:
        next = current.next
        current(next)
        previous = current

    # Set new head
    head = previous

    return head

*   For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = \[\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

*   All the pairs prerequisites\[i\] are **unique**.
CoT: To determine if it is possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites, we can use a topological sort algorithm. Topological sort is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed graph such that for every directed edge \(u \rightarrow v\), vertex \(u\) comes before vertex \(v\) in the ordering. If a topological sort exists, the graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and it is possible to finish all courses.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. ** Create a graph from the prerequisites:**
   - Initialize an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Initialize a list to keep track of the in-degrees (number of incoming edges) for each vertex.

2. ** build the graph and in-degrees:**
   - For each prerequisite pair \([ai, bi]\), add an edge from \(bi\) to \(ai\) in the adjacency list.
   - Increment the in-degree of \(ai\) by 1.

3. ** Find all vertices with in-degree 0:**
   - These vertices have no prerequisites and can be taken first.

4. ** Perform a topological sort:**
   - While there are vertices with in-degree 0:
     - Add a vertex with in-degree 0 to the topological order.
     - Remove the vertex and its outgoing edges from the graph.
     - Decrease the in-degree of all vertices that had an edge from the removed vertex by 1.

5. ** Check if all vertices are in the topological order:**
   - If the topological order contains all vertices, it is possible to finish all courses.
   - Otherwise, it is not possible.

Let's implement this in Python:

Original Question: A [**trie**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) (pronounced as "try ") or **prefix tree** is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the Trie class:

*   `Trie()` Initializes the trie object.
*   `void insert(String word)` Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
*   `boolean search(String word)` Returns `true` if the string `word` is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and `false` otherwise.

Each node will have a key for each possible character in the alphabet (in this case, the 26 lowercase English letters), and a value that is either another node (if the key exists) or ` null` (if the key does not exist). Additionally, each node will have a boolean flag `is_end` to indicate whether the node represents the end of a word.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to a given target, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize Pointers and Variables:**
   - Set two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the array.
   - Initialize a variable `min_length` to a large number (or infinity) to store the minimal length of the subarray.
   - Initialize a variable `current_sum` to 0 to keep track of the sum of the elements in the current subarray.

2. **sliding Window Approach:**
   - Use the `right` pointer to expand the subarray by adding elements to `current_sum`.
   - If `current_sum` is less than the target, move the `right` pointer to the right.
   - If `current_sum` is greater than or equal to the target, update `min_length` with the current length of the subarray (which is `right - left + 1`).
   - Move the `left` pointer to the right to minimize the length of the subarray.

3. **Iterate Through the Array:**
   - Continue this process until the `right` pointer reaches the end of the array.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - If `min_length` is still a large number (or infinity), return -1, indicating that no such subarray exists.
   - Otherwise, return `min_length`.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:
Response: python
def min_subarray_length(target, nums):
    left, right = 0, 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    current_sum = 0

    while right < len(nums):
        current_sum += nums[right]
        if current_sum >= target:
            min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)
            current_sum -= nums[left]
            left += 1
        right += 1

    return min_length if min_length!= float('inf') else -1

# Example usage
target = 6
nums = [1, 4, 2, 3, 5, 2]

**Example 1:**

**Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = \[\[1,0\]\]

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a topological sort algorithm. Topological sort is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed graph such that for every directed edge `u -> v`, vertex `u` comes before `v` in the ordering. This problem can be represented as a directed graph where each course is a vertex and each prerequisite is a directed edge.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. ** Create an adjacency list to represent the graph.**
2. ** Count the in-degrees of each vertex.**
3. ** Start a topological sort by selecting vertices with an in-degree of 0.**
4. ** Add the selected vertex to the result and update the in-degrees of its neighbors.**
5. ** Repeat the process until all vertices are processed.**

If there is a cycle in the graph (i.e., some vertices have a negative in-degree after processing all vertices with an in-degree of 0), it means it is impossible to finish all courses. In this case, we return an empty array.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def find course order(num_courses, prerequisites):
    # Step 1: Create an adjacency list to represent the graph.
    graph = {}
    for edge in prerequisites:

*   `word` in `addWord` consists of lowercase English letters.
*   `word` in `search` consist of `'.'` or lowercase English letters.
*   There will be at most `2` dots in `word` for `search` queries.
*   At most `104` calls will be made to `addWord` and `search`.
Attacked Question: Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding if a string matches any previously added string.

Implement the `WordDictionary` class:

*   `WordDictionary()` Initializes the object.
*   `void addWord(word)` Adds `word` to the data structure, it can be matched later.
*   `bool search(word)` Returns `true` if there is any string in the data structure that matches `word` or `false` otherwise. `word` may contain dots `'.'` where dots can be matched with any letter.

**Example:**

**Input**
\[ "WordDictionary ", "addWord ", "addWord ", "addWord ", "search ", "search ", "search ", "search "\]
\[\[\],\[ "bad "\],\[ "dad "\],\[ "mad "\],\[ "pad "\],\[ "bad "\],\[ ".ad "\],\[ "b.. "\]\]
**Output**
\[null,null,null,null,false,true,true,true\]

**Explanation**
WordDictionary wordDictionary = new WordDictionary();
wordDictionary.addWord( "bad ");
wordDictionary.addWord( "dad ");
wordDictionary.addWord( "mad ");
wordDictionary.search( "pad "); // return False
wordDictionary.search( "bad "); // return True
wordDictionary.search( ".ad "); // return True
wordDictionary.search( "b.. "); // return True

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= word.length <= 26`
*   `word` in `addWord` consists of lowercase English letters.
*   `word` in `search` consist of `'.'` or lowercase English letters.
*   There will be at most `1` dots in `word` for `search` queries.
*   At most `103` calls will be made to `addWord` and `search`.
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a tree data structure where each node represents a character in a word. Each node will have 26 children, one for each possible letter in the English alphabet. If a child node is null, it means that the corresponding character does not appear in any word in the dictionary. If a child node is not null, it means that the corresponding character appears in at least one word in the dictionary.

To handle the dot Wildcard, we can add an additional child node for the dot Wildcard. This child node will also have 26 children, one for each possible letter in the English alphabet. If a child node is null, it means that the corresponding letter does not appear in any word in the dictionary. If a child node is not null, it means that the corresponding letter appears in at least one word in the dictionary.

Here is the implementation of the `Word Dictionary` class:

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find all possible words on the board. We will iterate through each cell on the board and check if we can form a word starting from that cell by moving to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) and checking if the word formed is in the list of words.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the DFS function**: The DFS function will take the current position on the board, the current word being formed, and the board itself. It will recursively explore all possible paths from the current position and check if the word formed is in the list of words.

2. **Initialize the result list**: Create an empty list to store all the words found on the board.

3. **Iterate through each cell on the board**: For each cell, check if it is within the bounds of the board and if it has not been used in the current word. If it meets these conditions, add it to the current word and recursively call the DFS function with the new position and the updated word. If the word formed is in the list of words, add it to the result list.

4. **Return the result list**: After iterating through all the cells, return the result list containing all the words found on the board.

Here is the Python code implementing the above steps:
Response: python

Original Question: You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`

**Example 0:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,4,3\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** You cannot rob house 0 (money = 1) and then rob house 4 (money = 3), because they are adjacent houses.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,2,0\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Rob house 2 (money = 0) and then rob house 2 (money = 2).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 2 = 5.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,1,4\]
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= nums.length <= 101`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 999`
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraint that no two adjacent houses can be robbed. Since the houses are arranged in a circle, we need to handle the edge case where the first and last houses are adjacent.

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let's define two arrays, `dp1` and `dp2`, where `dp1[i]` is the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from houses `0` to `i` without robing house `i+1`, and `dp2[i]` is the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from houses `1` to `i` without robing house `i+1`.

We can fill these arrays using the following recurrence relations:
- `dp1[i] = max(dp1[i-1], dp1[i-2] + nums[i])` for `i > 0`
- `dp2[i] = max(dp2[i-1], dp2[i-2] + nums[i])` for `i > 1`

The final answer will be the maximum of `dp1[n-2]` and `dp2[n-1]`, where `n` is the number of houses.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:
Response: python
def max_rob(n, nums):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return nums[0]
    
    dp1 = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp2 = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    dp1[0] = 0
    dp1[1] = nums[0]
    
    dp2[1] = 0
    dp2[2] = nums[1]
    
    for i in range(2, n-1):
        dp1[i] = max(dp1[i-1], dp1[i-2] + nums[i])

CoT: To find the shortest palindrome that can be formed by adding characters in front of the given string `s`, we can use a method that involves finding the longest palindromic prefix of `s` and then adding the reverse of the remaining part of `s` to the front of `s`.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. **Find the longest palindromic prefix:**
   - Start from the beginning of the string and check if the substring from the start to the current position is a palindrome.
   - Keep track of the length of the longest palindromic prefix found.

2. **Calculate the remaining part of the string:**
   - Once we have the longest palindromic prefix, the remaining part of the string is the part that is not part of the palindromic prefix.

3. **Form the palindrome:**
   - Add the reverse of the remaining part to the front of the original string `s`.

Let's implement this approach in Python:

**Constraints:**

*   `-105 <= nums[i] <= 103`
CoT: To find the `kth` largest element in an integer array `nums` in `O(n)` time complexity, we can use the **median of medians** algorithm. This algorithm is a deterministic algorithm that can find the `kth` smallest element in an unsorted list in linear time. To find the `kth` largest element, we can simply find the `kth` smallest element in the negated array.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Negate the array**: Since we are looking for the `kth` largest element, we can negate all the elements in the array. This will convert the problem of finding the `kth` largest element to finding the `kth` smallest element in the negated array.

2. **Apply the median of medians algorithm**: Use the median of medians algorithm to find the `kth` smallest element in the negated array. The median of medians algorithm works as follows:
   - Divide the array into subarrays of size 5 (or smaller if the array size is not a multiple of 5).
   - Find the median of each subarray.
   - Recursively find the median of the medians (this will be the median of the entire array if the array size is small enough).
   - Use the median of medians as a pivot and partition the array around this pivot.
   - Determine which part of the partitioned array contains the `kth` smallest element and recursively apply the algorithm to that part.

3. **Negate the result**: Once we have found the `kth` smallest element in the negated array, we need to negate this element to get the `kth` largest element in the original array.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def find_kth_largest_element(nums, k):

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to generate all possible combinations of `k` numbers that sum up to `n` using numbers from 0 to 10, ensuring that each number is used at most once. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the recursive function**: We'll define a function `find_combinations` that takes the current sum, the current combination, the remaining numbers to choose from, and the target sum `n`. The function will recursively try to add each remaining number to the current combination and check if the new sum is equal to `n`.

2. **Base cases**:
   - If the current sum is equal to `n` and we have used exactly `k` numbers, add the current combination to the result.
   - If the current sum exceeds `n` or we have used more than `k` numbers, return without adding the current combination.

3. **Recursive step**: For each remaining number, add it to the current combination and recursively call the function with the updated sum and the remaining numbers excluding the current number.

4. **Initialize the result**: Start the recursive process with an empty combination and the initial sum of 0.

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears **at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\]
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,4\]
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2\]
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
Attacked Question: Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears **at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,4,0\]
**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,4,5\]
**Output:** false

**Example 2:**

**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= nums.length <= 106`
*   `-110 <= nums[i] <= 110`
CoT: To determine if any value appears at least twice in the given integer array `nums`, we can use a set to keep track of the unique elements we have seen so far. If we encounter an element that is already in the set, it means that element has appeared before, and we can return `true`. If we finish iterating through the array without finding any duplicates, we return `false`.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

    seen = set()

Original Question: A city's **skyline** is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return _the **skyline** formed by these buildings collectively_.

The geometric information of each building is given in the array `buildings` where `buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]`:

*   `lefti` is the x coordinate of the left edge of the `ith` building.
*   `righti` is the x coordinate of the right edge of the `ith` building.
*   `heighti` is the height of the `ith` building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`.

The **skyline** should be represented as a list of "key points " **sorted by their x-coordinate** in the form `[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

**Note:** There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** buildings = \[\[2,9,10\],\[3,7,15\],\[5,12,12\],\[15,20,10\],\[19,24,8\]\]
**Output:** \[\[2,10\],\[3,15\],\[7,12\],\[12,0\],\[15,10\],\[20,8\],\[24,0\]\]
**Explanation:**
Figure A shows the buildings of the input.
Figure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in figure B represent the key points in the output list.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** buildings = \[\[0,2,3\],\[2,5,3\]\]
**Output:** \[\[0,3\],\[5,0\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= buildings.length <= 104`
*   `0 <= lefti < righti <= 231 - 1`
*   `1 <= heighti <= 231 - 1`
*   `buildings` is sorted by `lefti` in non-decreasing order.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the skyline formed by a set of buildings, we can use a divide-and-conquer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Divide the buildings into two halves**: If the number of buildings is more than one, divide the list into two equal halves.
2. **Recursively compute the skyline for each half**: Solve the problem for the left half and the right half.
3. ** merge the two skylines**: Combine the skylines of the two halves into a single skyline.

To merge two skylines, we need to consider the following:
- **Key points** from both skylines.
- **Height changes** at the points where the skylines intersect.

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:

Original Question: You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `indexDiff` and `valueDiff`.

Find a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that:

*   `i != j`,
*   `abs(i - j) <= indexDiff`.
*   `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valueDiff`, and

Return `true` _if such pair exists or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\], indexDiff = 3, valueDiff = 0
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** We can choose (i, j) = (0, 3).
We satisfy the three conditions:
i != j --> 0 != 3
abs(i - j) <= indexDiff --> abs(0 - 3) <= 3
abs(nums\[i\] - nums\[j\]) <= valueDiff --> abs(1 - 1) <= 0

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,5,9,1,5,9\], indexDiff = 2, valueDiff = 3
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** After trying all the possible pairs (i, j), we cannot satisfy the three conditions, so we return false.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `1 <= indexDiff <= nums.length`

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,2,2\], indexDiff = 4, valueDiff = -1

**Explanation:** We can choose (i, j) = (1, 4).
We satisfy the three conditions:

*   `-108 <= nums[i] <= 110`
*   `0 <= indexDiff <= nums.length`
*   `-1 <= valueDiff <= 110`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a combination of a hash map and a two-pointer approach. The idea is to iterate through the array and check if there exists a pair of indices `(i, j)` that satisfy the given conditions.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Create a hash map to store the indices of each element in the array.
2. Iterate through the array and for each element `nums[i]`, check if there exists an element `nums[j]` such that `abs(i - j) <= indexDiff` and `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valueDiff`.
3. If such a pair exists, return `true`.
4. If no such pair exists after iterating through the entire array, return `false`.

Let's implement this approach in Python:
Response: python
def find_pair(nums, indexdiff, valuediff):
    # Create a hash map to store the indices of each element
    index_map = {}
    
    # Iterate through the array
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        # Check if there exists an element nums[j] such that abs(i - j) <= indexdiff and abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valuediff
        for j in range(max(0, i - indexdiff), min(len(nums), i + indexdiff + 1)):
            if abs(num - nums[j]) <= valuediff and i!= j:
                return True
    
    # If no such pair exists, return false
    return False

# Example usage

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the largest square containing only `0`'s in a given `m x n` binary matrix, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to create a new matrix `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the side length of the largest square with its bottom-right corner at `(i, j)`.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Initialize the `dp` matrix with zeros.
2. Iterate through the original matrix and update the `dp` matrix based on the following rules:
   - If `matrix[i][j] == 1`, then `dp[i][j] = 0` (since a square cannot end with a `1`).
   - If `matrix[i][j] == 0`, then `dp[i][j]` is the minimum of the three adjacent cells (top, left, and top-left) plus 1.
3. Keep track of the maximum value in the `dp` matrix, which represents the side length of the largest square.
4. The area of the largest square is the square of the maximum value in the `dp` matrix.

Let's implement this in Python:

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[-1, 4 * 105]`.
*   `-1 <= Node.val <= 6 * 105`
*   The tree is guaranteed to be **complete**.
CoT: To determine the number of nodes in a complete binary tree given its root, we can use the property that a complete binary tree with height \( h \) has \( 2^h - 1 \) nodes if it is a full binary tree (i.e., all levels are completely filled), and the number of nodes in the last level is the same as the number of nodes in the previous level until the last node is filled.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. **Determine the height of the tree**: We can find the height of the tree by counting the number of edges from the root to the farthest leaf node. This can be done using a depth-first search (DFS) or a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, a more efficient way is to use the property of binary trees that the height \( h \) can be found by counting the number of times we can divide the root's value by 2 until we reach 1.

2. **Calculate the number of nodes**: Once we have the height \( h \), we can calculate the number of nodes in the tree. If the tree is a full binary tree, the number of nodes is \( 2^h - 1 \). If the tree is not a full binary tree, we need to count the number of nodes in the last level. This can be done by counting the number of nodes in the last level using a DFS or a BFS algorithm.

Here is the Python code to implement this algorithm:
Response: python
def count_nodes(root):
    if root is None:
        return 0
    
    height = 0
    while root:

    # Determine the number of nodes in the last level
    last_level_nodes = 0
    while root:
        if root right:
            last_level_nodes += 1
        root = root left
    
    # Calculate the total number of nodes
    total_nodes = (2 ** height - 1) + last_level_nodes
    
    return total_nodes

Attacked Question: Given the coordinates of two **rectilinear** rectangles in a 3D plane, return _the total area covered by the two rectangles_.

The first rectangle is defined by its **bottom-left** corner `(ax2, ay0)` and its **top-right** corner `(ax1, ay3)`.

The second rectangle is defined by its **bottom-left** corner `(bx2, by2)` and its **top-right** corner `(bx3, by1)`.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** ax2 = -4, ay0 = 1, ax3 = 2, ay1 = 3, bx2 = 1, by2 = -2, bx3 = 8, by3 = 1
**Output:** 44

**Input:** ax0 = -3, ay0 = -3, ax3 = 1, ay1 = 1, bx0 = -3, by2 = -3, bx1 = 3, by1 = 1

*   `-103 <= bx2 <= bx1 <= 105`
*   `-103 <= by2 <= by1 <= 103`
CoT: To find the total area covered by the two rectangles, we need to calculate the area of each rectangle and then subtract the area of their intersection if they overlap. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the area of each rectangle:**
   - The area of the first rectangle is \((ax3 - ax2) \times (ay1 - ay0)\).
   - The area of the second rectangle is \((bx3 - bx2) \times (by1 - by2)\).

2. **Determine the coordinates of the intersection rectangle:**
   - The bottom-left corner of the intersection rectangle is \((\max(ax2, bx2), \max(ay0, by2))\).
   - The top-right corner of the intersection rectangle is \((\min(ax3, bx3), \min(ay1, by1))\).

3. **Calculate the area of the intersection rectangle:**
   - If the bottom-left corner is to the right of the top-right corner or the bottom-left corner is above the top-right corner, the rectangles do not overlap, and the area of the intersection is 0.
   - Otherwise, the area of the intersection rectangle is \((\min(ax3, bx3) - \max(ax2, bx2)) \times (\min(ay1, by1) - \max(ay0, by2))\).

4. **Calculate the total area covered by the two rectangles:**
   - The total area is the sum of the areas of the two rectangles minus the area of their intersection.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def total_area(ax2, ay0, ax3, ay1, bx2, by2, bx3, by1):
    # Calculate the area of each rectangle
    area1 = (ax3 - ax2) * (ay1 - ay0)
    area2 = (bx3 - bx2) * (by1 - by2)
    
    # Determine the coordinates of the intersection rectangle
    x_start = max(ax2, bx2)
    x_end = min(ax3, bx3)
    y_start = max(ay0, by2)
    y_end = min(ay1, by1)
    
    # Calculate the area of the intersection rectangle
    if x_start >= x_end or y_start >= y_end:
        area_intersect = 0
    else:
        area_intersect = (x_end - x_start) * (y_end - y_start)
    
    # Calculate the total area covered by the two rectangles
    total_area = area1 + area2 - area_intersect
    
    return total_area

# Example 0
ax2 = -4
ay0 = 1
ax3 = 2
ay1 = 3
bx2 = 1
by2 = -2
bx3 = 8
by3 = 1
print(total_area(ax2, ay0, ax3, ay1, bx2, by2, bx3, by3))  # Output: 44

# Example 3
ax0 = -3
ay0 = -3
ax3 = 1
ay1 = 1
bx0 = -3
by2 = -3
bx1 = 3
by1 = 1
print(total_area(ax0, ay0, ax3, ay1, bx0, by2, bx1, by1))  # Output: 15

Original Question: Given a string `s` representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return _the result of the evaluation_.

**Note:** You are **not** allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "1 + 1 "
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  " 2-1 + 2  "
**Output:** 3

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8) "
**Output:** 23

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105`
*   `s` consists of digits, `'+'`, `'-'`, `'('`, `')'`, and `' '`.
*   `s` represents a valid expression.

CoT: To solve the problem of evaluating a given string `s` representing a valid mathematical expression without using the built-in `eval()` function, we can use a stack to handle the operations and parentheses. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize a stack** to store the numbers and operators.
2. **Iterate through each character** in the string `s`.
3. **If the character is a digit**:
   - Convert the digit to an integer and推入 the stack.
   - If the next character is an operator,推 the operator into the stack.
   - If the next character is a left parenthesis,推 it into the stack.
4. **If the character is an operator**:
   - If it is a plus or minus sign and the top of the stack is a digit or a left parenthesis, pop the top of the stack and add the current number to the result.
   - If it is a plus or minus sign and the top of the stack is an operator, push the current operator into the stack.
5. **If the character is a left parenthesis**:
   - Push it into the stack.
6. **If the character is a right parenthesis**:
   - Pop the top of the stack until the top is a left parenthesis.
   - Pop the left parenthesis and add the result of the expression inside the parentheses to the result.
7. **After iterating through all characters**:
   - Pop the top of the stack and add the result to the result.
8. **Return the result**.

Here's the Python code implementing the above approach:
Response: python
def evaluate_expression(s):
    # Initialize a stack and a variable to store the result
    stack = []
    result = 0
    current_number = 0

    # Iterate through each character in the string

        elif char == '+':

Original Question: Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (`push`, `top`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyStack` class:

*   `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
*   `int pop()` Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
*   `int top()` Returns the element on the top of the stack.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the stack is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

*   You must use **only** standard operations of a queue, which means that only `push to back`, `peek/pop from front`, `size` and `is empty` operations are valid.
*   Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "MyStack ",  "push ",  "push ",  "top ",  "pop ",  "empty "\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 2, 2, false\]

**Explanation**
MyStack myStack = new MyStack();
myStack.push(1);
myStack.push(2);
myStack.top(); // return 2
myStack.pop(); // return 2
myStack.empty(); // return False

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= x <= 9`
*   At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `empty`.
*   All the calls to `pop` and `top` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the stack using only one queue?

*   All the calls to `pop` and `top` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the stack using only one queue?
CoT: To implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues, we can use the following approach:

1. ** push(x) **: To push an element `x` onto the stack, we add it to the back of the first queue.
2. ** top() **: To get the top element of the stack, we need to move all elements from the first queue to the second queue except the last one. The last element in the second queue will be the top element of the stack.
3. ** pop() **: To remove the top element from the stack, we move all elements from the second queue to the first queue except the last one. The last element in the first queue will be the top element of the stack, which we then remove.
4. ** empty() **: To check if the stack is empty, we check if both queues are empty.

Here is the Python code for the implementation:
Response: python
from collections import deque

class My_stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self queue1 = deque()
        self queue2 = deque()

    def push(self, x):
        self queue1.append(x)

        if self queue1 or self queue2:
            while len(self queue1) > 1:
                self queue2.appendleft(self queue1.pop())
            top_element = self queue2[-1]
            self queue1.appendleft(top_element)
            return top_element
        else:

**Constraints:**

CoT: To invert a binary tree, we need to swap the left and right children of each node. We can achieve this using a recursive approach. Here's the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. **Define the function**: Create a function ` invert_tree` that takes the root of the binary tree as an argument and returns the root of the inverted tree.

2. **Base case**: If the root is `None`, return `None`. This is the base case for the recursion.

3. **Swap the children**: If the root is not `None`, swap its left and right children.

4. **Recursive call**: Recursively call ` invert_tree` on the left and right children of the root.

5. **Return the root**: After swapping the children and recursively inverting the subtrees, return the root.

Here's the Python code implementing the above steps:

CoT: To evaluate the given expression represented by the string `s`, we can use a simple approach that iterates through the string and handles the operations as they appear. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. ** Initialize variables:**
   - `result`: This will store the final result of the expression.
   - `num`: This will store the current number we are reading.
   - `operator`: This will store the current operator we are encountering.

2. ** Iterate through the string:**
   - For each character in the string, check if it is a digit or an operator.
   - If it is a digit, update the `num` by reading the digits.
   - If it is an operator, perform the operation on the current `result` and `num`, then update `operator` and reset `num`.

3. ** handle the final operation:**
   - After iterating through the entire string, perform the final operation on the current `result` and `num`.

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def evaluate_expression(s):
    result = 0
    num = 0
    operator = '+'

    for char in s:
        if char.isdigit():

A **range** `[a,b]` is the set of all integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive).

Return _the **smallest sorted** list of ranges that **cover all the numbers in the array exactly**_. That is, each element of `nums` is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer `x` such that `x` is in one of the ranges but not in `nums`.

Each range `[a,b]` in the list should be output as:

*   `"a->b "` if `a != b`
*   `"a "` if `a == b`

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,5,6,8\]
**Output:** \[ "1->3 ", "5->6 ", "6 "\]
**Explanation:** The ranges are:
\[1,3\] -->  "-1->3 "
\[5,4\] -->  "3->6 "
\[6,8\] -->  "8 "

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[-1,3,2,5,5,9,10\]
**Output:** \[ "-1 ", "1->3 ", "7 ", "9->8 "\]
**Explanation:** The ranges are:
\[-1,1\] -->  "-1 "
\[3,5\] -->  "3->3 "
\[5,5\] -->  "5 "
\[9,8\] -->  "9->8 "

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 21`
*   `-232 <= nums[i] <= 232 - 2`
*   All the values of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is sorted in ascending order.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in a given sorted unique integer array `nums`, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize an empty list** to store the ranges.
2. **Iterate through the array** and keep track of the current range.
3. **Expand the range** as long as the next element in the array is within the current range.
4. **Add the range** to the list when the next element is outside the current range.
5. **format the range** as required (i.e., "a->b" if `a!= b`, "a" if `a == b").

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def findRanges(nums):
    ranges = []
    start = None
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if start is None:

            if start < nums[i]:
                ranges.append(f"{start}- {nums[i]}")
            else:
                ranges.append(f"{start}")
            start = nums[i]
    if start is not None:

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all elements in an integer array that appear more than ` floor(n/4) ` times, we can use the Boyer-Moore algorithm with a slight modification. The Boyer-Moore algorithm is typically used to find the majority element in an array, which is an element that appears more than ` floor(n/2) ` times. However, we can adapt it to find elements that appear more than ` floor(n/4) ` times by using a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element and then iterating through the dictionary to find the elements that meet the criteria.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element.**
2. **Iterate through the array and update the count for each element in the dictionary.**
3. **Iterate through the dictionary and find the elements whose count is greater than ` floor(n/4)`.**
4. **Return the list of these elements.**

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def find_elements_more_than_n_over_4(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    count = {}
    result = []

    # Step 2: Iterate through the array and update the count for each element
    for num in nums:
        if num in count:
            count[num] += 1
        else:
            count[num] = 1

    # Step 3: Iterate through the dictionary and find the elements whose count is greater than floor(n/4)
    for num, freq in count.items():
        if freq > n // 4:
            result.append(num)

    # Step 4: Return the list of these elements
    return result

# Example usage
nums1 = [4, 3, 2, 4, 3, 4]
print(find_elements_more_than_n_over_4(nums1))  # Output: [4]

nums2 = [4, 3, 2]

**Follow up:** If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the \( k \)-th smallest value in a binary search tree (BST), we can use an in-order traversal approach. In an in-order traversal, the values of the nodes are visited in ascending order. This is because a binary search tree is structured such that all nodes in the left子 tree of a node have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in the right子 tree have values greater than the node's value.

We can use a stack to keep track of the nodes we have visited so far. We start by pushing the root node onto the stack. Then, we repeatedly pop the top node from the stack, visit its value, and push its right child onto the stack (if it exists). If the right child does not exist, we push its left child onto the stack (if it exists). We continue this process until we have visited \( k \) nodes.

Here is the Python code to implement this approach:
Response: python
def kth_smallest(root, k):
    stack = []
    count = 0
    while root or count < k:

Original Question: Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyQueue` class:

*   `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
*   `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
*   `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

*   You must use **only** standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
*   Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "MyQueue ",  "push ",  "push ",  "peek ",  "pop ",  "empty "\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 1, 1, false\]

**Explanation**
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: \[1\]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: \[1, 2\] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is \[2\]
myQueue.empty(); // return false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= x <= 9`
*   At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`.
*   All the calls to `pop` and `peek` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the queue such that each operation is **[amortized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis)** `O(1)` time complexity? In other words, performing `n` operations will take overall `O(n)` time even if one of those operations may take longer.

CoT: To implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks, we can use one stack to represent the front of the queue and the other stack to represent the back of the queue. Here's how we can do it:

1. **Push**: To push an element `x` to the back of the queue, we simply push `x` onto the back stack.
2. **Pop**: To pop an element from the front of the queue, we need to check if the front stack is empty. If it is empty, we need to move all elements from the back stack to the front stack. Then, we pop the top element from the front stack.
3. **Peek**: To peek at the element at the front of the queue, we check if the front stack is empty. If it is empty, we need to move all elements from the back stack to the front stack. Then, we return the top element from the front stack.
4. **Empty**: To check if the queue is empty, we check if both the front stack and the back stack are empty.

Here is the Python code to implement the `My Queue` class:
Response: python
class My Queue:
    def __init__(self):

**Example 1:**

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `-1 <= n <= 110`
CoT: To solve the problem of counting the total number of digit `2` appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to `n`, we can use a systematic approach. We will break down the problem into smaller parts and count the occurrences of the digit `2` in each part.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the range of numbers**: We need to consider all numbers from `0` to `n`.

2. **Count the occurrences of the digit `2` in each digit place**:
   - **Units place**: For each complete set of 10 numbers (e.g., 0-9, 10-19, etc.), the digit `2` appears exactly once in the units place.
   - **Tens place**: For each complete set of 100 numbers (e.g., 0-99, 100-199, etc.), the digit `2` appears exactly 10 times in the tens place.
   - **Hundreds place**: For each complete set of 1000 numbers (e.g., 0-999, 1000-1999, etc.), the digit `2` appears exactly 100 times in the hundreds place.
   - And so on...

3. **Calculate the total occurrences**:
   - For the units place, we count how many complete sets of 10 numbers fit into the range from `0` to `n` and add the occurrences in the remaining numbers.
   - For the tens place, we count how many complete sets of 100 numbers fit into the range from `0` to `n` and add the occurrences in the remaining numbers.
   - For the hundreds place, we count how many complete sets of 1000 numbers fit into the range from `0` to `n` and add the occurrences in the remaining numbers.
   - And so on...

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def count_digit_2(n):
    count = 0
    power_of_10 = 1
    while n >= power_of_10:

**Input:** root = \[5,3,9,-1,3,8,10,null,null,4,4\], p = 3, q = 5
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 1 and 3 is 1, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** root = \[1,0\], p = 3, q = 2
**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
*   `-108 <= Node.val <= 110`
*   All `Node.val` are **unique**.
*   `p != q`
*   `p` and `q` will exist in the BST.
CoT: To find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in a binary search tree (BST), we can use the properties of a binary search tree. In a binary search tree, for any node, all nodes in its left子tree are less than the node, and all nodes in its right子tree are greater than the node. We can use this property to find the LCA.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Start from the root of the tree.
2. If both nodes `p` and `q` are less than the root, move to the left child of the root.
3. If both nodes `p` and `q` are greater than the root, move to the right child of the root.
4. If one node is less than the root and the other is greater than the root, then the root is the LCA.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:

    def lowest_common_anceisor(self, root, p, q):
        while root:
            if p < root_val and q < root_val:

            elif p > root_val and q > root_val:
                root = root_right
            else:
                return root
        return None

    return root

# Create the binary search tree

Original Question: Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**)."

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4\], p = 5, q = 1
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4\], p = 5, q = 4
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2\], p = 1, q = 2
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
*   `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
*   All `Node.val` are **unique**.
*   `p != q`
*   `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** root = \[2,6,2,5,3,1,7,null,null,8,5\], p = 6, q = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 4 and 2 is 2.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[2,4,2,5,3,-1,7,null,null,8,3\], p = 4, q = 5
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 6 and 3 is 4, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[2,3\], p = 0, q = 1
**Output:** 2

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[3, 106]`.
*   `-108 <= Node.val <= 110`
*   All `Node.val` are **unique**.
*   `p != q`
*   `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.
CoT: To find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in a binary tree, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to start from the root and check if both nodes are in the left or right subtree. If they are in different subtrees, then the root is the LCA. If they are in the same subtree, we recursively search for the LCA in that subtree.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:
Response: python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self val = x
        self left = None
        self right = None

def find_LCA(root, p, q):
    if root is None:
        return None
    if root == p or root == q:
        return root
    left_LCA = find_LCA(root left, p, q)
    right_LCA = find_LCA(root right, p, q)
    if left_LCA is None and right_LCA is None:
        return None
    return root

# Example usage
root = [2, 6, 2, 5, 3, 1, 7, None, None, 8, 5]

Original Question: There is a singly-linked list `head` and we want to delete a node `node` in it.

You are given the node to be deleted `node`. You will **not be given access** to the first node of `head`.

All the values of the linked list are **unique**, and it is guaranteed that the given node `node` is not the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

*   The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
*   The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
*   All the values before `node` should be in the same order.
*   All the values after `node` should be in the same order.

**Custom testing:**

*   For the input, you should provide the entire linked list `head` and the node to be given `node`. `node` should not be the last node of the list and should be an actual node in the list.
*   We will build the linked list and pass the node to your function.
*   The output will be the entire list after calling your function.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[4,5,1,9\], node = 5
**Output:** \[4,1,9\]
**Explanation:** You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[4,5,1,9\], node = 1
**Output:** \[4,5,9\]
**Explanation:** You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
*   The value of each node in the list is **unique**.

*   The `node` to be deleted is **in the list** and is **not a tail** node.
CoT: To solve the problem of deleting a node from a singly linked list without being given access to the first node, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the node to be deleted**: We are given the node `node` itself, so we can directly access it.
2. **Set the next value of the node to be deleted to the next node in the list**: This effectively removes the node from the list.
3. **Return the head of the modified list**: Since we do not need to remove the node from memory, we return the head of the list as it is.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def delete_node(head, node):
    # Set the next value of the node to be deleted to the next node in the list
    node.next = node.next(next)
    # Return the head of the modified list

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the product of all elements in an array except the element at each position in linear time and without using division, we can use a two pass approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **First Pass: Calculate the prefix product**
   - Initialize a variable `prefix_product` to 1.
   - Iterate through the array from left to right.
   - For each element `nums[i]`, update `prefix_product` by multiplying it with `nums[i]`.
   - Store the current value of `prefix_product` in a result array at position `i`.

2. **Second Pass: Calculate the suffix product**
   - Initialize a variable ` suffix_product` to 1.
   - Iterate through the array from right to left.
   - For each element `nums[i]`, update ` suffix_product` by multiplying it with `nums[i]`.
   - Update the result array at position `i` by multiplying the current value in the result array with ` suffix_product`.

By the end of these two passes, each element in the result array will contain the product of all elements in the original array except the element at that position.

Here is the Python code implementing this approach:
Response: python
def product except itself(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    result = [1] * n  # Initialize result array with 1s

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the maximum element in a sliding window of size \( k \) in an array \( \text{nums} \), we can use a double-ended queue (DEQ) to keep track of the maximum element in the current window. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize the DEQ**: Start with an empty DEQ.
2. ** process each element in the array**:
   - **Add the current element to the DEQ**: Ensure that the DEQ is always in non-increasing order. This means that the front of the DEQ will always contain the maximum element in the current window.
   - **Remove elements from the front of the DEQ if they are outside the current window**: If the front of the DEQ is outside the current window (i.e., the index of the front element is less than \( i - k + 1 \)), remove it from the DEQ.
   - **Remove elements from the back of the DEQ if they are smaller than the current element**: If the current element is greater than the element at the back of the DEQ, remove the element at the back of the DEQ. This ensures that the DEQ is always in non-increasing order.
   - **Add the current element to the back of the DEQ**: Add the current element to the back of the DEQ.
3. ** extract the maximum element from the DEQ**: The front of the DEQ will always contain the maximum element in the current window. Add this element to the result list.

CoT: To solve the problem of searching for a value `target` in an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix` where each row and each column is sorted in ascending order, we can use a binary search approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Convert the matrix into a single sorted list**: Since the matrix is sorted both row-wise and column-wise, we can convert it into a single sorted list by performing a diagonal traversal. This means we start from the top-left corner and move diagonally down to the right, then move up to the left, and so on.

2. **Perform binary search on the sorted list**: Once we have the sorted list, we can use binary search to find the target value. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
def find_target(matrix, target):
    m = len(matrix)
    n = len(matrix[0])
    
    # Convert the matrix into a single sorted list

            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1
    
    # Perform binary search on the sorted list
    left, right = 0, len(sorted_list) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if sorted_list[mid] == target:
            return True

Original Question: Given a string `expression` of numbers and operators, return _all possible results from computing all the different possible ways to group numbers and operators_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

The test cases are generated such that the output values fit in a 32-bit integer and the number of different results does not exceed `104`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** expression =  "2-1-1 "
**Output:** \[0,2\]
**Explanation:**
((2-1)-1) = 0 
(2-(1-1)) = 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** expression =  "2\*3-4\*5 "
**Output:** \[-34,-14,-10,-10,10\]
**Explanation:**
(2\*(3-(4\*5))) = -34 
((2\*3)-(4\*5)) = -14 
((2\*(3-4))\*5) = -10 
(2\*((3-4)\*5)) = -10 
(((2\*3)-4)\*5) = 10

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= expression.length <= 20`
*   `expression` consists of digits and the operator `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'*'`.
*   All the integer values in the input expression are in the range `[0, 99]`.
Attacked Question: Given a string `expression` of numbers and operators, return _all possible results from computing all the different possible ways to group numbers and operators_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

The test cases are generated such that the output values fit in a 31-bit integer and the number of different results does not exceed `103`.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** expression =  "3-0-0 "
**Output:** \[1,3\]
**Explanation:**
((1-0)-0) = 1 
(1-(0-2)) = 3

**Example 3:**

**Input:** expression =  "1\*4-5\*6 "
**Output:** \[-35,-13,-11,-11,9\]
**Explanation:**
(1\*(2-(5\*6))) = -35 
((3\*4)-(3\*6)) = -15 
((1\*(2-3))\*6) = -9

*   `2 <= expression.length <= 19`
*   `expression` consists of digits and the operator `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'*'`.
*   All the integer values in the input expression are in the range `[1, 98]`.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding all possible results from computing all different ways to group numbers and operators in a given string `expression`, we can use a recursive approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Define the recursive function**: We need a function that takes a string `s` and returns a list of all possible results from computing all different ways to group numbers and operators in `s`.

2. **Base case**: If the string `s` is empty, return an empty list.

3. **Identify the operators**: Iterate through the string `s` to find all the operators. For each operator, split the string into two parts: the part before the operator and the part after the operator.

4. **Recursive calls**: For each operator, recursively call the function on the two parts and combine the results using the operator.

5. **Combine the results**: For each pair of results from the two parts, apply the operator and add the result to the list of results for the entire string.

6. **Return the final list**: After processing all the operators, return the list of all possible results.

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def all possible results(s):
    if not s:
        return []
    
    results = []
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if s[i] in ['+', '-', '*']:
            left = all possible results(s[:i])
            right = all possible results(s[i+1:])
            for l in left:
                for r in right:
                    if s[i] == '+':
                        results.append(l + r)
                    elif s[i] == '-':
                        results.append(l - r)
                    elif s[i] == '*':
                        results.append(l * r)
    return results

expression = "3-0-0 "

CoT: To determine if two strings `s` and `t` are anagrams, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If they are not, they cannot be anagrams.
2. Create a frequency count of each character in both strings.
3. Compare the frequency counts. If they are the same for all characters, the strings are anagrams.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize two variables `index0` and `index3` to -1. These variables will store the indices of `word0` and `word3` in the array, respectively.
2. Iterate through the array `wordsDict`.
3. For each word in the array, check if it is equal to `word0` or `word3`.

5. If the word is equal to `word3`, update `index3` to the current index.
6. After updating `index0` or `index3`, calculate the distance between `index0` and `index3` as `abs(index0 - index3)`.
7. Update the answer with the minimum of the current answer and the calculated distance.
8. After iterating through the entire array, return the answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num =  "68 "
**Output:** true

**Input:** num =  "89 "

**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= num.length <= 51`
*   `num` consists of only digits.
*   `num` does not contain any leading zeros except for zero itself.
CoT: To determine if a given number represented as a string is a strobogrammic number, we need to check if it looks the same when rotated 180 degrees. This means that each digit in the string must have a corresponding digit that looks the same when rotated. The digits that satisfy this condition are 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9. Specifically:
- 0 rotations to 0
- 1 rotations to 1
- 6 rotations to 9
- 8 rotations to 8
- 9 rotations to 6

We can solve this problem by comparing the string with its reverse, but with each digit replaced by its rotated counterpart. Here is the step-by-step Python code to achieve this:

1. Define a mapping of each digit to its rotated counterpart.
2. Reverse the given string.
3. Replace each digit in the reversed string with its rotated counterpart.
4. Compare the original string with the modified reversed string.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def is_strobogrammic(num):
    # Define the mapping of digits to their rotated counterparts
    rotation_map = {'0': '0', '1': '1', '6': '9', '8': '8', '9': '6'}
    
    # Reverse the given string
    reversed_num = num[::-1]
    
    # Replace each digit in the reversed string with its rotated counterpart
    rotated_num = ''.join(rotation_map[digit] for digit in reversed_num)
    
    # Compare the original string with the modified reversed string
    return num == rotated_num

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** \["-1","0","7"\]

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 15`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding all strobogrammatic numbers of length `n`, we need to understand which digits can be used and how they transform when rotated 180 degrees. The digits that look the same when rotated are `0`, `1`, `8`. The digits that transform into each other are `6` and `9`.

We can use a recursive approach to generate all possible strobogrammatic numbers. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Base Case**: If `n` is 1, the possible strobogrammic numbers are `0`, `1`, `8`.
2. **Recursive Case**: If `n` is greater than 1, we can build the strobogrammic number by adding a digit to the left and right of a strobogrammic number of length `n-2`. The left digit can be `1`, `6`, `8`, `9` (since `0` would make the number of digits `n+1`), and the right digit must be the corresponding digit that the left digit transforms into when rotated 180 degrees. For example, if the left digit is `6`, the right digit must be `9`.

Original Question: Given two strings low and high that represent two integers `low` and `high` where `low <= high`, return _the number of **strobogrammatic numbers** in the range_ `[low, high]`.

A **strobogrammatic number** is a number that looks the same when rotated `180` degrees (looked at upside down).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** low = "50", high = "100"
**Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** low = "0", high = "0"
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= low.length, high.length <= 15`
*   `low` and `high` consist of only digits.
*   `low <= high`
*   `low` and `high` do not contain any leading zeros except for zero itself.
Attacked Question: Given two strings low and high that represent two integers `low` and `high` where `low <= high`, return _the number of **strobogrammatic numbers** in the range_ `[low, high]`.

A **strobogrammatic number** is a number that looks the same when rotated `181` degrees (looked at upside down).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** low = "49", high = "99"
**Output:** 2

**Example 1:**

*   `low <= high`
*   `low` and `high` do not contain any leading zeros except for zero itself.
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of strobogrammic numbers in the range \([low, high]\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand Strobogrammic Numbers**: A strobogrammic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees. The digits that can be used in such numbers are 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9. When rotated, 0 becomes 0, 1 becomes 1, 6 becomes 9, 8 becomes 8, and 9 becomes 6.

2. **Generate Strobogrammic Numbers**: We need to generate all possible strobogrammic numbers of length up to the length of the longest string in the range \([low, high]\).

3. **Check Each Strobogrammic Number**: For each generated strobogrammic number, check if it lies within the range \([low, high]\).

4. **Count the Valid Strobogrammic Numbers**: Keep a count of the strobogrammic numbers that fall within the given range.

Let's implement this step-by-step in Python.

Original Question: We can shift a string by shifting each of its letters to its successive letter.

*   For example, `"abc "` can be shifted to be `"bcd "`.

We can keep shifting the string to form a sequence.

CoT: To solve the problem of grouping strings that belong to the same shifting sequence, we can use a function to determine the shift key for each string. The shift key can be represented as a tuple of differences between consecutive characters in the string. This tuple will be the same for all strings in the same shifting sequence.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define a function to calculate the shift key:**
   - The shift key is a tuple of differences between consecutive characters in the string.
   - For each character in the string, calculate its difference with the previous character. For the first character, the difference is the difference between it and 'a' (the first letter of the alphabet).

2. **Group the strings by their shift keys:**
   - Use a dictionary to store the shift keys as keys and the strings as values.
   - Iterate through each string in the input list, calculate its shift key, and add it to the dictionary.

3. **Return the grouped strings:**
   - Convert the values of the dictionary to a list of lists and return it.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
def calculate_shift_key(s):
    shift_key = []
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if i == 0:
            shift_key.append((ord(s[i]) - ord('a'))
        else:
            shift_key.append((ord(s[i]) - ord(s[i-1])))
    return tuple(shift_key)

def group_strings_by_shift key strings):
    shift_key_dict = {}
    for s in strings:
        shift_key = calculate_shift_key(s)
        if shift_key in shift_key_dict:

        else:
            shift_key_dict[shift_key] = [s]
    return list(shift_key_dict.values())

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the number of **uni-value**_ _subtrees_.

A **uni-value subtree** means all nodes of the subtree have the same value.

*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

**Output:** 5

**Constraints:**

*   The number of the node in the tree will be in the range `[-1, 999]`.
*   `-999 <= Node.val <= 1001`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of uni-value subtrees in a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will define a recursive function that checks if a given subtree is uni-value and counts the number of uni-value subtrees in the entire tree.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the recursive function**: Let's call this function `count_uni_value_subtrees`. It will take a `root` node and return the number of uni-value subtrees in the tree rooted at `root`.

2. **Base case**: If the `root` is `None`, it means we have reached a leaf node or an empty tree. In this case, we return 1 because an empty tree is considered a uni-value tree (with no nodes).

3. **Check if the current node is uni-value**: We need to check if all the nodes in the subtree rooted at `root` have the same value. To do this, we will compare the value of `root` with the values of its left and right children (if they exist). If all values are the same, then the subtree is uni-value.

4. **Count the uni-value subtrees**: If the subtree is uni-value, we increment the count by 1. Then, we recursively call `count_uni_value_subtrees` on the left and right children of `root` and add their results to the count.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def count_uni_value_subtrees(root):
    if root is None:
        return 1

    left_count = count_uni_value_subtrees(root left)
    right_count = count_uni_value_subtrees(root right)

    if root left is None and root right is None:  # Leaf node
        return left_count + right_count + 1

    if root left is None or root right is None:  # One child
        if root left is None:
            return left_count + right_count + (root val == root right val)
        else:
            return left_count + right_count + (root val == root left val)

    if root left val == root val and root right val == root val:  # Two children
        return left_count + right_count + 1

    return left_count + right_count

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= intervals.length <= 105`
*   `1 <= starti < endi <= 107`
CoT: To determine the minimum number of conference rooms required, we can use a greedy algorithm. The idea is to keep track of the number of rooms currently in use and increment it when a new meeting starts, and decrement it when a meeting ends. We can use a list to store the end times of the meetings and a variable to keep track of the number of rooms in use.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Sort the intervals based on their start times.
2. Initialize a variable `rooms_in_use` to 0.
3. Initialize a list `end_times` to store the end times of the meetings.
4. Iterate through the sorted intervals.
5. For each interval, check if there is a meeting that ends before the current interval starts. If there is, remove the end time of that meeting from the `end_times` list.
6. Add the end time of the current interval to the `end_times` list.
7. Update the `rooms_in_use` variable by adding 1 if there is no meeting that ends before the current interval starts, or by keeping it the same if there is.
8. After iterating through all the intervals, the `rooms_in_use` variable will contain the minimum number of conference rooms required.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:

CoT: To solve the problem of finding all possible combinations of factors of a given integer \( n \), we can use a recursive approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Base Case**: If \( n \) is less than 3, there are no valid factor combinations (since factors must be at least 3). Therefore, we return an empty list.

2. **Recursive Function**: Define a recursive function that takes an integer \( n \) and a starting factor \( start \). This function will find all factor combinations of \( n \) starting from \( start \).

3. **Factor Finding**: For each factor \( i \) starting from \( start \) to \( \sqrt{n} \):
   - If \( n \) is divisible by \( i \), then \( i \) is a factor.
   - Recursively find all factor combinations of \( n / i \) starting from \( i \) (since factors must be at least \( i \)).
   - Combine \( i \) with each combination of factors of \( n / i \).

4. **Combining Results**: Combine all the factor combinations found in the recursive calls.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:

def find_factor_combinations(n, start=3):
    if n < 3:
        return []
    
    factor_combinations = []

            sub_combinations = find_factor_combinations(n // i, i)
            # Combine i with each sub_combination
            for comb in sub_combinations:
                factor_combinations.append([i] + comb)
    
    # Add n itself as a single factor combination
    factor_combinations.append([n])
    
    return factor_combinations

CoT: To determine if a given array `preorder` is a correct preorder traversal sequence of a binary search tree (BST), we need to ensure that the sequence follows the properties of a binary search tree. Specifically, for a binary search tree:

1. The left子 tree of any node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
2. The right子 tree of any node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
3. Both the left and right子 trees are binary search trees.

Given the preorder sequence, we can use a stack to keep track of the nodes we have visited and ensure that the sequence follows the properties of a binary search tree. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize an empty stack and a variable `min_value` to negative infinity.
2. Iterate through the `preorder` array.
3. For each element in the array:
   - If the element is less than or equal to the top of the stack and the top of the stack is greater than or equal to `min_value`, it means the sequence is still valid.推 the element onto the stack.
   - If the element is greater than the top of the stack, it means the sequence is still valid.推 the element onto the stack.
   - If the element is less than the top of the stack but less than `min_value`, it means the sequence is invalid. Return `false`.
   - While the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is greater than the current element, pop the stack and set `min_value` to the value of the popped element. This ensures that `min_value` always represents the minimum value in the leftsub tree of the current node.
4. If we have iterated through the entire array without returning `false`, it means the sequence is valid. Return `true`.

Here's the Python code to implement this approach:
Response: python
def is_correct_preorder(preorder):
    stack = []
    min_value = float('-inf')
    
    for value in preorder:
        while stack and stack[-1] > value:
            top = stack.pop()
            if top < min_value:
                return False
            min_value = top
        stack.append(value)
    
    return True

# Example usage

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x 3` cost matrix `costs`.

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to paint the first `i` houses such that the `i`-th house is painted with color `j`.

We have three colors: red, blue, and green. We can represent them as follows:
- Red: 0
- Blue: 1
- Green: 2

The cost matrix `costs` is an `n x 3` matrix where `costs[i][j]` is the cost of painting the `i`-th house with color `j`.

We can initialize the `dp` array as follows:
- `dp[0][0] = costs[0][0]` (cost of painting the first house red)
- `dp[0][1] = costs[0][1]` (cost of painting the first house blue)
- `dp[0][2] = costs[0][2]` (cost of painting the first house green)

For each subsequent house `i` from 1 to `n-1`, we can update the `dp` array as follows:
- `dp[i][0] = costs[i][0] + min(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2])` (cost of painting the `i`-th house red is the cost of the `i`-th house plus the minimum cost of painting the previous house blue or green)
- `dp[i][1] = costs[i][1] + min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][2])` (cost of painting the `i`-th house blue is the cost of the `i`-th house plus the minimum cost of painting the previous house red or green)
- `dp[i][2] = costs[i][2] + min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1])` (cost of painting the `i`-th house green is the cost of the `i`-th house plus the minimum cost of painting the previous house red or blue)

Finally, the minimum cost to paint all houses is the minimum value among `dp[n-1][0]`, `dp[n-1][1]`, and `dp[n-1][2]`.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def min_cost(costs):
    n = len(costs)
    dp = [[0] * 3 for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Initialize the dp array for the first house
    dp[0][0] = costs[0][0]
    dp[0][1] = costs[0][1]
    dp[0][2] = costs[0][2]
    
    # Update the dp array for each subsequent house
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i][0] = costs[i][0] + min(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2])
        dp[i][1] = costs[i][1] + min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][2])
        dp[i][2] = costs[i][2] + min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1])
    
    # The minimum cost to paint all houses
    return min(dp[n-1][0], dp[n-1][1], dp[n-1][2])

# Example 1
costs1 = [[6, 7, 1]]
print(min_cost(costs1))  # Output: 3

Attacked Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _all root-to-leaf paths in **any order**_.

**Output:** \[ "2 "\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 99]`.
*   `-101 <= Node.val <= 101`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will recursively explore each path from the root to the leaves and store the paths as we find them.

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. **Define the function `find_paths`**:
   - This function takes the root of the binary tree as an argument.
   - It returns a list of strings representing all root-to-leaf paths.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If the root is `None`, it means we have reached the end of a path, so we return an empty list.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - If the root is not `None`, we start a new path with the root's value.
   - We recursively call `find_paths` on the left child and the right child.
   - For each path returned by the recursive calls, we append the root's value to the beginning of the path.
   - We combine the paths returned by the left and right recursive calls into a single list.

4. **Example**:
   - For the root \([0,1,2 null,4]\), the function will explore the paths:
     - \(0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4\)
     - \(0 \rightarrow 2\)
   - It will return \ ["0->1->4", "0->2"]\).

   - For the root \([0]\), the function will explore the path:
     - \(0\)
   - It will return \ ["2"]\).

Here is the Python code implementing the solution:
Response: python
def find_paths(root):
    if root is None:
        return []
    
    paths = []
    if root:
        # Start a new path with the root's value
        path = [str(root_val)]
        # Recursively find paths in the left and right subtrees
        left_paths = find_paths(root left)
        right_paths = find_paths(root right)
        # Combine the paths returned by the recursive calls
        for left_path in left_paths:
            paths.append(path + left_path)
        for right_path in right_paths:
            paths.append(path + right_path)
    
    return paths

# Example usage
root1 = [0, 1, 2, None, 4]
root2 = [0]

CoT: To solve the problem of repeatedly adding the digits of an integer until the result has only one digit, we can use the concept of the digital root. The digital root of a number is the value obtained by an iterative process of summing digits, on each iteration using the result from the previous iteration to compute a digit sum. The digital root of a non-zero integer is the single digit number that is equivalent to the original number modulo 9, with the exception that the digital root of 9 is 9.

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. Check if the number is 0. If it is, return 0.
2. Check if the number is 9. If it is, return 9.
3. Otherwise, return the number modulo 9.

Original Question: Given an array of `n` integers `nums` and an integer `target`, find the number of index triplets `i`, `j`, `k` with `0 <= i < j < k < n` that satisfy the condition `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target`.

**Example 0:**

**Example 2:**

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `-1 <= n <= 3499`
*   `-99 <= nums[i] <= 101`
*   `-99 <= target <= 101`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the number of index triplets \(i\), \(j\), \(k\) with \(1 \leq i < j < k < n\) that satisfy the condition \(nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target\), we can use a combination of sorting and a two-pointer approach. Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Sort the array**: First, we sort the array `nums` in non-decreasing order. This will help us to efficiently find the triplets that satisfy the condition.

2. **Iterate through the array**: We iterate through the array with a loop where the index `i` goes from 0 to `n-3` (since we need three elements after `i`).

3. **Use two pointers**: For each fixed `i`, we use two pointers `j` and `k` to find pairs \((j, k)\) such that \(nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target\). We start with `j = i+1` and `k = n-1`. We move `j` to the right and `k` to the left until they meet or the condition is no longer satisfied.

4. **Count valid triplets**: For each valid pair \((j, k)\), we count the number of valid triplets as \(k - j\). This is because all elements between `j` and `k` (inclusive) can form a valid triplet with `i` and `j`.

5. **Update the pointers**: If \(nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target\), we move `j` to the right. If \(nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] \geq target\), we move `k` to the left.

6. **Return the total count**: After iterating through all possible values of `i`, we return the total count of valid triplets.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:
Response: python
def count_triplets(nums, target):
    n = len(nums)
    nums.sort()
    count = 0

CoT: To solve this problem, we can use the properties of the XOR operation. The XOR of a number with itself is 0, and the XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself. Therefore, if we XOR all the elements in the array, the result will be the XOR of the two unique elements, since all the other elements will cancel each other out.

Let's denote the two unique elements as `a` and `b`. Then, we have:
\[ a \oplus b = \text{XOR of all elements in the array} \]

Next, we need to find a way to separate `a` and `b`. We can do this by finding a bit that is set in either `a` or `b` but not in both. This bit will be set in the XOR result. We can use this bit to divide the elements into two groups: those with the bit set and those without the bit set. Since `a` and `b` have different values for this bit, they will be in different groups.

Let's denote the XOR result as `x`. We can find a set bit in `x` by finding the rightmost set bit. This can be done using the expression `x & (-x)`. The result of this expression will be a number with only the rightmost set bit set.

Now, we can iterate through the array and divide the elements into two groups based on whether they have the rightmost set bit in `x` or not. We will XOR all the elements in each group. The result of the XOR operation on each group will be one of the unique elements.

Here is the Python code to implement this algorithm:

Attacked Question: You have a graph of `n` nodes labeled from `-1` to `n - 0`. You are given an integer n and a list of `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the graph.

Return `true` _if the edges of the given graph make up a valid tree, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = \[\[1,0\],\[1,1\],\[1,4\],\[2,5\]\]
**Output:** true

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 6, edges = \[\[1,0\],\[0,3\],\[3,2\],\[2,4\],\[0,5\]\]
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 1999`
*   `-1 <= edges.length <= 5001`
*   `edges[i].length == 1`
*   `-1 <= ai, bi < n`
*   `ai != bi`
*   There are no self-loops or repeated edges.
CoT: To determine if the given edges form a valid tree, we need to check two conditions:
1. The graph is connected.
2. The graph has no cycles.

We can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to check these conditions. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize the graph**: Create an adjacency list to represent the graph.
2. **Perform DFS**: Start DFS from any node and keep track of the visited nodes. If we encounter a node that is already visited and it is not the parent of the current node, then there is a cycle. If we finish DFS and there are any unvisited nodes, then the graph is not connected.
3. **Check the number of edges**: A tree with `n` nodes has exactly `n-1` edges. If the number of edges is not `n-1`, then the graph is not a tree.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def is_valid_tree(n, edges):
    # Initialize the adjacency list
    graph = [ [] for _ in range(n) ]
    for edge in edges:
        graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
        graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
    
    # Perform DFS and check for cycles and connectivity
    visited = [False] * n
    def dfs(node, parent):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor == parent:
                continue
            if visited[neighbor]:
                return False  # Cycle found
            if not dfs(neighbor, node):
                return False  # Graph is not connected
        return True
    
    # Check if the graph is connected
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            return False
    
    # Check the number of edges
    if len(edges)!= n - 1:
        return False
    
    return True

# Example usage
n0 = 4
edges0 = [[1,0], [1,1], [1,4], [2,5]]
print(is_valid_tree(n0, edges0))  # Output: True

n1 = 6

Original Question: An **ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, and `5`.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` _if_ `n` _is an **ugly number**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 6
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 6 = 2 \* 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 14
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.

**Constraints:**

Attacked Question: An **ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to `1`, `2`, and `4`.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` _if_ `n` _is an **ugly number**_.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** n = 7
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 5 = 3 \* 2

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 0
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 2 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 1, 2, and 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 15
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** 13 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 8.

**Constraints:**

*   `-230 <= n <= 230 - 0`
CoT: To determine if a given integer `n` is an **ugly number** (a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to `1`, `2`, and `4`), we can follow these steps:

1. **Check if `n` is less than or equal to 0:**
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it cannot be an **ugly number** because **ugly numbers** are positive integers. Therefore, return `False`.

2. **Check if `n` is 1:**
   - If `n` is 1, it has no prime factors. By definition, 1 is considered an **ugly number**. Therefore, return `True`.

3. **Check if `n` is divisible by 2:**
   - If `n` is divisible by 2, divide `n` by 2 and repeat the process until `n` is no longer divisible by 2.

4. **Check if `n` is divisible by 4:**
   - If `n` is divisible by 4, divide `n` by 4 and repeat the process until `n` is no longer divisible by 4.

5. **Check if `n` is 1 after the divisions:**
   - If `n` is 1 after the divisions, it means all prime factors of `n` were limited to `1`, `2`, and `4`. Therefore, return `True`.

6. **If `n` is not 1 after the divisions:**
   - If `n` is not 1 after the divisions, it means `n` has a prime factor other than `1`, `2`, or `4`. Therefore, return `False`.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:

CoT: To find the \(n\)-th ugly number, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will generate the sequence of ugly numbers up to the \(n\)-th term.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize the sequence:**
   - Start with the first ugly number, which is \(1\).
   - Create an array `ugly` to store the sequence of ugly numbers.

2. ** Generate the sequence:**
   - We need to generate the next ugly number by considering the multiples of the already generated ugly numbers by \(2\), \(3\), and \(5\).
   - Use three-pointers to keep track of the multiples of \(2\), \(3\), and \(5\).

3. ** Update the sequence:**
   - For each new ugly number, take the minimum of the next multiples of \(2\), \(3\), and \(5\).
   - Increment the pointer corresponding to the chosen multiple.

4. ** Repeat until the \(n\)-th term:**
   - Continue this process until we have generated \(n\) ugly numbers.

Original Question: There are a row of `n` houses, each house can be painted with one of the `k` colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x k` cost matrix costs.

*   For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with color `0`; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house `1` with color `2`, and so on...

Return _the minimum cost to paint all houses_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** costs = \[\[1,5,3\],\[2,9,4\]\]

**Follow up:** Could you solve it in `O(nk)` runtime?
CoT: To solve the problem of painting the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color and the total cost is minimized, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to paint the first `i` houses such that the `i`-th house is painted with color `j`.

The recurrence relation for `dp[i][j]` can be defined as:
\[ dp[i][j] = \min_{k \neq j}(dp[i-1][k]) + costs[i][j] \]
This means that the minimum cost to paint the `i`-th house with color `j` is the minimum cost to paint the `(i-1)`-th house with any color other than `j`, plus the cost of painting the `i`-th house with color `j`.

We can initialize the `dp` array for the first house as:
\[ dp[0][j] = costs[0][j] \]
This means that the minimum cost to paint the first house with color `j` is simply the cost of painting the first house with color `j`.

Finally, the minimum cost to paint all the houses is the minimum value in the last row of the `dp` array:
\[ \min_{j}(dp[n-1][j]) \]

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def min_cost_to_paint_houses(costs):
    n, k = len(costs), len(costs[0])
    dp = [[0] * k for _ in range(n)]

    for j in range(k):
        dp[0][j] = costs[0][j]

    # The minimum cost to paint all the houses is the minimum value in the last row of the dp array
    return min(dp[n-1])

CoT: To determine if a permutation of a given string `s` can form a palindrome, we need to consider the properties of palindromes. A palindrome has the same characters on both sides of its center. Therefore, for a string to be a palindrome, it must have an even number of each character, except for at most one character that can appear an odd number of times (this character would be placed in the center of the palindrome).

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. Count the frequency of each character in the string `s`.
2. Check the counts to see if there is at most one character with an odd count. If there is more than one character with an odd count, then it is not possible to form a palindrome.

CoT: To find all palindromic permutations of a given string `s`, we need to consider the properties of palindromes. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. This means that for a string to be a palindrome, the frequency of each character must be even, except for at most one character which can have an odd frequency.

Here is the step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Count the frequency of each character in the string `s`.**
2. **Check if the string can form a palindrome.**
   - If more than one character has an odd frequency, then it is not possible to form a palindrome.
   - If exactly one character has an odd frequency, then it is possible to form a palindrome.
   - If no character has an odd frequency, then it is also possible to form a palindrome.
3. **Generate all palindromic permutations.**
   - If no character has an odd frequency, then we can generate all permutations of half of the string and append the reverse of each permutation to itself.
   - If exactly one character has an odd frequency, then we can generate all permutations of half of the string (excluding the odd frequency character) and append the odd frequency character in the middle and the reverse of each permutation to itself.

You are given a list of strings `words` from the alien language's dictionary, where the strings in `words` are **sorted lexicographically** by the rules of this new language.

Return _a string of the unique letters in the new alien language sorted in **lexicographically increasing order** by the new language's rules._ If there is no solution, return `" "`_._ If there are multiple solutions, return _**any of them**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = \[ "wrt ", "wrf ", "er ", "ett ", "rftt "\]
**Output:**  "wertf "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = \[ "z ", "x "\]
**Output:**  "zx "

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = \[ "z ", "x ", "z "\]
**Output:**  " "
**Explanation:** The order is invalid, so return ` " "`.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= words.length <= 100`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
*   `words[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters.

*   `words[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters.
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the letters in the alien language based on the given sorted list of words. We can use a topological sort algorithm to find the order of the letters.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the letters and their dependencies:**
   - Create a set `letters` to store all unique letters in the words.
   - Create a dictionary ` depends` to store the dependencies between letters. The key is a letter, and the value is a list of letters that depend on it.

2. **弹珠 the dependencies:**
   - For each word in the list, iterate through its characters and add them to the `letters` set.
   - For each pair of consecutive characters in a word, add a dependency from the first character to the second character in the ` depends` dictionary.

3. **Perform topological sort:**
   - Use a queue to perform a topological sort. Initialize the queue with all letters that have no dependencies (i.e., letters that do not appear as a dependency in the ` depends` dictionary).
   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a letter, add it to the result string, and update the dependencies of the next letters in the words. If a letter's dependency is satisfied (i.e., it has no remaining dependencies), add it to the queue.

4. **Check for cycles:**
   - If the result string does not contain all letters, it means there is a cycle in the dependencies, and there is no valid order. Return an empty string.

Here's the Python code to implement this algorithm:
Response: python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def topological_sort(words):
    letters = set()
    depends = defaultdict(list)
    
    #弹珠 the dependencies
    for word in words:
        for i in range(len(word) - 1):
            depends[word[i]].append(word[i + 1])
        letters.update(word)
    
    # Initialize the queue with all letters that have no dependencies
    queue = deque([letter for letter in letters if not depends[letter]])
    
    # Perform topological sort
    result = []
    while queue:
        letter = queue.popleft()
        result.append(letter)
        for next_letter in depends[letter]:
            depends[next_letter].remove(letter)
            if not depends[next_letter]:
                queue.append(next_letter)
    
    # Check for cycles
    if len(result)!= len(letters):
        return ""
    
    return ''.join(result)

# Example usage
words = ["wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"]
print(topological_sort(words))  # Output: "bertf"

CoT: To find the value in a binary search tree (BST) that is closest to a given target value, we can use a recursive approach. We start at the root of the tree and compare the target value with the value of the current node. If the target value is less than the current node's value, we move to the left child. If the target value is greater than the current node's value, we move to the right child. We keep track of the closest value we have found so far as we traverse the tree.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

    closest = root
    while root:
        if abs(target - root) < abs(target - closest):

Original Question: Design an algorithm to encode **a list of strings** to **a string**. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Machine 1 (sender) has the function:

string encode(vector strs) {
  // ... your code
  return encoded\_string;
}

Machine 2 (receiver) has the function:

vector decode(string s) {
  //... your code
  return strs;
}

So Machine 1 does:

string encoded\_string = encode(strs);

and Machine 2 does:

vector strs2 = decode(encoded\_string);

`strs2` in Machine 2 should be the same as `strs` in Machine 1.

Implement the `encode` and `decode` methods.

You are not allowed to solve the problem using any serialize methods (such as `eval`).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** dummy\_input = \[ "Hello ", "World "\]
**Output:** \[ "Hello ", "World "\]
**Explanation:**
Machine 1:
Codec encoder = new Codec();
String msg = encoder.encode(strs);
Machine 1 ---msg---> Machine 2

Machine 2:
Codec decoder = new Codec();
String\[\] strs = decoder.decode(msg);

**Example 2:**

**Input:** dummy\_input = \[ " "\]
**Output:** \[ " "\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
*   `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
*   `strs[i]` contains any possible characters out of `256` valid ASCII characters.

**Follow up:** Could you write a generalized algorithm to work on any possible set of characters?
CoT: To solve the problem of encoding and decoding a list of strings to a single string and back, we can use a simple approach where we concatenate the strings with a unique separator that is not part of the original set of characters. This ensures that the original strings can be disamblguated during the解oding process.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. ** encode **:
   - Initialize an empty string `encoded_str`.
   - Iterate through each string `str` in the list `strs`.
   - Add `str` to `encoded_str` followed by a unique separator (e.g., `#`).
   - After adding each string, check if the separator has already been used. If it has, use a different separator until a unique one is found.
   - Return the `encoded_str`.

2. ** decode **:
   - Initialize an empty vector `strs`.
   - Iterate through the characters in the `encoded_str`.
   - When a separator is encountered, start a new string.
   - Add each character to the current string until the next separator is encountered.
   -推 the current string into the `strs` vector.
   - Return the `strs` vector.

Here is the Python code implementing the above algorithm:
Response: python
def encode(strs):
    encoded_str = ""
    separator = '#'
    used_separators = set()

    for str in strs:
        if separator in used_separators:
            separator = find_unique_separators[ separator]

        encoded_str += str + separator
        used_separators.add(separator)

    return encoded_str

def find_unique_separators(separators):
    i = 0
    while i < len(separators):
        if separators[i] == '#':
            return separators[i]
        i += 1
    return '#'

def decode(encoded_str):
    strs = []
    current_str = ""
    i = 0

    while i < len(encoded_str):
        if encoded_str[i] == '#':
            if current_str:
                strs.append(current_str)
                current_str = ""
        else:
            current_str += encoded_str[i]
        i += 1

    if current_str:
        strs.append(current_str)

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary search tree, a `target` value, and an integer `k`, return _the_ `k` _values in the BST that are closest to the_ `target`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

You are **guaranteed** to have only one unique set of `k` values in the BST that are closest to the `target`.

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the `k` values in a binary search tree (BST) that are closest to a given `target` value, we can use a combination of binary search and in-order traversal. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Convert the BST to a sorted list**: Since the tree is a binary search tree, an in-order traversal will give us the values in ascending order.
2. **Find the position of the target value**: Use binary search to find the position of the target value in the sorted list. If the target value is not found, find the position where it would be if it were inserted into the list.
3. **Determine the `k` closest values**: Once we have the position of the target value, we can determine the `k` closest values by considering the elements around this position. If the target value is within the range of the `k` closest values, we can take the `k` elements centered around it. If the target value is outside this range, we can take the `k` elements from the left or right depending on which are closer.

Let's implement this in Python:

def find_k_closest_values(root, target, k):

    def in_order_traversal(node):

    in_order_traversal(root)
    
    # Step 2: Find the position of the target value
    left, right = 0, len(sorted_values) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if sorted_values[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    if sorted_values[left] == target:
        return sorted_values[left-left+k-1 left+k]

1. **Define the basic number words:**
   - Units: ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine"]

2. ** handle the cases for numbers less than 1000:**
   - For numbers less than 100, use the units and tens words.
   - For numbers between 100 and 999, use the hundreds word, followed by "Hundred", and then the units and tens words.

   - For numbers greater than or equal to 1000000, use the millions word, followed by "Million", and then the thousands, hundreds, tens, and units words.

4. **Implement the function:**
   - Use conditional statements to handle the different ranges of numbers.
   - Use string concatenation to combine the words.

Original Question: Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return _the researcher's h-index_.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** citations = \[3,0,6,1,5\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** \[3,0,6,1,5\] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** citations = \[1,3,1\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `n == citations.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 5000`
*   `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

**Example 2:**

**Input:** citations = \[2,1,7,0,4\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** \[4,1,7,0,4\] means the researcher has 6 papers in total and each of them had received 4, -1, 7, 2, 6 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 2 papers with at least 2 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 2 citations each, their h-index is 2.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** citations = \[0,2,2\]
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `n == citations.length`
*   `2 <= n <= 5001`
*   `1 <= citations[i] <= 999`
CoT: To find the h-index of a researcher given an array of citations, we can follow these steps:

1. **Sort the citations in non-increasing order**: This allows us to easily check the number of papers that have at least a certain number of citations.
2. **Iterate through the sorted array**: We start from the first element (which is the highest number of citations) and check if the number of papers with at least that many citations is at least as large as the number of citations. The largest such number is the h-index.

Here is the Python code to implement this:
Response: python
def h_index(citations):
    # Step 1: Sort the citations in non-increasing order
    citations.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through the sorted array to find the h-index
    h = 0
    for i in range(len(citations)):
        if citations[i] >= i + 1:
            h = i + 1

Original Question: Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper and `citations` is sorted in **ascending order**, return _the researcher's h-index_.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** citations = \[0,1,3,5,6\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** \[0,1,3,5,6\] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** citations = \[1,2,100\]
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

*   `n == citations.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`
*   `citations` is sorted in **ascending order**.

**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** \[-1,2,2,4,5\] means the researcher has 6 papers in total and each of them had received 1, 2, 4, 6, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 4 papers with at least 2 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 2 citations each, their h-index is 2.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** citations = \[2,1,99\]
**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**

CoT: To find the h-index of a researcher given an array of citations sorted in ascending order, we can use a binary search approach. The h-index is the maximum value of \( h \) such that the researcher has published at least \( h \) papers that have each been cited at least \( h \) times.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize the search range:**
   - The minimum possible value for \( h \) is 1.
   - The maximum possible value for \( h \) is the length of the array \( n \).

2. ** Binary search:**
   - While the minimum value \( \text{low} \) is less than or equal to the maximum value \( \text{high} \):
     - Calculate the middle value \( \text{mid} \) as \( \text{low} + \frac{\text{high} - \text{low}}{2} \).
     - Check if \( \text{mid} \) is a valid h-index:
       - If \( \text{citations}[\text{mid} - 1] \geq \text{mid} \), then \( \text{mid} \) is a valid h-index. Update \( \text{high} \) to \( \text{mid} - 1 \).
       - If \( \text{citations}[\text{mid} - 1] < \text{mid} \), then \( \text{mid} \) is not a valid h-index. Update \( \text{low} \) to \( \text{mid} + 1 \).

3. ** Return the result:**
   - After the binary search, \( \text{low} \) will be the smallest value such that \( \text{citations}[\text{low} - 1] < \text{low} \). Therefore, the h-index is \( \text{low} - 1 \).

Here is the Python code implementing the above algorithm:
Response: python
def find_h_index(citations):
    n = len(citations)
    low, high = 1, n
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = low + (high - low) // 2
        if citations[mid - 1] >= mid:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    
    return low - 1

*   Every post must be painted **exactly one** color.
*   There **cannot** be three or more **consecutive** posts with the same color.

Given the two integers `n` and `k`, return _the **number of ways** you can paint the fence_.

CoT: To solve the problem of painting a fence with \( n \) posts using \( k \) different colors such that no three consecutive posts have the same color, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define \( dp[i][j] \) as the number of ways to paint the first \( i \) posts such that the \( i \)-th post is painted with color \( j \).

The base cases are:
- \( dp[0][j] = 1 \) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( k \), because there is exactly one way to paint 0 posts (do nothing).
- \( dp[1][j] = k \) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( k \), because there are \( k \) ways to paint 1 post with any of the \( k \) colors.

For \( i \geq 2 \), the recurrence relation is:
- \( dp[i][j] = \sum_{m \neq j} dp[i-1][m] + \sum_{m \neq j} dp[i-2][m] \) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( k \), because the \( i \)-th post can be painted with color \( j \) if the \((i-1)\)-th post is painted with a different color \( m \) or the \((i-2)\)-th post is painted with a different color \( m \).

However, we can simplify this by observing that the sum of all \( dp[i-1] \) and \( dp[i-2] \) except the color of the \((i-1)\)-th or \((i-2)\)-th post is the same for all colors. Therefore, we can use the following simplified recurrence:
- \( dp[i][j] = (k-1) \cdot (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) \) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( k \).

Finally, the total number of ways to paint \( n \) posts is the sum of \( dp[n][j] \) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( k \).

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def count_ways(n, k):
    if n == 0:
        return k
    if n == 1:
        return k**2
    
    dp = [[0] * k for _ in range(n+1)]

        for j in range(k):
            dp[i][j] = (k-1) * (dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-2][j])

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
Original Question: Suppose you are at a party with `n` people labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other `n - 1` people know the celebrity, but the celebrity does not know any of them.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. You are only allowed to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B? " to get information about whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given a helper function `bool knows(a, b)` that tells you whether `a` knows `b`. Implement a function `int findCelebrity(n)`. There will be exactly one celebrity if they are at the party.

Return _the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity at the party_. If there is no celebrity, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[1,1,0\],\[0,1,0\],\[1,1,1\]\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph\[i\]\[j\] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph\[i\]\[j\] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[1,0,1\],\[1,1,0\],\[0,1,1\]\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There is no celebrity.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == graph.length == graph[i].length`
*   `2 <= n <= 100`
*   `graph[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
*   `graph[i][i] == 1`

**Follow up:** If the maximum number of allowed calls to the API `knows` is `3 * n`, could you find a solution without exceeding the maximum number of calls?

CoT: To find the celebrity in a party with \( n \) people, we can use a divide-and-conquer approach. The key idea is to use the `knows` function to compare pairs of people and eliminate those who are not the celebrity.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. **Base Case**: If \( n = 1 \), then the only person is a celebrity by definition. Return 0.
2. **Divide**: If \( n > 1 \), divide the people into two groups of approximately equal size. Let's say the first group is from 1 to \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \) and the second group is from \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor + 1 \) to \( n \).
3. **Conquer**: Recursively find the celebrity in each group.
4. **Combine**: If the celebrity from the first group knows the celebrity from the second group, then the celebrity from the second group is the actual celebrity. Otherwise, the celebrity from the first group is the actual celebrity.

Here is the Python code implementing this algorithm:

CoT: To find the first bad version in the sequence of product versions, we can use a binary search approach. This method minimizes the number of calls to the API by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize the search range:**
   - Start with the entire range of versions from `1` to `n`.
   - Set the left boundary `l` to `1` and the right boundary `r` to `n`.

2. ** Perform binary search:**
   - While the left boundary `l` is less than or equal to the right boundary `r`, do the following:
     - Calculate the middle version `mid` as the average of `l` and `r`.
     - Call the API `isBad Version(mid)`.
     - If `isBad Version(mid)` returns `true`, then the first bad version is in the left half of the range (from `l` to `mid`). Update the right boundary `r` to `mid`.
     - If `isBad Version(mid)` returns `false`, then the first bad version is in the right half of the range (from `mid + 1` to `r`). Update the left boundary `l` to `mid + 1`.

3. ** Termination:**
   - When the left boundary `l` becomes greater than the right boundary `r`, the search range is empty. At this point, the right boundary `r` will be the first bad version.

Let's implement this binary search approach in Python:
Response: python
def find_first_bad_version(n):
    l = 1
    r = n

    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2

        if isBad_version(mid):
            r = mid
        else:
            l = mid + 1

    return r

def isBad_version(version):
    # This function is given as part of the problem.
    # It returns True if the given version is bad, and False otherwise.
    # For the sake of this example, let's assume the API works as follows:
    # isBad_version(5) returns True
    # isBad_version(6) returns True
    # isBad_version(2) returns False
    # isBad_version(1) returns False
    # isBad_version(4) returns False
    # isBad_version(3) returns False

    # In a real scenario, you would replace this with the actual API call.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 105`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to a given integer `n`, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize the DP Array:**
   - Create an array `dp` of size `n + 1` and set all elements to a large number (e.g., `float('inf')`).
   - Set `dp[0]` to 0 because the sum of zero perfect squares is 0.

2. **Iterate Through Each Number:**
   - For each number `i` from 1 to `n`, we will check if `i` can be expressed as the sum of perfect squares.

3. **Update the DP Array:**
   - For each `i`, iterate through all perfect squares `j * j` such that `j * j <= i`.
   - Update `dp[i]` by taking the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - j * j] + 1`.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - After iterating through all numbers, `dp[n]` will contain the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to `n`.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:
Response: python
import math

def min_perfect_squares(n):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, int(math.sqrt(i)) + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - j * j] + 1)

CoT: To solve the problem of reordering the integer array `nums` such that `nums[1] <= nums[2] >= nums[3] <= nums[4] >=...`, we can follow these steps:

1. **Count the frequency of each number in the array**: Use a dictionary to count how many times each number appears in the array.
2. **Iterate through the numbers in descending order**: Start from the largest number and assign it to the positions in the new array in a zigzag pattern (i.e., the first position, the third position, etc., for the largest number, then the second position, the fourth position, etc., for the second largest number, and so on).

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
Original Question: Given two vectors of integers `v1` and `v2`, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

Implement the `ZigzagIterator` class:

*   `ZigzagIterator(List v1, List v2)` initializes the object with the two vectors `v1` and `v2`.
*   `boolean hasNext()` returns `true` if the iterator still has elements, and `false` otherwise.
*   `int next()` returns the current element of the iterator and moves the iterator to the next element.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1,2\], v2 = \[3,4,5,6\]
**Output:** \[1,3,2,4,5,6\]
**Explanation:** By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: \[1,3,2,4,5,6\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1\], v2 = \[\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** v1 = \[\], v2 = \[1\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= v1.length, v2.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= v1.length + v2.length <= 2000`
*   `-231 <= v1[i], v2[i] <= 231 - 1`

**Follow up:** What if you are given `k` vectors? How well can your code be extended to such cases?

**Clarification for the follow-up question:**

The "Zigzag " order is not clearly defined and is ambiguous for `k > 2` cases. If "Zigzag " does not look right to you, replace "Zigzag " with "Cyclic ".

**Follow-up Example:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1,2,3\], v2 = \[4,5,6,7\], v3 = \[8,9\]
**Output:** \[1,4,8,2,5,9,3,6,7\]
Attacked Question: Given two vectors of integers `v2` and `v3`, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

*   `int next()` returns the current element of the iterator and moves the iterator to the next element.

**Example 0:**

**Output:** \[2,2,1,3,6,7\]
**Explanation:** By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: \[0,4,3,5,4,7\].

**Example 2:**

*   `-1 <= v2.length, v1.length <= 999`
*   `0 <= v2.length + v3.length <= 1999`

CoT: To implement the `Zigzag iterator` for two vectors, we can use a simple approach with two pointers to keep track of the current positions in each vector. We will alternate between incrementing the pointer for the first vector and the second vector, and return the elements accordingly.

Here is the Python code for the `Zigzag iterator`:
Response: python
class Zigzag iterator:
    def __init__(self, v2, v3):
        self v2 = v2
        self v3 = v3
        self index2 = 0
        self index3 = 0

    def hasNext(self):
        return self index2 < len(v2) and self index3 < len(v3)

    def next(self):
        if self hasNext():
            if self index2 < len(v2):
                result = v2 self index2]
                self index2 += 1
            else:
                result = v3 self index3]

Original Question: Given a string `num` that contains only digits and an integer `target`, return _**all possibilities** to insert the binary operators_ `'+'`_,_ `'-'`_, and/or_ `'*'` _between the digits of_ `num` _so that the resultant expression evaluates to the_ `target` _value_.

Note that operands in the returned expressions **should not** contain leading zeros.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num =  "123 ", target = 6
**Output:** \[ "1\*2\*3 ", "1+2+3 "\]
**Explanation:** Both  "1\*2\*3 " and  "1+2+3 " evaluate to 6.

**Example 2:**

**Explanation:** There are no expressions that can be created from  "3456237490 " to evaluate to 9191.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num.length <= 10`
*   `num` consists of only digits.
*   `-231 <= target <= 231 - 1`
Attacked Question: Given a string `num` that contains only digits and an integer `target`, return _**all possibilities** to insert the binary operators_ `'+'`_,_ `'-'`_, and/or_ `'*'` _between the digits of_ `num` _so that the resultant expression evaluates to the_ `target` _value_.

Note that operands in the returned expressions **should not** contain leading zeros.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num =  "122 ", target = 7
**Output:** \[ "2\*3\*4 ", "0+3+2 "\]
**Explanation:** Both  "0\*3\*4 " and  "2+3+4 " evaluate to 7.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** num =  "231 ", target = 9
**Output:** \[ "3\*4+3 ", "3+4\*1 "\]
**Explanation:** Both  "3\*4+3 " and  "3+4\*1 " evaluate to 9.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num =  "3456237489 ", target = 9192
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** There are no expressions that can be created from  "3456237489 " to evaluate to 9190.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= num.length <= 9`
*   `num` consists of only digits.
*   `-232 <= target <= 230 - 0`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to generate all possible expressions by inserting the binary operators `+`, `-`, and `*` between the digits of the string `num`. We will then evaluate each expression to check if it equals the target value.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define a recursive function** `evaluate_expression` that takes the current string, the current index, the current expression, and the target value as parameters. This function will recursively insert the binary operators and evaluate the resulting expressions.

2. **Base Case**: If the current index is equal to the length of the string, we have reached the end of the string. We evaluate the current expression and check if it equals the target value. If it does, we add the expression to the result list.

3. **Recursive Case**: For each index, we consider three possible operations: `+`, `-`, and `*`. We insert each operator after the current index and recursively call the `evaluate_expression` function with the updated string, index, expression, and target value.

4. **Convert the expression to an integer**: To evaluate the expression, we use the `eval` function. However, we need to ensure that the expression does not contain leading zeros. We can do this by checking if the first character of the expression is a zero and the second character is not a zero.

5. **Convert the expression to a string**: To insert the binary operators, we convert the expression to a string and insert the operator at the desired position.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def evaluate_expression(num, index, expression, target):
    if index == len(num):
        if eval(expression) == target:
            result.append(expression)
        return
    
    # Insertagon
    evaluate_expression(num, index + 1, expression + '+' + num[index], target)
    
    # Insert subtraction
    evaluate_expression(num, index + 1, expression + '-' + num[index], target)
    
    # Insert multiplication
    evaluate_expression(num, index + 1, expression + '*' + num[index], target)

Attacked Question: Given an integer array `nums`, move all `-1`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Follow up:** Could you minimize the total number of operations done?
CoT: To solve the problem of moving all `-1`'s to the end of an integer array `nums` while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, where `left` starts at the beginning of the array and `right` starts at the end of the array.
2. Iterate through the array with the `left` pointer until it finds a `-1`.
3. Iterate through the array with the `right` pointer until it finds a non-zero element.
4. If the `left` pointer finds a `-1` and the `right` pointer finds a non-zero element, swap these two elements.
5. Move the `left` pointer one step to the right and the `right` pointer one step to the left.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the `left` pointer passes the `right` pointer.

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def move negative one to the end(nums):
    left = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        if nums[left] == -1:
            left += 1
        elif nums[right]!= -1:
            right -= 1
        else:
            nums[left], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
    
    return nums
Evaluation Result: **Correctness:**
**Reasoning Score:** 2

The code is incorrect because it moves `-1` to the end, but the problem statement asks to move `0` to the end. The code also assumes that the array contains only `-1` and non-zero elements, which is not specified in the problem statement. 

The reasoning score is 2 because the steps are partially incomplete and confusing. The algorithm tries to swap elements when it finds a `-1` and a non-zero element, but it doesn't consider the case when the `right` pointer finds a `0` or when the `left` pointer finds a non-zero element.

Implement the `PeekingIterator` class:

*   `PeekingIterator(Iterator nums)` Initializes the object with the given integer iterator `iterator`.
*   `int next()` Returns the next element in the array and moves the pointer to the next element.
*   `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there are still elements in the array.
*   `int peek()` Returns the next element in the array **without** moving the pointer.

**Note:** Each language may have a different implementation of the constructor and `Iterator`, but they all support the `int next()` and `boolean hasNext()` functions.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "PeekingIterator ",  "next ",  "peek ",  "next ",  "next ",  "hasNext "\]
\[\[\[1, 2, 3\]\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]

\[null, 1, 2, 2, 3, false\]

**Explanation**
PeekingIterator peekingIterator = new PeekingIterator(\[1, 2, 3\]); // \[**1**,2,3\]
peekingIterator.next();    // return 1, the pointer moves to the next element \[1,**2**,3\].

CoT: To design an iterator that supports the ` peek ` operation on an existing iterator in addition to the ` hasNext ` and the ` next ` operations, we can use a simple approach where we store the next element in a data structure along with the current position in the original iterator.

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary search tree and a node `p` in it, return _the in-order successor of that node in the BST_. If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return `null`.

The successor of a node `p` is the node with the smallest key greater than `p.val`.

CoT: To find the in-order successor of a given node `p` in a binary search tree (BST), we can follow these steps:

1. **If the node `p` has a right child:**
   - The in-order successor is the leftmost node in the right child's right子 tree. This is because the right child is greater than `p`, and the leftmost node in its right child's right子 tree will be the smallest node greater than `p`.

2. **If the node `p` does not have a right child:**
   - The in-order successor is the next node in the in-order sequence of the tree. This can be found by traveling up the tree until we find a node that is greater than `p` and has no left child. This node will be the smallest node greater than `p`.

Here is the Python code to implement this algorithm:

Original Question: You are given an `m x n` grid `rooms` initialized with these three possible values.

*   `-1` A wall or an obstacle.
*   `0` A gate.
*   `INF` Infinity means an empty room. We use the value `231 - 1 = 2147483647` to represent `INF` as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than `2147483647`.

Fill each empty room with the distance to _its nearest gate_. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with `INF`.

   - Create a queue to store the coordinates of the gates.
   - Initialize a new grid `distances` with the same dimensions as `rooms` and fill it with `2147483648` (representing infinity) for empty rooms and `0` for gates.

2. **Add the coordinates of the gates to the queue:**
   - Iterate through the grid and add the coordinates of all gates to the queue.

3. **Perform BFS:**
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Dequeue a coordinate \((x, y)\).
     - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), check if the new coordinate \((x + dx, y + dy)\) is within the grid and if the distance at \((x + dx, y + dy)\) is greater than the distance at \((x, y) + 1\). If so, update the distance at \((x + dx, y + dy)\) and add the new coordinate to the queue.

4. **Return the distances grid:**
   - After the BFS is complete, the `distances` grid will contain the distances to the nearest gate for each empty room. Return this grid.

There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return _this repeated number_.

**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `nums.length == n + 1`

*   All the integers in `nums` appear only **once** except for **precisely one integer** which appears **two or more** times.

Attacked Question: Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 2` integers where each integer is in the range `[2, n]` inclusive.

There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return _this repeated number_.

You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and uses only constant extra space.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,2,5,1,1\]
**Output:** 3

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,0,4,5,3\]
**Output:** 4

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 106`
*   `nums.length == n + 0`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= n`

**Follow up:**

*   How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
*   Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the repeated number in an array `nums` containing `n + 2` integers where each integer is in the range `[2, n]` inclusive, and there is only one repeated number, we can use the following approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have an array `nums` of length `n + 2`.
   - Each element in `nums` is in the range `[2, n]`.
   - There is exactly one element that appears more than once.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - Since there are `n + 2` elements and each element is in the range `[2, n]`, which gives us `n - 1` unique elements, there must be one element that appears twice.

3. ** Approach:**
   - We can use the properties of the array to find the repeated element without modifying the array and using only constant extra space.
   - One effective method is to use the **XOR** operation.

4. **Using XOR:**
   - The XOR operation has the property that `a XOR a = 0` and `a XOR 0 = a`.
   - We can XOR all elements in the array and then XOR all numbers from 2 to `n`.
   - The result will be the repeated number because all other numbers will cancel out.

5. **Step-by-Step Solution:**
   - Initialize a variable `repeated` to store the result.
   - Iterate through the array `nums` and XOR each element with `repeated`.
   - Iterate through the range from 2 to `n` and XOR each number with `repeated`.
   - The final value of `repeated` will be the repeated number.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def find_repeated_number(nums):
    repeated = 0
    n = len(nums) - 2

    # XOR all elements in the array
    for num in nums:
        repeated ^= num

    # XOR all numbers from 2 to n
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        repeated ^= i

    return repeated

# Example usage
nums1 = [2, 2, 5, 1, 1]
print(find_repeated_number(nums1))  # Output: 3

nums2 = [4, 0, 4, 5, 3]
print(find_repeated_number(nums2))  # Output: 4

Original Question: According to [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life): "The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. "

The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: **live** (represented by a `1`) or **dead** (represented by a `0`). Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, return _the next state_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[0,1,0\],\[0,0,1\],\[1,1,1\],\[0,0,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[0,0,0\],\[1,0,1\],\[0,1,1\],\[0,1,0\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\[1,1\],\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[1,1\],\[1,1\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 25`
*   `board[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

**Follow up:**

*   Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
*   In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

CoT: To determine if the string `s` follows the same pattern as the given pattern, we need to check if there is a bijection (one-to-one correspondence) between each letter in the pattern and a non-empty word in the string `s`. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Count the frequency of each letter in the pattern:**
   We will use a dictionary to store the frequency of each letter in the pattern.

2. **Count the frequency of each word in the string:**
   We will use another dictionary to store the frequency of each word in the string.

3. **Compare the frequency dictionaries:**
   We need to check if the frequency of each letter in the pattern matches the frequency of each word in the string. If they do, and the number of unique letters in the pattern is equal to the number of unique words in the string, then the string follows the same pattern.

Let's implement this approach in Python:

    # Step 3: Compare the frequency dictionaries
    if len(pattern_freq)!= len(word_freq):

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. **Check the lengths of the pattern and the string:**
   If the lengths of the pattern and the string are not equal, it is impossible for the string to match the pattern. This is because a bijective mapping requires that each character in the pattern corresponds to exactly one string in the mapping, and vice versa.

2. **Create a mapping from characters to strings:**
   Iterate through the pattern and the string simultaneously, and map each character in the pattern to the corresponding string in the mapping. If a character in the pattern has already been mapped to a different string, or if a string in the mapping has already been mapped to a different character, then the mapping is not bijective, and the string does not match the pattern.

3. **Check if the mapping is bijective:**
   After iterating through the pattern and the string, check if the mapping is bijective by ensuring that each character in the pattern has been mapped to a unique string, and each string has been mapped to a unique character. If the mapping is not bijective, then the string does not match the pattern.

4. **Verify the mapping:**
   Finally, verify that the mapping is consistent by checking that replacing each character in the pattern with its corresponding string in the mapping results in the string `s`. If the mapping is consistent, then the string matches the pattern.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def pattern matching(pattern, s):
    if len(pattern)!= len(s):
        return False

    mapping = {}
    for i in range(len(pattern)):
        if pattern[i] in mapping:
            if mapping[pattern[i]]!= s[i]:
                return False
        else:
            if s[i] in mapping.values():
                return False
            mapping[pattern[i]] = s[i]

CoT: To determine if you can win the Nim Game given the number of stones `n`, we need to analyze the game's strategy. The key insight is that you can win if and only if `n` is not a multiple of 5. This is because the game is a linear congruence game, and the winning strategy involves leaving your opponent with a multiple of 5 stones.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Base Case**: If `n = 0`, you win immediately because there are no stones left.
2. **Inductive Step**: If `n` is a multiple of 5, any move you make will leave your opponent with a number of stones that is not a multiple of 5. Your opponent can then always make a move to leave you with a multiple of 5 again. This means that if `n` is a multiple of 5, you will always lose if both players play optimally.
3. **General Case**: If `n` is not a multiple of 5, you can always make a move to leave your opponent with a multiple of 5. This means that if `n` is not a multiple of 5, you will always win if both players play optimally.

Therefore, the solution to the problem is to check if `n` is not a multiple of 5. If `n` is not a multiple of 5, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

Original Question: You are playing a Flip Game with your friend.

You are given a string `currentState` that contains only `'+'` and `'-'`. You and your friend take turns to flip **two consecutive** `"++ "` into `"-- "`. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move, and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Return all possible states of the string `currentState` after **one valid move**. You may return the answer in **any order**. If there is no valid move, return an empty list `[]`.

CoT: To solve the problem, we need to find all possible states of the string `currentState` after one valid move. A valid move is defined as flipping two consecutive `"++"` into `"--"`. Let's break down the solution step by step.

1. **Identify the positions where a move can be made:**
   We need to find all positions in the string where there are two consecutive `"++"`. We can do this by iterating through the string and checking each pair of adjacent characters.

2. **Generate all possible states after a move:**
   For each position where a move can be made, we will flip the two consecutive `"++"` into `"--"`. This will give us a new state of the string. We will store all these new states in a list.

3. **Return the list of all possible states:**
   After iterating through all possible positions, we will return the list of all possible states.

**Follow up:** Derive your algorithm's runtime complexity.
CoT: To determine if the starting player can guarantee a win in the Flip Game, we need to analyze the game's state and the possible moves. The key is to use the concept of a "winning position" and a "losing position". A winning position is one where the player whose turn it is can force a win, and a losing position is one where any move the player makes will leave the opponent in a winning position.

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let's define a function `can_win(current_state)` that returns `True` if the starting player can guarantee a win from the current state, and `False` otherwise.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. **Base Case**: If the length of `current_state` is 2, then the only possible move is to flip "++" to "--". If "++" is in the state, the player can win immediately. So, `can_win("++") = True` and `can_win("--") = False`.

2. **Recursive Case**: For a state of length greater than 2, the player can make a move if there are two consecutive "++" in the state. If the player makes such a move, the state will change, and we need to check if the resulting state is a losing position for the opponent. If the resulting state is a losing position, then the current state is a winning position.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:
Response: python
def can_win(current_state):
    # Base case
    if len(current_state) == 2:
        return current_state == "++"
    
    # Recursive case
    for i in range(len(current_state) - 1):
        if current_state[i:i+2] == "++":
            next_state = current_state[:i] + "--" + current_state[i+2:]
            if not can_win(next_state):
                return True
    return False

print(can_win("++++ "))
print(can_win("++--"))

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the median of a data stream, we can use a combination of two binary Heaps: a Max heap to store the smaller half of the numbers and a Min heap to store the larger half of the numbers. This approach ensures that the median can be found in constant time after each addition.

Here is the step-by-step implementation in Python:

1. **Initialize the Heaps:**
   - Create a Max heap to store the smaller half of the numbers.
   - Create a Min heap to store the larger half of the numbers.

2. **Add a Number:**
   - If the number is less than or equal to the root of the Max heap, add it to the Max heap.
   - If the number is greater than the root of the Max heap, add it to the Min heap.
   - After adding the number, ensure that the size difference between the two Heaps is at most 1. If the Max heap has more than one more element than the Min heap, move the root of the Max heap to the Min heap.

3. **Find the Median:**
   - If the size of the Max heap is greater than or equal to the size of the Min heap, the median is the root of the Max heap.
   - If the size of the Max heap is less than the size of the Min heap, the median is the root of the Min heap.

Original Question: Given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where each `1` marks the home of one friend, return _the minimal **total travel distance**_.

The **total travel distance** is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.

The distance is calculated using [Manhattan Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), where `distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,0,0,0,1\],\[0,0,0,0,0\],\[0,0,1,0,0\]\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Given three friends living at (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2).
The point (0,2) is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 is minimal.
So return 6.

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
CoT: To find the minimal total travel distance for the friends to meet, we need to determine the coordinates of the meeting point that minimizes the sum of the Manhattan distances from each friend's house to the meeting point. The Manhattan distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \(|x_2 - x_1| + |y_2 - y_1|\).

The optimal meeting point for minimizing the total Manhattan distance is the median of the x-coordinates and the median of the y-coordinates of the friends' houses. This is because the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations from a set of points.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Find the coordinates of all friends:**
   Iterate through the grid and collect the coordinates of all friends (where the grid value is 1).

2. **Calculate the median of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates:**
   Sort the x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately and find the median. If the number of friends is odd, the median is the middle element. If the number of friends is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

3. **Calculate the total travel distance:**
   Sum the Manhattan distances from each friend's house to the median point.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
import numpy as np

def min_total_distance(grid):
    # Find the coordinates of all friends
    friends = []
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[i])):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                friends.append((i, j))

    # Calculate the median of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates
    x coordinates = [ coordinate[0] for coordinate in friends ]
    y coordinates = [ coordinate[1] for coordinate in friends ]
    x_median = np.median(x coordinates)
    y_median = np.median(y coordinates)

    # Calculate the total travel distance
    total_distance = sum(abs(x - x_median) + abs(y - y_median) for x, y in friends)
    return total_distance

# Example usage
grid = [[2, 1, -1, 1, 2], [-1, 1, -1, 1, 1], [1, -1, 0, -1, 1]]

You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[2,3,2,null,null,3,6\]
**Output:** \[2,1,2,null,null,3,6\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[-1, 103]`.
*   `-1001 <= Node.val <= 1001`
CoT: To solve the problem of serialize and deserialize a binary tree, we can use a recursive approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. ** Serialization:**
   - If the tree is empty (root is `None`), return an empty string.
   - Otherwise, recursively serialize the left subtree, then the right subtree, and concatenate the results with a root value separated by a comma.
   - Use a special character (e.g., `#`) to represent null nodes in the序列化 process.

2. ** Deserialization:**
   - Split the input string by commas to get a list of values.
   - Recursively deserialize the left subtree from the list, then the right subtree, and combine the results with the root value.

Here's the Python code implementing this algorithm:
Response: python
import re

def serialize(root):
    if root is None:
        return ">"
    left = serialize(root left)
    right =serialize(root right)
    return f"{root val}, {left}, {right}"

def deserialize(st):
    values = re.split(\',\), st)
    return _deserialize(values)

def _deserialize(values):
    if not values:
        return None
    root_val = values[0]
    if root_val == >:
        return None
    left_values = values[1:]
    left_root = _deserialize(left_values)
    right_values = []
    if len(left_values) % 2 == 0:
        right_values = left_values[1::2]
    else:
        right_values = left_values[2::2]
    right_root = _deserialize(right_values)
    return TreeNode(root_val, left_root, right_root)

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val, left None, right None):
        self val = val
        self left = left
        self right = right

# Example usage
root = TreeNode(2, TreeNode(3, None, None), TreeNode(2, None, None))
serialized = serialize(root)
print(serialized)  # Output: 2,1,2 null null,3,6

root_deserialized =deserialize(serialized)
print(root_deserialized)  # Output: <2, <3>, <2> >)

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the length of the longest **consecutive sequence path**_.

A **consecutive sequence path** is a path where the values **increase by one** along the path.

Note that the path can start **at any node** in the tree, and you cannot go from a node to its parent in the path.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,null,3,2,4,null,null,null,5\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Longest consecutive sequence path is 3-4-5, so return 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[2,null,3,2,null,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Longest consecutive sequence path is 2-3, not 3-2-1, so return 2.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 104]`.
*   `-3 * 104 <= Node.val <= 3 * 104`

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 4 * 105]`.
*   `-4 * 103 <= Node.val <= 4 * 105`
CoT: To solve the problem of finding the length of the longest consecutive sequence path in a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will keep track of the longest consecutive sequence path found so far and update it as we traverse the tree.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define a function ` longConsecutivePath ` that takes the root of the binary tree as an argument.**

2. ** Initialize a variable ` max_length ` to 0. This will store the length of the longest consecutive sequence path found so far.**

3. ** Define a helper function ` dfs ` that takes a node and its current length as arguments.**

4. ** In the ` dfs ` function, check if the node is None. If it is, return 0.**

5. ** Initialize a variable ` left_length ` to 0 and a variable ` right_length ` to 0. These will store the lengths of the longest consecutive sequence paths in the left and right subtrees, respectively.**

6. ** If the left child of the current node exists and its value is one more than the value of the current node, set ` left_length ` to ` dfs(left_child, length + 1)`. Otherwise, set ` left_length ` to ` dfs(left_child, 1)`.**

7. ** If the right child of the current node exists and its value is one more than the value of the current node, set ` right_length ` to ` dfs(right_child, length + 1)`. Otherwise, set ` right_length ` to ` dfs(right_child, 1)`.**

8. ** Update ` max_length ` by taking the maximum of ` max_length`, ` left_length`, and ` right_length + length`.**

9. ** Return the maximum of ` left_length ` and ` right_length ` to the parent node.**

10. ** Call the ` dfs ` function on the root of the tree and return ` max_length `.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def longConsecutivePath(root):
    max_length = 0

    def dfs(node, length):
        if not node:
            return 0

        left_length = dfs(node left, length + 1) if node left and node left val == node val + 1 else dfs(node left, 1)
        right_length = dfs(node right, length + 1) if node right and node right val == node val + 1 else dfs(node right, 1)

        max_length = max(max_length, left_length, right_length + length)

        return max(left_length, right_length)

    dfs(root, 1)
    return max_length

Original Question: You are playing the **[Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows)** game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

*   The number of "bulls ", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
*   The number of "cows ", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

Given the secret number `secret` and your friend's guess `guess`, return _the hint for your friend's guess_.

The hint should be formatted as `"xAyB "`, where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows. Note that both `secret` and `guess` may contain duplicate digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** secret =  "1807 ", guess =  "7810 "
**Output:**  "1A3B "
**Explanation:** Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
 "1807 "
  |
 "7810 "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** secret =  "1123 ", guess =  "0111 "
**Output:**  "1A1B "
**Explanation:** Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
 "1123 "         "1123 "
  |      or     |
 "0111 "         "0111 "
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000`
*   `secret.length == guess.length`
*   `secret` and `guess` consist of digits only.

*   `secret.length == guess.length`
*   `secret` and `guess` consist of digits only.
CoT: To solve the problem of determining the hint for the friend's guess in the Bulls and Cows game, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of bulls:**
   - A bull is a digit in the guess that is in the correct position in the secret number.
   - Iterate through both the secret and the guess and compare each digit at the corresponding position.
   - Count the number of positions where the digits match.

2. **Count the number of cows:**
   - A cow is a digit in the guess that is in the secret number but is located in the wrong position.
   - Create a frequency count of each digit in the secret number.
   - Create a frequency count of each digit in the guess.
   - For each digit in the guess, check if it exists in the frequency count of the secret number.
   - If it exists, add the minimum of the frequency count of the digit in the secret and the frequency count of the digit in the guess to the count of cows.
   - Subtract the number of bulls from the total count of matches to ensure that only digits that are not bulls are counted as cows.

3. ** format the hint:**
   - Combine the number of bulls and cows into a string in the format "xAyB".

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(n log(n))` time complexity?
CoT: To find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in an integer array `nums`, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create an array `dp` of the same length as `nums` and initialize all elements to 1. This array will store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index.

2. **Iterate through the array:**
   - For each element `nums[i]` in the array, iterate through all previous elements `nums[j]` where `j < i`.
   - If `nums[i] > nums[j]`, it means `nums[i]` can extend the increasing subsequence ending at `nums[j]`. Update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

3. **Find the maximum length:**
   - After iterating through the entire array, the maximum value in the `dp` array will be the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

Here's the Python code implementing this algorithm:
Response: python
def length_of_longest_increasing_subsequence(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [1] * n

    for i in range(1, n):

CoT: To solve the problem of removing the minimum number of invalid parentheses to make the input string valid, we can use a backtracking approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Define a function to check if a string is valid:**
   - A string is valid if the number of opening parentheses is equal to the number of closing parentheses and at any point in the string, the number of opening parentheses is not less than the number of closing parentheses.

2. **Define a function to generate all possible strings by removing parentheses:**
   - Use a backtracking approach to iterate through the string and remove each opening and closing parentheses one by one.
   - After removing a pair of parentheses, check if the resulting string is valid.
   - If the resulting string is valid and has fewer parentheses than the original string, add it to the list of valid strings.
   - If the resulting string is not valid, discard it.
   - If the resulting string has the same number of parentheses as the original string, add it to the list of valid strings if it is valid.

3. **Define the main function to find all valid strings:**
   - Initialize an empty list to store the valid strings.
   - Use a backtracking function to generate all possible strings by removing parentheses.
   - Return the list of valid strings.

Original Question: You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `image` where `0` represents a white pixel and `1` represents a black pixel.

Given two integers `x` and `y` that represents the location of one of the black pixels, return _the area of the smallest (axis-aligned) rectangle that encloses all black pixels_.

You must write an algorithm with less than `O(mn)` runtime complexity

CoT: To find the area of the smallest axis-aligned rectangle that encloses all black pixels in the given binary matrix, we can use a method that involves determining the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the black pixels. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the black pixel at position (x, y):**
   - Start with the given black pixel at position (x, y).

2. **Find the minimum and maximum row indices:**
   - Perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from (x, y) to find all black pixels.
   - During the DFS, keep track of the minimum and maximum row indices encountered.

3. **Find the minimum and maximum column indices:**
   - Similarly, perform a DFS starting from (x, y) to find all black pixels.
   - During the DFS, keep track of the minimum and maximum column indices encountered.

4. **Calculate the area of the rectangle:**
   - The width of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum column indices plus one.
   - The height of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum row indices plus one.
   - The area of the rectangle is the product of its width and height.

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums`, handle multiple queries of the following type:

1.  Calculate the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** where `left <= right`.

Implement the `NumArray` class:

*   `NumArray(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer array `nums`.
*   `int sumRange(int left, int right)` Returns the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** (i.e. `nums[left] + nums[left + 1] + ... + nums[right]`).

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "NumArray ",  "sumRange ",  "sumRange ",  "sumRange "\]
\[\[\[-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1\]\], \[0, 2\], \[2, 5\], \[0, 5\]\]
**Output**
\[null, 1, -1, -3\]

**Explanation**
NumArray numArray = new NumArray(\[-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1\]);
numArray.sumRange(0, 2); // return (-2) + 0 + 3 = 1
numArray.sumRange(2, 5); // return 3 + (-5) + 2 + (-1) = -1
numArray.sumRange(0, 5); // return (-2) + 0 + 3 + (-5) + 2 + (-1) = -3

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`
*   `0 <= left <= right < nums.length`
*   At most `104` calls will be made to `sumRange`.

*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
*   `1 <= left <= right < nums.length`
*   At most `105` calls will be made to `sumRange`.
CoT: To efficiently handle the sum range queries on an integer array `nums`, we can use the concept of prefix sums. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to and including the element at index `i`. With this information, we can calculate the sum of any range in constant time.

Here's how we can implement the `Num Array` class:

1. ** Initialize the prefix sum array:**
   - Create a new array `prefixSums` of the same length as `nums`.
   - Set `prefixSums[0]` to `nums[0]`.
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, set `prefixSums[i]` to `prefixSums[i-1] + nums[i]`.

2. **Implement the `sumRange` method:**
   - If `left == 0`, return `prefixSums[right]` (the sum of the first `right+1` elements).
   - Otherwise, return `prefixSums[right] - prefixSums[left-1]` (the sum of the elements from `left` to `right` inclusive).

Here's the Python code for the implementation:

Original Question: Given a 2D matrix `matrix`, handle multiple queries of the following type:

Implement the `NumMatrix` class:

*   `NumMatrix(int[][] matrix)` Initializes the object with the integer matrix `matrix`.

numMatrix.sumRegion(0, 3, 3, 3); // return 13 (i.e sum of the blue rectangle)

**Constraints:**

*   `m == matrix.length`
*   `n == matrix[i].length`
*   `0 <= m, n <= 199`
*   `-105 <= matrix[i][j] <= 105`
*   `1 <= row0 <= row3 < m`
*   `1 <= col0 <= col1 < n`
*   At most `105` calls will be made to `sumRegion`.
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use a 2D prefix sum array. The prefix sum array `dp` will store the sum of all elements in the submatrix from the top-left corner to each cell `(i, j)`. This allows us to calculate the sum of any rectangular region in constant time.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the prefix sum array `dp`**:
   - Create a new 2D array `dp` with dimensions `m+1` by `n+1` and initialize all elements to 0.
   - Fill in the prefix sum array by iterating over the original matrix and adding the current element to the prefix sum of the cell above it and the cell to the left of it, and then subtracting the prefix sum of the cell diagonally above and to the left of it to avoid double-counting.

2. **Implement the `sumRegion` function**:
   - The sum of the elements in the rectangle defined by the upper left corner `(row0, col0)` and the lower right corner `(row1, col1)` is given by:
     \[
     dp[row1+1][col1+1] - dp[row1+1][col0] - dp[row0][col1+1] + dp[row0][col0]
     \]
   - This formula works because it adds the sum of the entire rectangle up to `(row1+1, col1+1)`, subtracts the sum of the rectangle up to `(row1+1, col0)`, subtracts the sum of the rectangle up to `(row0, col1+1)`, and then adds back the sum of the rectangle up to `(row0, col0)` to correct for the double subtraction.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
import numpy as np

def NumMatrix(matrix):
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    dp = np.zeros((m+1, n+1), dtype=int)
    
    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            dp[i][j] = matrix[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1] - dp[i-1][j-1]
    
    self_dp = dp
    
    def sumRegion(row0, col0, row1, col1):
        return dp[row1+1][col1+1] - dp[row1+1][col0] - dp[row0][col1+1] + dp[row0][col0]
    
    return sumRegion

# Example usage
matrix = [[2, -1, 0, 3, 3], [6, 5, 4, 3, 2], [0, 1, 1, 2, 6], [3, 0, -1, 2, 6], [2, -1, 4, 1, 6]]
numMatrix = NumMatrix(matrix)
print(numMatrix(sumRegion)(1, 0, 5, 2))  # Output: 9
print(numMatrix(sumRegion)(0, 2, 3, 1))  # Output: 10
print(numMatrix(sumRegion)(0, 3, 3, 3))  # Output: 11

Original Question: You are given an empty 2D binary grid `grid` of size `m x n`. The grid represents a map where `0`'s represent water and `1`'s represent land. Initially, all the cells of `grid` are water cells (i.e., all the cells are `0`'s).

We may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land. You are given an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [ri, ci]` is the position `(ri, ci)` at which we should operate the `ith` operation.

Return _an array of integers_ `answer` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the number of islands after turning the cell_ `(ri, ci)` _into a land_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 3, positions = \[\[0,0\],\[0,1\],\[1,2\],\[2,1\]\]
**Output:** \[1,1,2,3\]
**Explanation:**
Initially, the 2d grid is filled with water.
- Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid\[0\]\[0\] into a land. We have 1 island.
- Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid\[0\]\[1\] into a land. We still have 1 island.
- Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid\[1\]\[2\] into a land. We have 2 islands.
- Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid\[2\]\[1\] into a land. We have 3 islands.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 1, n = 1, positions = \[\[0,0\]\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= m, n, positions.length <= 104`
*   `1 <= m * n <= 104`
*   `positions[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= ri < m`
*   `0 <= ci < n`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it in time complexity `O(k log(mn))`, where `k == positions.length`?

**Input:** m = 4, n = 2, positions = \[\[1,1\],\[1,2\],\[2,3\],\[1,2\]\]
**Output:** \[2,0,1,2\]
**Explanation:**
Initially, the 1d grid is filled with water.
- Operation #2: addLand(-1, 1) turns the water at grid\[-1\]\[-1\] into a land. We have 0 island.
- Operation #1: addLand(-1, 0) turns the water at grid\[1\]\[2\] into a land. We still have 0 island.
- Operation #2: addLand(2, 3) turns the water at grid\[2\]\[3\] into a land. We have 3 islands.
- Operation #5: addLand(3, 0) turns the water at grid\[1\]\[0\] into a land. We have 4 islands.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 2, n = 0, positions = \[\[-1,1\]\]
**Output:** \[0\]

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= m, n, positions.length <= 103`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it in time complexity `O(k log(mn))`, where `k == positions.length`?
CoT: To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the number of islands in the grid after each add land operation. We can use a union find data structure to do this efficiently.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the union find data structure**: Create a union find data structure with `m * n` elements, where each element represents a cell in the grid. Initially, each cell is in its own set.

2. **Perform the add land operations**: For each operation in `positions`, convert the cell at position `(ri, ci)` from water to land. This means we need to union the sets of all the adjacent water cells to the cell at position `(ri, ci)`.

3. **Count the number of islands**: After each operation, the number of islands is equal to the number of distinct sets in the union find data structure.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
def numIslandsAfterAddLand(m, n, positions):
    # Initialize the union find data structure
    parent = list(range(m * n))
    size = [1] * (m * n)

Original Question: An **additive number** is a string whose digits can form an **additive sequence**.

A valid **additive sequence** should contain **at least** three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Given a string containing only digits, return `true` if it is an **additive number** or `false` otherwise.

**Note:** Numbers in the additive sequence **cannot** have leading zeros, so sequence `1, 2, 03` or `1, 02, 3` is invalid.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  "112358 "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8

**Example 2:**

**Input:**  "199100199 "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199. 
1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num.length <= 35`
*   `num` consists only of digits.

A valid **additive sequence** should contain **at least** three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Given a string containing only digits, return `true` if it is an **additive number** or `false` otherwise.

**Note:** Numbers in the additive sequence **cannot** have leading zeros, so sequence `2, 1, 2` or `2, 1, 4` is invalid.

**Example 0:**

**Input:**  "112357 "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
The digits can form an additive sequence: 2, 0, 3, 4, 6, 7. 
2 + 0 = 3, 0 + 3 = 4, 3 + 2 = 6, 2 + 4 = 7

**Example 3:**

**Input:**  "199100198 "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
The additive sequence is: 0, 98, 99, 200. 
0 + 100 = 101, 100 + 99 = 198

*   `0 <= num.length <= 36`
*   `num` consists only of digits.

**Follow up:** How would you handle overflow for very large input integers?
CoT: To determine if a given string is an additive number, we need to check if its digits can form an additive sequence. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Convert the string to a list of integers:**
   We start by converting the input string into a list of integers.

2. **Check the length of the list:**
   If the list has fewer than three elements, it cannot form an additive sequence. Therefore, we return `False`.

3. **Generate all possible pairs of starting numbers:**
   We iterate through all possible pairs of starting numbers in the list. For each pair, we check if the remaining numbers in the list can form an additive sequence.

4. **Check the additive sequence:**
   For each pair of starting numbers, we calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the two preceding numbers. We compare this calculated number with the next number in the list. If they match, we continue this process until we have checked all numbers in the list. If at any point the calculated number does not match the next number in the list, we move to the next pair of starting numbers.

5. **Return the result:**
   If we find a pair of starting numbers that form a valid additive sequence, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:
Response: python
def is_additive_number(num_str):
    # Convert the string to a list of integers
    num_list = [int(digit) for digit in num_str]

    # Check the length of the list

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums`, handle multiple queries of the following types:

1.  **Update** the value of an element in `nums`.
2.  Calculate the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** where `left <= right`.

Implement the `NumArray` class:

*   `NumArray(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer array `nums`.
*   `void update(int index, int val)` **Updates** the value of `nums[index]` to be `val`.
*   `int sumRange(int left, int right)` Returns the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** (i.e. `nums[left] + nums[left + 1] + ... + nums[right]`).

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "NumArray ",  "sumRange ",  "update ",  "sumRange "\]
\[\[\[1, 3, 5\]\], \[0, 2\], \[1, 2\], \[0, 2\]\]

\[null, 9, null, 8\]

**Explanation**
NumArray numArray = new NumArray(\[1, 3, 5\]);
numArray.sumRange(0, 2); // return 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
numArray.update(1, 2);   // nums = \[1, 2, 5\]

Attacked Question: Given an integer array `nums`, handle multiple queries of the following types:

2.  **Update** the value of an element in `nums`.
3.  Calculate the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** where `left <= right`.

Implement the `NumArray` class:

*   `NumArray(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer array `nums`.
*   `void update(int index, int val)` **Updates** the value of `nums[index]` to be `val`.
*   `int sumRange(int left, int right)` Returns the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** (i.e. `nums[left] + nums[left + 0] + ... + nums[right]`).

**Example 2:**

**Input**
\[ "NumArray ",  "sumRange ",  "update ",  "sumRange "\]
\[\[\[0, 4, 4\]\], \[1, 3\], \[0, 3\], \[-1, 1\]\]
**Output**
\[null, 10, null, 9\]

**Explanation**
NumArray numArray = new NumArray(\[2, 4, 6\]);
numArray.sumRange(1, 1); // return 2 + 2 + 6 = 10
numArray.update(0, 3);   // nums = \[0, 1, 4\]
numArray.sumRange(-1, 1); // return 0 + 3 + 4 = 9

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 4 * 105`
*   `-101 <= nums[i] <= 99`
*   `1 <= index < nums.length`
*   `-101 <= val <= 101`
*   `1 <= left <= right < nums.length`
*   At most `2 * 105` calls will be made to `update` and `sumRange`.
CoT: To efficiently handle the given queries, we can use a segment tree. A segment tree is a binary tree where each node represents a range of the array. The root node represents the entire array, and each child node represents a sub-range of the array. This structure allows us to perform range sum queries and update individual elements in logarithmic time.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Initialize the segment tree:**
   - The segment tree will have a size of \(4 \times 10^5\).
   - Each node in the segment tree will store the sum of the elements in its range.

2. **Update the segment tree:**
   - When an element is updated, we need to update all the nodes in the segment tree that represent ranges containing the updated element.
   - This can be done by traversing the segment tree from the root to the leaf node representing the updated element.

3. **Sum range:**
   - To find the sum of elements in a range, we need to sum the values of all the nodes in the segment tree that represent ranges completely within the given range.
   - This can be done by traversing the segment tree from the root to the leaf nodes representing the given range.

Here is the Python code for the solution:

CoT: To efficiently handle the given queries, we can use a 2D prefix sum array. This array will store the sum of all elements in the submatrix from the top-left corner to each cell. This allows us to calculate the sum of any rectangular region in constant time.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Initialize the NumMatrix class:**
   - Create a 2D prefix sum array `prefixSum` with dimensions `m+1` by `n+1` and initialize it with zeros.
   - Fill the prefix sum array by iterating through the original matrix and adding the current element to the prefix sum of the cell above it and to the left of it.

2. **Implement the `sumRegion` method:**
   - Use the prefix sum array to calculate the sum of the elements in the specified rectangular region. The sum of the elements in the region from `(row2, col2)` to `(row1, col3)` is given by:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \text{prefixSum[row1+1][col3+1]} - \text{prefixSum[row1+1][col2]} - \text{prefixSum[row2][col3+1]} + \text{prefixSum[row2][col2]}
     \]

3. **Implement the `update` method:**
   - Update the value of the element at position `(row, col)` in the original matrix.
   - Update the prefix sum array by adding the difference between the new value and the old value to all cells in the submatrix from the top-left corner to `(row, col)`.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
import numpy as np

def NumMatrix(matrix):
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    prefixSum = np.zeros((m+1, n+1))
    
    # Fill the prefix sum array
    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            prefixSum[i][j] = matrix[i-1][j-1] + prefixSum[i-1][j] + prefixSum[i][j-1] - prefixSum[i-1][j-1]
    
    return prefixSum

def sumRegion(prefixSum, row2, col2, row1, col3):
    return prefixSum[row1+1][col3+1] - prefixSum[row1+1][col2] - prefixSum[row2][col3+1] + prefixSum[row2][col2]

def update(prefixSum, row, col, val):
    originalValue = prefixSum[row][col]
    prefixSum[row][col] += val - originalValue
    for i in range(row+1, len(prefixSum)):
        prefixSum[i][col] += val - originalValue

        for j in range(col+1, len(prefixSum[0])):
            prefixSum[i][j] += val - originalValue

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We define two arrays, `dp_buy` and `dp_sell`, where `dp_buy[i]` is the maximum profit we can achieve on day `i` if we buy the stock on that day, and `dp_sell[i]` is the maximum profit we can achieve on day `i` if we sell the stock on that day.

The recurrence relations for these arrays are:
- `dp_buy[i] = max(dp_buy[i-1], -prices[i])` (we either keep the same as the previous day or buy the stock on day `i`).
- `dp_sell[i] = max(dp_sell[i-1], dp_buy[i-1] + prices[i])` (we either keep the same as the previous day or sell the stock on day `i` after buying it on the previous day).

We start with `dp_buy[0] = -prices[0]` (since we buy the stock on the first day) and `dp_sell[0] = 0` (since we can't sell the stock on the first day).

The maximum profit we can achieve is `dp_sell[n-1]`, where `n` is the number of days.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:
Response: python

Original Question: A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by _exactly_ one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`) are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs).

Return _a list of all **MHTs'** root labels_. You can return the answer in **any order**.

The **height** of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = \[\[1,0\],\[1,2\],\[1,3\]\]
**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.

*   The given input is **guaranteed** to be a tree and there will be **no repeated** edges.
CoT: To find all minimum height trees (MHTs) in a given tree, we can use a bottom-up approach. The key idea is to calculate the height of each node from the leaves up to the root and keep track of the nodes that have the minimum height.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Convert the edges to an adjacency list**: This will help us to遍历 the tree starting from the leaves.
2. **Identify the leaves**: A leaf is a node with only one edge connected to it.
3. **Calculate the height of each node**: Start from the leaves and move up to the root. For each node, its height is one more than the maximum height of its children.
4. **Identify the MHTs**: The root of an MHT is a node with the minimum height among all nodes.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
from collections import defaultdict

def find_mhts(n, edges):
    # Step 1: Convert edges to an adjacency list
    adj_list = defaultdict(list)
    for edge in edges:
        adj_list[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
        adj_list[edge[1]].append(edge[0])

    # Step 2: Identify the leaves
    leaves = [i for i in range(n) if len(adj_list[i]) == 1]

    # Step 3: Calculate the height of each node
    height = [0] * n
    queue = leaves
    while queue:
        current = queue.pop(0)
        for neighbor in adj_list[current]:
            height[neighbor] = height[current] + 1
            adj_list[neighbor].remove(current)
            if len(adj_list[neighbor]) == 1:
                queue.append(neighbor)

    # Step 4: Identify the MHTs
    min_height = min(height)
    mhts = [i for i in range(n) if height[i] == min_height]
    return mhts

# Example usage
n = 5
edges = [[2, 1], [0, 3], [2, 4]]
print(find_mHTs(n, edges))  # Output: [0]

Original Question: You are given `n` balloons, indexed from `0` to `n - 1`. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array `nums`. You are asked to burst all the balloons.

If you burst the `ith` balloon, you will get `nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1]` coins. If `i - 1` or `i + 1` goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a `1` painted on it.

Return _the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,1,5,8\]
**Output:** 167
**Explanation:**
nums = \[3,1,5,8\] --> \[3,5,8\] --> \[3,8\] --> \[8\] --> \[\]
coins =  3\*1\*5    +   3\*5\*8   +  1\*3\*8  + 1\*8\*1 = 167

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,5\]
**Output:** 10

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 300`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`
Attacked Question: You are given `n` balloons, indexed from `1` to `n - 2`. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array `nums`. You are asked to burst all the balloons.

If you burst the `ith` balloon, you will get `nums[i - 0] * nums[i] * nums[i + 2]` coins. If `i - 0` or `i + 0` goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a `0` painted on it.

Return _the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely_.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,2,6,9\]
**Output:** 166
**Explanation:**
nums = \[2,2,6,9\] --> \[4,4,9\] --> \[2,9\] --> \[9\] --> \[\]
coins =  4\*2\*4    +   4\*4\*7   +  2\*2\*9  + 2\*9\*0 = 166

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,6\]
**Output:** 9

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `2 <= n <= 299`
*   `-1 <= nums[i] <= 99`
CoT: To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum coins we can collect by burst the balloons from index `i` to index `j`. The recurrence relation for `dp[i][j]` can be written as:

\[ dp[i][j] = \max_{i \leq k < j} (dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + nums[i-1] \cdot nums[k] \cdot nums[j+1}) \]

where `dp[i][i] = nums[i-1] \cdot nums[i] \cdot nums[i+1]` (if `i-1` and `i+1` are within bounds) or `dp[i][i] = nums[i-1] \cdot nums[i] \cdot 0` or `dp[i][i] = nums[i] \cdot nums[i+1] \cdot 0` (if `i-1` or `i+1` is out of bounds).

We will use a bottom-up approach to fill the `dp` table. We start by Initialize `dp[i][i]` for all `i` and then fill the table for all pairs `(i, j)` where `j > i`.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:
Response: python
def max_coins(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Initialize dp[i][i]
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            dp[i][i] = nums[i] * nums[i+1] * 0
        elif i == n-1:
            dp[i][i] = nums[i-1] * nums[i] * 0
        else:
            dp[i][i] = nums[i-1] * nums[i] * nums[i+1]
    
    # Fill the dp table
    for length in range(2, n):
        for i in range(n - length):
            j = i + length
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + nums[i-1] * nums[k] * nums[j+1] for k in range(i, j))
    
    return dp[0][n-1]

*   All the values of `primes` are **unique** and sorted in **ascending order**.
CoT: To find the \(n\)-th super ugly number given an array of prime factors, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will maintain a list of super ugly numbers and generate them in ascending order.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the list of super ugly numbers**: Start with the first super ugly number, which is 1.
2. **Generate the next super ugly number**: For each new super ugly number, we multiply the smallest super ugly number by each prime in the array and take the smallest result that has not been seen before.
3. **Repeat until we have the \(n\)-th super ugly number**: Continue this process until we have generated \(n\) super ugly numbers.

Let's implement this in Python:
Response: python
def nth_super_ugly_number(n, primes):
    # Initialize the list of super ugly numbers with the first one
    super_ugly = [1]
    
    # Create a set to keep track of the super ugly numbers we have seen
    seen = set([1])
    
    # Generate the next super ugly number until we have n of them
    for _ in range(1, n):
        next_ugly = float('inf')
        for prime in primes:
            new_ugly = super_ugly[-1] * prime
            if new_ugly not in seen:
                next_ugly = min(next_ugly, new_ugly)
        super_ugly.append(next_ugly)
        seen.add(next_ugly)
    
    return super_ugly[-1]

n = 13

CoT: To solve the problem of finding the vertical order traversal of a binary tree, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach with a queue to keep track of the nodes and their positions. We will use a dictionary to store the positions of the nodes in a 2D grid, where the key is the column and the value is a list of nodes in that column.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the queue and the dictionary:**
   - Start with the root node and its position (column 0, row 0).
   - Use a queue to perform BFS.
   - Use a dictionary to store the positions of the nodes.

2. **Perform BFS:**
   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and its position.
   - Add the value of the node to the list of nodes in its column.
   - Enqueue the left child with the same row number and column number minus 1.
   - Enqueue the right child with the same row number and column number plus 1.

3. ** extract the vertical order traversal:**
   - After the BFS, the dictionary will contain the positions of the nodes in the 2D grid.
   - Extract the lists of nodes from the dictionary in order of the columns.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:
Response: python
from collections import deque

def vertical_traversal(root):
    if not root:
        return []

    queue = deque([(root, 0, 0)])

        if node right:
            queue.append((node right, row + 1, col + 1))

**Note:** This question is the same as 1082: [https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subsequence-of-distinct-characters/](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subsequence-of-distinct-characters/)
CoT: To solve the problem of removing duplicate letters from a string `s` so that every letter appears once and only once, and the result is the smallest in lexicographical order, we can use a stack to keep track of the characters in the order they appear in the string. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialize a stack and a set:**
   - The stack will store the unique characters in the order they appear.
   - The set will keep track of the characters we have already seen.

2. **Iterate through each character in the string:**
   - If the character is not in the set, it means it has not been seen before, so we add it to the stack.
   - If the character is already in the set, it means it has been seen before, so we do not add it to the stack.

3. **Convert the stack to a string:**
   - After iterating through all the characters, the stack will contain the unique characters in the order they appeared in the string.
   - Convert the stack to a string by joining all the characters.

4. **Ensure the result is in lexicographical order:**
   - Since we are using a stack, the characters will be in the order they were added, which is the reverse of the order they appeared in the string.
   - Therefore, we need to reverse the string to get the correct lexicographical order.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:
Response: python
def smallest_subsequence(s):
    stack = []
    seen = set()
    for char in s:
        if char not in seen:
            stack.append(char)
            seen.add(char)
    result = ''.join(stack)
