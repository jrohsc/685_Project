Original Question: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,7,11,15\], target = 9
**Output:** \[0,1\]
**Explanation:** Because nums\[0\] + nums\[1\] == 9, we return \[0, 1\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,4\], target = 6
**Output:** \[1,2\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,3\], target = 6
**Output:** \[0,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `-109 <= target <= 109`
*   **Only one valid answer exists.**

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?

Original Question: Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1.  Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
2.  Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
3.  Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
4.  Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `"123 " -> 123`, `"0032 " -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
5.  If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.
6.  Return the integer as the final result.

**Note:**

*   Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.
*   **Do not ignore** any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "42 "
**Output:** 42
**Explanation:** The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1:  "42 " (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2:  "42 " (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3:  "42 " ( "42 " is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is 42.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "   -42 "
**Output:** -42
**Explanation:**
Step 1:  "   \-42 " (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2:  "   \-42 " ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3:  "   -42 " ( "42 " is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is -42.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "4193 with words "
**Output:** 4193
**Explanation:**
Step 1:  "4193 with words " (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2:  "4193 with words " (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3:  "4193 with words " ( "4193 " is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.
Since 4193 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is 4193.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length <= 200`
*   `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (`0-9`), `' '`, `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'.'`.

Original Question: Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

**Symbol**       **Value**
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

*   `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
*   `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
*   `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = 3
**Output:**  "III "
**Explanation:** 3 is represented as 3 ones.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = 58
**Output:**  "LVIII "
**Explanation:** L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** num = 1994

Attacked Question: Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

**Symbol**       **Value**
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

*   `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
*   `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
*   `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Original Question: Given the `head` of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return _the modified list_.

`k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[1,2,3,4,5\], k = 2
**Output:** \[2,1,4,3,5\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[1,2,3,4,5\], k = 3
**Output:** \[3,2,1,4,5\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
*   `1 <= k <= n <= 5000`
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

**Follow-up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra memory space?

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**. Then return _the number of unique elements in_ `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

*   Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
*   Return `k`.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array
int\[\] expectedNums = \[...\]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums\[i\] == expectedNums\[i\];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,2\]
**Output:** 2, nums = \[1,2,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4\]
**Output:** 5, nums = \[0,1,2,3,4,\_,\_,\_,\_,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
*   `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
Original Question: You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of `words` are of **the same length**.

A **concatenated substring** in `s` is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of `words` concatenated.

*   For example, if `words = [ "ab ", "cd ", "ef "]`, then `"abcdef "`, `"abefcd "`, `"cdabef "`, `"cdefab "`, `"efabcd "`, and `"efcdab "` are all concatenated strings. `"acdbef "` is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of `words`.

Return _the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in_ `s`. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  "barfoothefoobarman ", words = \[ "foo ", "bar "\]
**Output:** \[0,9\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 2 and words\[i\].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.
The substring starting at 0 is  "barfoo ". It is the concatenation of \[ "bar ", "foo "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is  "foobar ". It is the concatenation of \[ "foo ", "bar "\] which is a permutation of words.
The output order does not matter. Returning \[9,0\] is fine too.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword ", words = \[ "word ", "good ", "best ", "word "\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 4 and words\[i\].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.
There is no substring of length 16 is s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.
We return an empty array.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  "barfoofoobarthefoobarman ", words = \[ "bar ", "foo ", "the "\]
**Output:** \[6,9,12\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 3 and words\[i\].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 9.
The substring starting at 6 is  "foobarthe ". It is the concatenation of \[ "foo ", "bar ", "the "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is  "barthefoo ". It is the concatenation of \[ "bar ", "the ", "foo "\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 12 is  "thefoobar ". It is the concatenation of \[ "the ", "foo ", "bar "\] which is a permutation of words.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 104`
*   `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
*   `s` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
Attacked Question: You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of `words` are of **the same length**.

A **concatenated substring** in `s` is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of `words` concatenated.

Original Question: A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

*   For example, for `arr = [1,2,3]`, the following are all the permutations of `arr`: `[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]`.

The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

*   For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.
*   Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.
*   While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers `nums`, _find the next permutation of_ `nums`.

The replacement must be **[in place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** and use only constant extra memory.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** \[1,3,2\]

CoT: ### Longest Valid Parentheses Substring

We can solve this problem using a stack data structure to keep track of the indices of the opening parentheses. When we encounter a closing parenthesis, we pop the top element from the stack if it's not empty. If the stack is empty, we push the current index into the stack. If the stack is not empty, we update the maximum length of the valid substring.

Original Question: There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return _the index of_ `target` _if it is in_ `nums`_, or_ `-1` _if it is not in_ `nums`.

*   `-104 <= target <= 104`
Attacked Question: Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,3,5,6\], target = 5
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,3,5,6\], target = 2
**Output:** 1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,3,5,6\], target = 7
**Output:** 4

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
*   `nums` contains **distinct** values sorted in **ascending** order.
*   `-104 <= target <= 104`
CoT: **Binary Search Solution**

We can solve this problem using a binary search algorithm, which has a runtime complexity of O(log n). Here's the Python code:

Original Question: Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1.  Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2.  Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3.  Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

Original Question: You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at `nums[0]`.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index `i`. In other words, if you are at `nums[i]`, you can jump to any `nums[i + j]` where:

*   `0 <= j <= nums[i]` and
*   `i + j < n`

*   It's guaranteed that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.
Attacked Question: You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at `nums[0]`.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index `i`. In other words, if you are at `nums[i]`, you can jump to any `nums[i + j]` where:

*   `0 <= j <= nums[i]` and
*   `i + j < n`

Return _the minimum number of jumps to reach_ `nums[n - 1]`. The test cases are generated such that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,1,1,4\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,0,1,4\]
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

Original Question: You are given a **large integer** represented as an integer array `digits`, where each `digits[i]` is the `ith` digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading `0`'s.

Increment the large integer by one and return _the resulting array of digits_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** digits = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** \[1,2,4\]
**Explanation:** The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be \[1,2,4\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** digits = \[4,3,2,1\]
**Output:** \[4,3,2,2\]
**Explanation:** The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be \[4,3,2,2\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** digits = \[9\]
**Output:** \[1,0\]
**Explanation:** The array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be \[1,0\].

Original Question: Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

*   A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
*   Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than `0` and not exceed `maxWidth`.
*   The input array `words` contains at least one word.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = \[ "This ",  "is ",  "an ",  "example ",  "of ",  "text ",  "justification. "\], maxWidth = 16
**Output:**
\[
    "This    is    an ",

**Output:**
\[
   "What   must   be ",

**Explanation:** Note that the last line is  "shall be     " instead of  "shall     be ", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = \[ "Science ", "is ", "what ", "we ", "understand ", "well ", "enough ", "to ", "explain ", "to ", "a ", "computer. ", "Art ", "is ", "everything ", "else ", "we ", "do "\], maxWidth = 20

Original Question: Given a string `path`, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.

In a Unix-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory, a double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `'//'`) are treated as a single slash `'/'`. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

The **canonical path** should have the following format:

*   The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.
*   Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.
*   The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.
*   The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

Return _the simplified **canonical path**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** path =  "/home/ "
**Output:**  "/home "
**Explanation:** Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** path =  "/../ "
**Output:**  "/ "
**Explanation:** Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** path =  "/home//foo/ "
**Output:**  "/home/foo "
**Explanation:** In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= path.length <= 3000`
*   `path` consists of English letters, digits, period `'.'`, slash `'/'` or `'_'`.

*   The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.
*   Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.
*   The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.
*   The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

Return _the simplified **canonical path**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** path =  "/home/ "
**Output:**  "/home "
**Explanation:** Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** path =  "/../ "
**Output:**  "/ "
**Explanation:** Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** path =  "/home//foo/ "
**Output:**  "/home/foo "
**Explanation:** In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= path.length <= 3000`
*   `path` consists of English letters, digits, period `'.'`, slash `'/'` or `'_'`.
*   `path` is a valid absolute Unix path.

Original Question: Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove some duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears **at most twice**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` _after placing the final result in the first_ `k` _slots of_ `nums`.

Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array
int\[\] expectedNums = \[...\]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums\[i\] == expectedNums\[i\];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,1,2,2,3\]
**Output:** 5, nums = \[1,1,2,2,3,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3\]
**Output:** 7, nums = \[0,0,1,1,2,3,3,\_,\_\]

CoT: ### Solution

We can solve this problem by using a two-pointer approach. The first pointer (`prev`) will keep track of the previous node in the list, and the second pointer (`curr`) will iterate through the list. If the current node's value is different from the previous node's value, we append the current node to the result list. If the current node's value is the same as the previous node's value, we skip the current node.

We can solve this problem using a stack-based approach. The idea is to keep track of the indices of the histogram bars and the heights of the bars. We will push the indices of the bars onto a stack and then pop the stack when we encounter a bar that is smaller than the bar at the top of the stack.

Original Question: We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:

1.  If the length of the string is 1, stop.
2.  If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
    *   Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is `s`, divide it to `x` and `y` where `s = x + y`.
    *   **Randomly** decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, `s` may become `s = x + y` or `s = y + x`.
    *   Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings `x` and `y`.

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of **the same length**, return `true` if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  "great ", s2 =  "rgeat "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
 "great " -->  "gr/eat " // divide at random index.
 "gr/eat " -->  "gr/eat " // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
 "gr/eat " -->  "g/r / e/at " // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
 "g/r / e/at " -->  "r/g / e/at " // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
 "r/g / e/at " -->  "r/g / e/ a/t " // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide  "at " to  "a/t ".
 "r/g / e/ a/t " -->  "r/g / e/ a/t " // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is  "rgeat " which is s2.
As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  "abcde ", s2 =  "caebd "
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  "a ", s2 =  "a "
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `s1.length == s2.length`
*   `1 <= s1.length <= 30`
*   `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters.

Original Question: You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array_ `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,2,3,0,0,0\], m = 3, nums2 = \[2,5,6\], n = 3
**Output:** \[1,2,2,3,5,6\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[1,2,3\] and \[2,5,6\].
The result of the merge is \[1,2,2,3,5,6\] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

**Input:** nums1 = \[1\], m = 1, nums2 = \[\], n = 0
**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[1\] and \[\].
The result of the merge is \[1\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[0\], m = 0, nums2 = \[1\], n = 1
**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[\] and \[1\].
The result of the merge is \[1\].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

**Constraints:**

*   `nums1.length == m + n`
*   `nums2.length == n`

Original Question: A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be **encoded** into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' ->  "1 "
'B' ->  "2 "
...
'Z' ->  "26 "

To **decode** an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `"11106 "` can be mapped into:

*   `"AAJF "` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`
*   `"KJF "` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`

Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `"06 "` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `"6 "` is different from `"06 "`.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return _the **number** of ways to **decode** it_.

CoT: ## Solution

The problem is a classic example of a combinatorics problem. We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.

We can use the fact that the number of unique BSTs with `n` nodes is equal to the `n`-th Catalan number.

Original Question: Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an **interleaving** of `s1` and `s2`.

An **interleaving** of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where `s` and `t` are divided into `n` and `m` substrings respectively, such that:

*   `s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
*   `t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
*   `|n - m| <= 1`
*   The **interleaving** is `s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ...` or `t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...`

**Note:** `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  "aabcc ", s2 =  "dbbca ", s3 =  "aadbbcbcac "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 =  "aa " +  "bc " +  "c ", and s2 into s2 =  "dbbc " +  "a ".
Interleaving the two splits, we get  "aa " +  "dbbc " +  "bc " +  "a " +  "c " =  "aadbbcbcac ".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  "aabcc ", s2 =  "dbbca ", s3 =  "aadbbbaccc "
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  " ", s2 =  " ", s3 =  " "
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= s3.length <= 200`
*   `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` consist of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it using only `O(s2.length)` additional memory space?

### Problem Description

Given the root of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake, recover the tree without changing its structure.

### Solution

We can solve this problem using a modified in-order traversal of the BST. The key idea is to detect the two nodes that were swapped by mistake. We can use two variables, `prev` and `first`, to keep track of the nodes that were swapped.

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Original Question: You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,1,5,3,6,4\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Attacked Question: You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,1,5,3,6,4\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,6,4,3,1\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`

Original Question: You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return _the **maximum** profit you can achieve_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,1,5,3,6,4\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = \[1,2,3,4,5\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** prices = \[7,6,4,3,1\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104`

*   Every `si` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
*   `sk == endWord`

*   Every `si` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
*   `sk == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return _the **number of words** in the **shortest transformation sequence** from_ `beginWord` _to_ `endWord`_, or_ `0` _if no such sequence exists._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** beginWord =  "hit ", endWord =  "cog ", wordList = \[ "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "lot ", "log ", "cog "\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** One shortest transformation sequence is  "hit " ->  "hot " ->  "dot " ->  "dog " -> cog ", which is 5 words long.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** beginWord =  "hit ", endWord =  "cog ", wordList = \[ "hot ", "dot ", "dog ", "lot ", "log "\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The endWord  "cog " is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= beginWord.length <= 10`
*   `endWord.length == beginWord.length`
*   `1 <= wordList.length <= 5000`
*   `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
*   `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
*   `beginWord != endWord`
*   All the words in `wordList` are **unique**.

Original Question: Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, _capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by_ `'X'`.

A region is **captured** by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

Original Question: Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List neighbors;
}

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\]\]
**Output:** \[\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\]\]
**Explanation:** There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\[\]\]
**Output:** \[\[\]\]
**Explanation:** Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   `Node.val` is unique for each node.
*   There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
*   The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

Original Question: There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `ith` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith` station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return _the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return_ `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**

**Example 1:**

**Input:** gas = \[1,2,3,4,5\], cost = \[3,4,5,1,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7

Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** gas = \[2,3,4\], cost = \[3,4,3\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == gas.length == cost.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104`

Original Question: A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` **brand new** nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. **None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list**.

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return _the head of the copied linked list_.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

*   `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
*   `random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

Your code will **only** be given the `head` of the original linked list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[\[7,null\],\[13,0\],\[11,4\],\[10,2\],\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[7,null\],\[13,0\],\[11,4\],\[10,2\],\[1,0\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[\[1,1\],\[2,1\]\]
**Output:** \[\[1,1\],\[2,1\]\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[\[3,null\],\[3,0\],\[3,null\]\]
**Output:** \[\[3,null\],\[3,0\],\[3,null\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= n <= 1000`
*   `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`
*   `Node.random` is `null` or is pointing to some node in the linked list.
Attacked Question: A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` **brand new** nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. **None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list**.

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return _the head of the copied linked list_.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

*   `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
*   `random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

Your code will **only** be given the `head` of the original linked list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[\[7,null\],\[13,0\],\[11,4\],\[10,2\],\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[7,null\],\[13,0\],\[11,4\],\[10,2\],\[1,0\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[\[1,1\],\[2,1\]\]
**Output:** \[\[1,1\],\[2,1\]\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[\[3,null\],\[3,0\],\[3,null\]\]
**Output:** \[\[3,null\],\[3,0\],\[3,null\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= n <= 1000`
*   `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`
*   `Node.random` is `null` or is pointing to some node in the linked list.
CoT: ### Solution

We can use a dictionary to store the mapping between the original nodes and their corresponding copied nodes. This way, we can efficiently get the copied node for a given original node.

Original Question: Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[3,2,0,-4\], pos = 1
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[1,2\], pos = 0
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[1\], pos = -1
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
*   `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

Original Question: Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a **[Least Recently Used (LRU) cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU)**.

Implement the `LRUCache` class:

*   `LRUCache(int capacity)` Initialize the LRU cache with **positive** size `capacity`.
*   `int get(int key)` Return the value of the `key` if the key exists, otherwise return `-1`.
*   `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the `key` if the `key` exists. Otherwise, add the `key-value` pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the `capacity` from this operation, **evict** the least recently used key.

The functions `get` and `put` must each run in `O(1)` average time complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "LRUCache ",  "put ",  "put ",  "get ",  "put ",  "get ",  "put ",  "get ",  "get ",  "get "\]
\[\[2\], \[1, 1\], \[2, 2\], \[1\], \[3, 3\], \[2\], \[4, 4\], \[1\], \[3\], \[4\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4\]

**Explanation**
LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}

lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4

*   `0 <= key <= 104`
*   `0 <= value <= 105`
*   At most `2 * 105` calls will be made to `get` and `put`.

Original Question: Given the `head` of a singly linked list, sort the list using **insertion sort**, and return _the sorted list's head_.

The steps of the **insertion sort** algorithm:

1.  Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list.
2.  At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list and inserts it there.
3.  It repeats until no input elements remain.

The following is a graphical example of the insertion sort algorithm. The partially sorted list (black) initially contains only the first element in the list. One element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list with each iteration.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[4,2,1,3\]
**Output:** \[1,2,3,4\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[-1,5,3,4,0\]
**Output:** \[-1,0,3,4,5\]

Original Question: You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents an arithmetic expression in a [Reverse Polish Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

Evaluate the expression. Return _an integer that represents the value of the expression_.

**Note** that:

*   The valid operators are `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.
*   Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
*   The division between two integers always **truncates toward zero**.
*   There will not be any division by zero.
*   The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
*   The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** tokens = \[ "2 ", "1 ", "+ ", "3 ", "\* "\]
**Output:** 9
**Explanation:** ((2 + 1) \* 3) = 9

**Example 2:**

**Input:** tokens = \[ "4 ", "13 ", "5 ", "/ ", "+ "\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6

**Example 3:**

**Input:** tokens = \[ "10 ", "6 ", "9 ", "3 ", "+ ", "-11 ", "\* ", "/ ", "\* ", "17 ", "+ ", "5 ", "+ "\]

= ((10 \* 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= tokens.length <= 104`
*   `tokens[i]` is either an operator: `"+ "`, `"- "`, `"* "`, or `"/ "`, or an integer in the range `[-200, 200]`.

Original Question: Given the `root` of a binary tree, turn the tree upside down and return _the new root_.

You can turn a binary tree upside down with the following steps:

1.  The original left child becomes the new root.
2.  The original root becomes the new right child.
3.  The original right child becomes the new left child.

The mentioned steps are done level by level. It is **guaranteed** that every right node has a sibling (a left node with the same parent) and has no children.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3,4,5\]
**Output:** \[4,5,2,null,null,3,1\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = \[1\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range `[0, 10]`.
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 10`
*   Every right node in the tree has a sibling (a left node that shares the same parent).
*   Every right node in the tree has no children.

Original Question: Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method to read `n` characters.

**Method read4:**

The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

File file( "abcde `"); // File is  "`abcde `", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  "abcd ", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  "e ", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  " ", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The `read` function will only be called once for each test case.
*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** file =  "abc ", n = 4
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abc ". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
Note that  "abc " is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** file =  "abcde ", n = 5
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abcde ". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** file =  "abcdABCD1234 ", n = 12
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  "abcdABCD1234 ". We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= file.length <= 500`
*   `file` consist of English letters and digits.
*   `1 <= n <= 1000`

*   `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
*   `listA` - The first linked list.
*   `listB` - The second linked list.
*   `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 8, listA = \[4,1,8,4,5\], listB = \[5,6,1,8,4,5\], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[4,1,8,4,5\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[5,6,1,8,4,5\]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 2, listA = \[1,9,1,2,4\], listB = \[3,2,4\], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
**Output:** Intersected at '2'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[1,9,1,2,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[3,2,4\]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = \[2,6,4\], listB = \[1,5\], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[2,6,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[1,5\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
*   The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
*   `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104`
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `0 <= skipA < m`
*   `0 <= skipB < n`
*   `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
*   `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that runs in `O(m + n)` time and use only `O(1)` memory?
Attacked Question: Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

*   `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
*   `listA` - The first linked list.
*   `listB` - The second linked list.
*   `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 8, listA = \[4,1,8,4,5\], listB = \[5,6,1,8,4,5\], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[4,1,8,4,5\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[5,6,1,8,4,5\]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 2, listA = \[1,9,1,2,4\], listB = \[3,2,4\], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
**Output:** Intersected at '2'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[1,9,1,2,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[3,2,4\]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = \[2,6,4\], listB = \[1,5\], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[2,6,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[1,5\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
*   The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
*   `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104`
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `0 <= skipA < m`
*   `0 <= skipB < n`
*   `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
*   `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that runs in `O(m + n)` time and use only `O(1)` memory?

We can solve this problem by first sorting the array and then finding the maximum difference between two successive elements. However, this approach would take O(n log n) time due to the sorting operation. To achieve a linear time complexity, we can use a bucket sort approach. Here's a Python solution that uses a bucket sort:

        return 0

    bucket_num = (max_val - min_val) // bucket_size + 1
    buckets = [[float('inf'), float('-inf')] for _ in range(bucket_num)]
    
    for num in nums:
        index = (num - min_val) // bucket_size
        buckets[index][0] = min(buckets[index][0], num)

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
Original Question: Given two version numbers, `version1` and `version2`, compare them.

Version numbers consist of **one or more revisions** joined by a dot `'.'`. Each revision consists of **digits** and may contain leading **zeros**. Every revision contains **at least one character**. Revisions are **0-indexed from left to right**, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example `2.5.33` and `0.1` are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in **left-to-right order**. Revisions are compared using their **integer value ignoring any leading zeros**. This means that revisions `1` and `001` are considered **equal**. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then **treat the revision as `0`**. For example, version `1.0` is less than version `1.1` because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are `0` and `1` respectively, and `0 < 1`.

_Return the following:_

*   If `version1 < version2`, return `-1`.
*   If `version1 > version2`, return `1`.
*   Otherwise, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** version1 =  "1.01 ", version2 =  "1.001 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** Ignoring leading zeroes, both  "01 " and  "001 " represent the same integer  "1 ".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** version1 =  "1.0 ", version2 =  "1.0.0 "
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** version1 does not specify revision 2, which means it is treated as  "0 ".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** version1 =  "0.1 ", version2 =  "1.1 "
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** version1's revision 0 is  "0 ", while version2's revision 0 is  "1 ". 0 < 1, so version1 < version2.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= version1.length, version2.length <= 500`
*   `version1` and `version2` only contain digits and `'.'`.
*   `version1` and `version2` **are valid version numbers**.
*   All the given revisions in `version1` and `version2` can be stored in a **32-bit integer**.

CoT: **Majority Element Problem Solution**

The majority element problem can be solved using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, which works by essentially maintaining a counter for the majority element. The idea is that as we iterate through the array, whenever we encounter the majority element, we increment the counter, and whenever we encounter a different element, we decrement the counter. Since the majority element appears more than `n/2` times, the counter will eventually reach 0 and then start incrementing again when we encounter the majority element. Therefore, at the end of the iteration, the last element in the counter will be the majority element.

Here's the Python code for the solution:

Original Question: Implement the `BSTIterator` class that represents an iterator over the **[in-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#In-order_(LNR))** of a binary search tree (BST):

*   `BSTIterator(TreeNode root)` Initializes an object of the `BSTIterator` class. The `root` of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.
*   `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns `false`.
*   `int next()` Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the pointer.

Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to `next()` will return the smallest element in the BST.

You may assume that `next()` calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next number in the in-order traversal when `next()` is called.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "BSTIterator ",  "next ",  "next ",  "hasNext ",  "next ",  "hasNext ",  "next ",  "hasNext ",  "next ",  "hasNext "\]
\[\[\[7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20\]\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, 3, 7, true, 9, true, 15, true, 20, false\]

**Explanation**
BSTIterator bSTIterator = new BSTIterator(\[7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20\]);

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 105]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 106`
*   At most `105` calls will be made to `hasNext`, and `next`.

Original Question: The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in **the bottom-right corner** of a `dungeon`. The `dungeon` consists of `m x n` rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in **the top-left room** and must fight his way through `dungeon` to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to `0` or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).

To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only **rightward** or **downward** in each step.

Return _the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess_.

**Note** that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** dungeon = \[\[-2,-3,3\],\[-5,-10,1\],\[10,30,-5\]\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** The initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path: RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.

### Problem Description

The problem is to find the minimum initial health required for a knight to rescue a princess from a dungeon. The dungeon is represented as a 2D grid where each room can contain threats or power-ups. The knight can move only rightward or downward in each step.

### Solution

We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. The idea is to maintain a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum initial health required to reach the room at `(i, j)`.

Original Question: You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions: i.e. you may buy at most `k` times and sell at most `k` times.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 2, prices = \[2,4,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.

**Input:** k = 2, prices = \[3,2,6,5,0,3\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= k <= 100`
*   `1 <= prices.length <= 1000`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`

**Note:**

*   Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
*   In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 2** above, the input represents the signed integer `-3` and the output represents the signed integer `-1073741825`.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to maintain two variables, `rob` and `not_rob`, which represent the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to the current house if the current house is robbed and not robbed, respectively.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:
Response: python

    if len(nums) == 1:
        return nums[0]

    # Initialize variables to store the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to the current house.
    rob = nums[0]
    not_rob = 0

    # Iterate over the houses.
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[
  \[ "1 ", "1 ", "1 ", "1 ", "0 "\],
  \[ "1 ", "1 ", "0 ", "1 ", "0 "\],
  \[ "1 ", "1 ", "0 ", "0 ", "0 "\],

CoT: **Minimal Length of Subarray**
================================

### Problem Statement

Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, return the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return `0` instead.

### Example Use Cases

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `target = 7`, `nums = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3]`
    *   Output: `2`
    *   Explanation: The subarray `[4, 3]` has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `target = 4`, `nums = [1, 4, 4]`
    *   Output: `1`
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `target = 11`, `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
    *   Output: `0`

### Constraints

*   `1 <= target <= 10^9`
*   `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

### Solution

We will use the two-pointer technique to solve this problem efficiently. The idea is to maintain a sliding window of elements in the array, and at each step, we try to minimize the window while ensuring its sum is greater than or equal to the target.

Original Question: Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding if a string matches any previously added string.

Implement the `WordDictionary` class:

*   `WordDictionary()` Initializes the object.
*   `void addWord(word)` Adds `word` to the data structure, it can be matched later.
*   `bool search(word)` Returns `true` if there is any string in the data structure that matches `word` or `false` otherwise. `word` may contain dots `'.'` where dots can be matched with any letter.

**Example:**

**Input**
\[ "WordDictionary ", "addWord ", "addWord ", "addWord ", "search ", "search ", "search ", "search "\]
\[\[\],\[ "bad "\],\[ "dad "\],\[ "mad "\],\[ "pad "\],\[ "bad "\],\[ ".ad "\],\[ "b.. "\]\]
**Output**
\[null,null,null,null,false,true,true,true\]

**Explanation**
WordDictionary wordDictionary = new WordDictionary();
wordDictionary.addWord( "bad ");
wordDictionary.addWord( "dad ");
wordDictionary.addWord( "mad ");
wordDictionary.search( "pad "); // return False
wordDictionary.search( "bad "); // return True
wordDictionary.search( ".ad "); // return True
wordDictionary.search( "b.. "); // return True

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= word.length <= 25`
*   `word` in `addWord` consists of lowercase English letters.
*   `word` in `search` consist of `'.'` or lowercase English letters.
*   There will be at most `2` dots in `word` for `search` queries.
*   At most `104` calls will be made to `addWord` and `search`.

Original Question: Find all valid combinations of `k` numbers that sum up to `n` such that the following conditions are true:

*   Only numbers `1` through `9` are used.
*   Each number is used **at most once**.

Return _a list of all possible valid combinations_. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 3, n = 7
**Output:** \[\[1,2,4\]\]
**Explanation:**
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
There are no other valid combinations.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** k = 3, n = 9

Original Question: A city's **skyline** is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return _the **skyline** formed by these buildings collectively_.

The geometric information of each building is given in the array `buildings` where `buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]`:

*   `lefti` is the x coordinate of the left edge of the `ith` building.
*   `righti` is the x coordinate of the right edge of the `ith` building.
*   `heighti` is the height of the `ith` building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`.

The **skyline** should be represented as a list of "key points " **sorted by their x-coordinate** in the form `[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

**Note:** There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** buildings = \[\[2,9,10\],\[3,7,15\],\[5,12,12\],\[15,20,10\],\[19,24,8\]\]
**Output:** \[\[2,10\],\[3,15\],\[7,12\],\[12,0\],\[15,10\],\[20,8\],\[24,0\]\]
**Explanation:**
Figure A shows the buildings of the input.
Figure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in figure B represent the key points in the output list.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** buildings = \[\[0,2,3\],\[2,5,3\]\]
**Output:** \[\[0,3\],\[5,0\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= buildings.length <= 104`

Original Question: Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (`push`, `top`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyStack` class:

*   `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
*   `int pop()` Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
*   `int top()` Returns the element on the top of the stack.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the stack is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

*   You must use **only** standard operations of a queue, which means that only `push to back`, `peek/pop from front`, `size` and `is empty` operations are valid.
*   Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "MyStack ",  "push ",  "push ",  "top ",  "pop ",  "empty "\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 2, 2, false\]

**Explanation**
MyStack myStack = new MyStack();
myStack.push(1);
myStack.push(2);
myStack.top(); // return 2
myStack.pop(); // return 2
myStack.empty(); // return False

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= x <= 9`
*   At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `empty`.
*   All the calls to `pop` and `top` are valid.

Attacked Question: You are given a **sorted unique** integer array `nums`.

A **range** `[a,b]` is the set of all integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive).

Return _the **smallest sorted** list of ranges that **cover all the numbers in the array exactly**_. That is, each element of `nums` is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer `x` such that `x` is in one of the ranges but not in `nums`.

Each range `[a,b]` in the list should be output as:

*   `"a->b "` if `a != b`
*   `"a "` if `a == b`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,2,4,5,7\]

Original Question: Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyQueue` class:

*   `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
*   `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
*   `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

*   You must use **only** standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
*   Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ "MyQueue ",  "push ",  "push ",  "peek ",  "pop ",  "empty "\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 1, 1, false\]

**Explanation**
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: \[1\]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: \[1, 2\] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is \[2\]
myQueue.empty(); // return false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= x <= 9`
*   At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`.
*   All the calls to `pop` and `peek` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the queue such that each operation is **[amortized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis)** `O(1)` time complexity? In other words, performing `n` operations will take overall `O(n)` time even if one of those operations may take longer.

Original Question: Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**)."

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5\], p = 2, q = 8
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5\], p = 2, q = 4
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = \[2,1\], p = 2, q = 1
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
*   `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
*   All `Node.val` are **unique**.
*   `p != q`

Original Question: There is a singly-linked list `head` and we want to delete a node `node` in it.

You are given the node to be deleted `node`. You will **not be given access** to the first node of `head`.

All the values of the linked list are **unique**, and it is guaranteed that the given node `node` is not the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

*   The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
*   The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
*   All the values before `node` should be in the same order.
*   All the values after `node` should be in the same order.

**Custom testing:**

*   For the input, you should provide the entire linked list `head` and the node to be given `node`. `node` should not be the last node of the list and should be an actual node in the list.
*   We will build the linked list and pass the node to your function.
*   The output will be the entire list after calling your function.

**Input:** head = \[4,5,1,9\], node = 5
**Output:** \[4,1,9\]
**Explanation:** You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])

    # Initialize the low and high pointers for the binary search
    low, high = 0, m * n - 1

    while low <= high:
        # Calculate the middle index
        mid = (low + high) // 2

        # Convert the middle index to a row and column index
        mid_val = matrix[mid // n][mid % n]

Original Question: Design an iterator to flatten a 2D vector. It should support the `next` and `hasNext` operations.

Implement the `Vector2D` class:

*   `Vector2D(int[][] vec)` initializes the object with the 2D vector `vec`.
*   `next()` returns the next element from the 2D vector and moves the pointer one step forward. You may assume that all the calls to `next` are valid.
*   `hasNext()` returns `true` if there are still some elements in the vector, and `false` otherwise.

**Follow up:** Could you implement a solution using only `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` runtime complexity?
Attacked Question: Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return _the only number in the range that is missing from the array._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,0,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range \[0,3\]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range \[0,2\]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1\]
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range \[0,9\]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 104`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
*   All the numbers of `nums` are **unique**.

Original Question: Design an algorithm to encode **a list of strings** to **a string**. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Machine 1 (sender) has the function:

string encode(vector strs) {
  // ... your code
  return encoded\_string;
}

Machine 2 (receiver) has the function:

vector decode(string s) {
  //... your code

So Machine 1 does:

string encoded\_string = encode(strs);

vector strs2 = decode(encoded\_string);

`strs2` in Machine 2 should be the same as `strs` in Machine 1.

Implement the `encode` and `decode` methods.

Original Question: Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper and `citations` is sorted in **ascending order**, return _the researcher's h-index_.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** citations = \[0,1,3,5,6\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** \[0,1,3,5,6\] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** citations = \[1,2,100\]
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

*   `n == citations.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

Original Question: Suppose you are at a party with `n` people labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other `n - 1` people know the celebrity, but the celebrity does not know any of them.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. You are only allowed to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B? " to get information about whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given a helper function `bool knows(a, b)` that tells you whether `a` knows `b`. Implement a function `int findCelebrity(n)`. There will be exactly one celebrity if they are at the party.

Return _the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity at the party_. If there is no celebrity, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[1,1,0\],\[0,1,0\],\[1,1,1\]\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph\[i\]\[j\] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph\[i\]\[j\] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[1,0,1\],\[1,1,0\],\[0,1,1\]\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There is no celebrity.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == graph.length == graph[i].length`
*   `2 <= n <= 100`
*   `graph[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
*   `graph[i][i] == 1`

**Follow up:** If the maximum number of allowed calls to the API `knows` is `3 * n`, could you find a solution without exceeding the maximum number of calls?

Original Question: Given two vectors of integers `v1` and `v2`, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

Implement the `ZigzagIterator` class:

*   `ZigzagIterator(List v1, List v2)` initializes the object with the two vectors `v1` and `v2`.
*   `boolean hasNext()` returns `true` if the iterator still has elements, and `false` otherwise.
*   `int next()` returns the current element of the iterator and moves the iterator to the next element.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1,2\], v2 = \[3,4,5,6\]
**Output:** \[1,3,2,4,5,6\]
**Explanation:** By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: \[1,3,2,4,5,6\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1\], v2 = \[\]

**Follow up:** What if you are given `k` vectors? How well can your code be extended to such cases?

**Clarification for the follow-up question:**

The "Zigzag " order is not clearly defined and is ambiguous for `k > 2` cases. If "Zigzag " does not look right to you, replace "Zigzag " with "Cyclic ".

**Follow-up Example:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1,2,3\], v2 = \[4,5,6,7\], v3 = \[8,9\]
**Output:** \[1,4,8,2,5,9,3,6,7\]
Attacked Question: Given two vectors of integers `v1` and `v2`, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

Implement the `ZigzagIterator` class:

*   `ZigzagIterator(List v1, List v2)` initializes the object with the two vectors `v1` and `v2`.
*   `boolean hasNext()` returns `true` if the iterator still has elements, and `false` otherwise.
*   `int next()` returns the current element of the iterator and moves the iterator to the next element.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1,2\], v2 = \[3,4,5,6\]
**Output:** \[1,3,2,4,5,6\]
**Explanation:** By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: \[1,3,2,4,5,6\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1\], v2 = \[\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** v1 = \[\], v2 = \[1\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= v1.length, v2.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= v1.length + v2.length <= 2000`
*   `-231 <= v1[i], v2[i] <= 231 - 1`

Original Question: Design an iterator that supports the `peek` operation on an existing iterator in addition to the `hasNext` and the `next` operations.

Implement the `PeekingIterator` class:

*   `PeekingIterator(Iterator nums)` Initializes the object with the given integer iterator `iterator`.
*   `int next()` Returns the next element in the array and moves the pointer to the next element.
*   `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there are still elements in the array.
*   `int peek()` Returns the next element in the array **without** moving the pointer.

**Note:** Each language may have a different implementation of the constructor and `Iterator`, but they all support the `int next()` and `boolean hasNext()` functions.

Original Question: Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return _this repeated number_.

You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and uses only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,3,4,2,2\]
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,1,3,4,2\]
**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `nums.length == n + 1`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
*   All the integers in `nums` appear only **once** except for **precisely one integer** which appears **two or more** times.

**Follow up:**

*   How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
*   Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?

CoT: **Solution**
===============

We can use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection) algorithm to solve this problem. The idea is to treat the array as a linked list where each index points to the value at that index. We then use two pointers, the "tortoise" and the "hare", to detect the cycle in the linked list.

Here's the Python code for the solution:
Response: python
def findDuplicate(nums):
    """
    Finds the duplicate number in the array.

    Args:
        nums (list): The array containing the duplicate number.

    Returns:
        int: The duplicate number.
    """
    # Phase 1: Detecting the cycle using tortoise and hare algorithm
    tortoise = nums[0]
    hare = nums[0]
    while True:
        tortoise = nums[tortoise]
        hare = nums[nums[hare]]
        if tortoise == hare:
            break

    # Phase 2: Finding the start of the cycle
    tortoise = nums[0]
    while tortoise!= hare:
        tortoise = nums[tortoise]
        hare = nums[hare]

    return hare

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]
print(findDuplicate(nums))  # Output: 2

nums = [3, 1, 3, 4, 2]

Original Question: The **abbreviation** of a word is a concatenation of its first letter, the number of characters between the first and last letter, and its last letter. If a word has only two characters, then it is an **abbreviation** of itself.

For example:

*   `dog --> d1g` because there is one letter between the first letter `'d'` and the last letter `'g'`.
*   `internationalization --> i18n` because there are 18 letters between the first letter `'i'` and the last letter `'n'`.
*   `it --> it` because any word with only two characters is an **abbreviation** of itself.

Implement the `ValidWordAbbr` class:

*   `ValidWordAbbr(String[] dictionary)` Initializes the object with a `dictionary` of words.
*   `boolean isUnique(string word)` Returns `true` if **either** of the following conditions are met (otherwise returns `false`):
    *   There is no word in `dictionary` whose **abbreviation** is equal to `word`'s **abbreviation**.
    *   For any word in `dictionary` whose **abbreviation** is equal to `word`'s **abbreviation**, that word and `word` are **the same**.

\[\[\[ "deer ",  "door ",  "cake ",  "card "\]\], \[ "dear "\], \[ "cart "\], \[ "cane "\], \[ "make "\], \[ "cake "\]\]
**Output**
\[null, false, true, false, true, true\]

**Explanation**
ValidWordAbbr validWordAbbr = new ValidWordAbbr(\[ "deer ",  "door ",  "cake ",  "card "\]);
validWordAbbr.isUnique( "dear "); // return false, dictionary word  "deer " and word  "dear " have the same abbreviation  "d2r " but are not the same.

validWordAbbr.isUnique( "make "); // return true, no words in the dictionary have the abbreviation  "m2e ".
validWordAbbr.isUnique( "cake "); // return true, because  "cake " is already in the dictionary and no other word in the dictionary has  "c2e " abbreviation.

Original Question: According to [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life): "The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. "

The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: **live** (represented by a `1`) or **dead** (represented by a `0`). Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, return _the next state_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[0,1,0\],\[0,0,1\],\[1,1,1\],\[0,0,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[0,0,0\],\[1,0,1\],\[0,1,1\],\[0,1,0\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\[1,1\],\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[1,1\],\[1,1\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 25`
*   `board[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

**Follow up:**

*   Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
*   In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

Original Question: You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend:

*   Initially, there is a heap of stones on the table.
*   You and your friend will alternate taking turns, and **you go first**.
*   On each turn, the person whose turn it is will remove 1 to 3 stones from the heap.
*   The one who removes the last stone is the winner.

Given `n`, the number of stones in the heap, return `true` _if you can win the game assuming both you and your friend play optimally, otherwise return_ `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** These are the possible outcomes:
1. You remove 1 stone. Your friend removes 3 stones, including the last stone. Your friend wins.
2. You remove 2 stones. Your friend removes 2 stones, including the last stone. Your friend wins.
3. You remove 3 stones. Your friend removes the last stone. Your friend wins.
In all outcomes, your friend wins.

Original Question: Given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where each `1` marks the home of one friend, return _the minimal **total travel distance**_.

The **total travel distance** is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.

The distance is calculated using [Manhattan Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), where `distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,0,0,0,1\],\[0,0,0,0,0\],\[0,0,1,0,0\]\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Given three friends living at (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2).
The point (0,2) is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 is minimal.
So return 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,1\]\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`

    # Calculate the total number of friends
    total_friends = len(friends)
    
    # Sort the x-coordinates of the friends
    x_coords = sorted([friend[0] for friend in friends])
    
    # Calculate the median x-coordinate
    median_x = x_coords[total_friends // 2]
    
    # Calculate the total travel distance
    total_distance = 0
    for friend in friends:
        total_distance += abs(friend[0] - median_x) + abs(friend[1] - np.median([friend[1] for friend in friends]))
    
    return total_distance

# Example 1:

A **consecutive sequence path** is a path where the values **increase by one** along the path.

Note that the path can start **at any node** in the tree, and you cannot go from a node to its parent in the path.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,null,3,2,4,null,null,null,5\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Longest consecutive sequence path is 3-4-5, so return 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[2,null,3,2,null,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Longest consecutive sequence path is 2-3, not 3-2-1, so return 2.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 104]`.
*   `-3 * 104 <= Node.val <= 3 * 104`

Original Question: You are playing the **[Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows)** game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

*   The number of "bulls ", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
*   The number of "cows ", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

Given the secret number `secret` and your friend's guess `guess`, return _the hint for your friend's guess_.

The hint should be formatted as `"xAyB "`, where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows. Note that both `secret` and `guess` may contain duplicate digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** secret =  "1807 ", guess =  "7810 "
**Output:**  "1A3B "
**Explanation:** Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
 "1807 "
  |
 "7810 "

**Example 2:**

**Input:** secret =  "1123 ", guess =  "0111 "
**Output:**  "1A1B "
**Explanation:** Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
 "1123 "         "1123 "
  |      or     |
 "0111 "         "0111 "
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000`
*   `secret.length == guess.length`
*   `secret` and `guess` consist of digits only.

Original Question: You are given an empty 2D binary grid `grid` of size `m x n`. The grid represents a map where `0`'s represent water and `1`'s represent land. Initially, all the cells of `grid` are water cells (i.e., all the cells are `0`'s).

We may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land. You are given an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [ri, ci]` is the position `(ri, ci)` at which we should operate the `ith` operation.

Return _an array of integers_ `answer` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the number of islands after turning the cell_ `(ri, ci)` _into a land_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 3, n = 3, positions = \[\[0,0\],\[0,1\],\[1,2\],\[2,1\]\]
**Output:** \[1,1,2,3\]
**Explanation:**
Initially, the 2d grid is filled with water.
- Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid\[0\]\[0\] into a land. We have 1 island.
- Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid\[0\]\[1\] into a land. We still have 1 island.
- Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid\[1\]\[2\] into a land. We have 2 islands.
- Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid\[2\]\[1\] into a land. We have 3 islands.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 1, n = 1, positions = \[\[0,0\]\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= m, n, positions.length <= 104`
*   `1 <= m * n <= 104`
*   `positions[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= ri < m`
*   `0 <= ci < n`

Original Question: An **additive number** is a string whose digits can form an **additive sequence**.

A valid **additive sequence** should contain **at least** three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Given a string containing only digits, return `true` if it is an **additive number** or `false` otherwise.

**Note:** Numbers in the additive sequence **cannot** have leading zeros, so sequence `1, 2, 03` or `1, 02, 3` is invalid.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  "112358 "
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8

**Example 2:**

1.  **Update** the value of an element in `nums`.
2.  Calculate the **sum** of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` **inclusive** where `left <= right`.

Implement the `NumArray` class:

Original Question: A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by _exactly_ one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`) are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs).

Return _a list of all **MHTs'** root labels_. You can return the answer in **any order**.

The **height** of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = \[\[1,0\],\[1,2\],\[1,3\]\]
**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 6, edges = \[\[3,0\],\[3,1\],\[3,2\],\[3,4\],\[5,4\]\]
**Output:** \[3,4\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
*   `edges.length == n - 1`
*   `0 <= ai, bi < n`
*   `ai != bi`
*   All the pairs `(ai, bi)` are distinct.
*   The given input is **guaranteed** to be a tree and there will be **no repeated** edges.

We will create a 3D DP table where `dp[i][j][k]` represents the maximum coins we can collect by bursting the balloons from index `i` to `j` (inclusive) and considering the balloons from index `i` to `k` (inclusive) as the last balloons to burst.

Here is the Python code for this problem:

CoT: Here's a Python solution using a stack. The idea is to maintain a stack and a set of characters that we have seen so far. We iterate over the string from left to right. If the current character is not in the set, we add it to the stack and the set. If it is in the set, we check if it is smaller than the top of the stack. If it is, we pop the top of the stack and add the current character to the stack. This way, we ensure that the stack always contains the smallest possible characters.
