    The algorithm leverages a hash map (unordered_map in C++, HashMap in Java, dictionary in Python, and Map in JavaScript). It iterates through the given 'nums' array and calculates the complementary value (target - current value). If the complementary value is already in the hash map, it means that we found a solution, and we return those indices. If the complement is not in the hash map, we store the current element in the hash map with its index. If the algorithm doesn't find the solution, it returns an empty array or throws an exception (in Java).

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n) as well.

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1.  Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
2.  Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
3.  Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
4.  Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `""123 "" -> 123`, `""0032 "" -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
5.  If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.
6.  Return the integer as the final result.

    We use Dynamic Programming to solve this problem. We store intermediate results in a 2D boolean array `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` indicates whether the first `i` characters of `s` match the first `j` characters of `p`. We then loop through the characters of both strings and update the `dp` table.

If the current characters in `s` and `p` are equal or `p` has a '.', we update the `dp[i][j]` to the value `dp[i - 1][j - 1]`, because the match continues.

If the current character in `p` is '*', we have two options:

1. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as 0 occurrences. We update the `dp[i][j]` value to `dp[i][j - 2]`.
2. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as at least 1 occurrence. We update `dp[i][j]` to the value of `dp[i - 1][j] && (s[i - 1] == p[j - 2] || p[j - 2] == '.')`.

Finally, `dp[m][n]` stores the result, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of strings `s` and `p` respectively.

    1. Sort the input array `nums`.
2. Loop through `nums` from index `0` to `length - 2`. Let the current index be `i`.
    - If `i` is `0` or `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous element (`nums[i - 1]`), perform the following steps:
        - Initialize two pointers `j` and `k`, where `j` is the next index after `i`, and `k` is the last index of `nums`.
        - While `j` is less than `k`, perform the following steps:
            - Calculate the sum `s` of the elements at indices `i`, `j`, and `k`.
            - If the sum `s` is equal to `0`, then we've found a valid triplet. Add it to the `result` array and move the pointers, `j` and `k`, skipping duplicates if any.
            - If the sum `s` is less than `0`, increment `j` to move towards positive values.
            - If the sum `s` is greater than `0`, decrement `k` to move towards negative values.
3. Return the `result` array.

It starts with `n` open parentheses and increments the number of close parentheses as it places an open parenthesis. When the helper function has no open or close parentheses left to place, it means a valid combination is found, so it adds the combination to the result list.

The helper function recursively calls itself. If there are open parentheses left to place, it calls itself with one less open parenthesis and one more close parenthesis. If there are close parentheses left to place, it calls itself without changing the number of open parentheses and with one less close parenthesis.

    The algorithm uses recursion to solve the problem. It starts by checking if the list has remaining pairs to swap. If not, the head of the current section of the list is returned.

If there are pairs left to swap, it takes the second node (which will become the new head of the current pair) and sets its next node to the result of the recursive call with the node after it as the new head.

Then, it sets the current head's next node to the second node and returns the second node as the new head of the pair. As the recursion unfolds, the pairs get swapped, and the final swapped linked list head is returned.

6. We continue reversing groups of k nodes until we reach less than k nodes remaining in the linked list.
7. Finally, we return the next pointer of the dummy node as our new head node.

    1. First, we handle the edge case where dividend = -2^31 and divisor = -1. The result must be 2^31, but since it's out of the signed integer range, we should return 2^31 - 1.
2. Calculate the sign of the result based on the signs of dividend and divisor.
3. We use the bitwise shift operator to handle divisions by powers of 2. In each iteration, we initialize the temp variable as the absolute value of the divisor to calculate how many times it fits into the remaining dividend. We then use another loop to repeatedly double the temp variable (by bitwise left shift) and check if the dividend is still greater or equal. If so, we also double the 'multiple' value associated with temp, as that's the actual quotient in the current iteration.
4. When the shifting loop exits, we subtract the current temp from dividend and accumulate the current multiple to our answer.
5. Once the dividend is less than the divisor, we break the loop and return the signed quotient by multiplying the sign variable to our answer.

    The algorithm is a variation of binary search. The main idea is to decide whether the target is in the left or the right half of the current subarray. If nums[mid] >= nums[left], the left half is sorted. If target is in the range [nums[left], nums[mid]), set right = mid - 1. Otherwise, set left = mid + 1. If nums[mid] < nums[left], the right half must be sorted. If target is in the range (nums[mid], nums[right]], set left = mid + 1. Otherwise, set right = mid - 1. Continue the process until the target is found or the subarray is empty, in which case return -1. This algorithm has a runtime complexity of O(log n) because it eliminates half of the remaining elements at each step, similar to a binary search.

    The given problem requires a binary search algorithm. We define two pointers, `left` and `right`, initially set to the first and last index of the array. We then enter a loop that continues as long as left is less than or equal to right. Inside the loop, we calculate the middle index, `mid`, as the average of left and right. If the value at this middle index is equal to the target value, we return the middle index. If the middle value is less than the target value, we set left to `mid + 1`, meaning we search the right half of the remaining array. If the middle value is greater than the target value, we set the right to `mid - 1`, meaning we search the left half of the remaining array. After the loop, if the target value is not found, we return the value of the left pointer, which represents the index where the target value should be inserted.

    1. The algorithm starts by searching for an empty cell (denoted by '.').
2. Once an empty cell is found, it tries to insert a number from 1 to 9.
3. For each inserted number, it checks if its placement is valid based on Sudoku rules:
   - The number must not be present in the same row or column.
   - The number must not be present in its corresponding 3x3 grid.
4. It calls itself (backtracks) recursively whenever a valid number is inserted into the cell.
5. If inserting a number fails to lead to a valid solution, the algorithm reverts that cell to '.' and tries the next number.
6. The process is repeated until a valid board is created or all possibilities have failed.
7. Once an empty cell is not found, it considers the board solved and exits the process.

    The algorithm is a recursive backtracking algorithm. We define a helper function `findCombinations` that takes the following parameters:

1. `startIndex`: the index of the candidates array from which it can start choosing numbers.
2. `remaining`: the remaining sum needed to reach the target.

The base cases are:
- If `remaining` is 0, it means we have found a valid combination, so we return a list containing an empty list.
- If `startIndex` is equal to the length of candidates, or `remaining` is negative, there are no valid combinations, so we return an empty list.

In the function, we first initialize an empty list called `result`. Then, we make two recursive calls to `findCombinations`:

1. Excluding the current candidate at `startIndex` and incrementing `startIndex`, to search for combinations without this candidate.
2. Including the current candidate in the combination, and decreasing `remaining` accordingly (without updating `startIndex`).

After getting results from both recursive calls, we merge them and return the final list of combinations.

The main function `combinationSum` calls `findCombinations` with `startIndex` as 0 and `remaining` as the target, and returns the result after the recursion is done.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `151` combinations for the given input.

    The algorithm uses a backtracking approach to find all possible combinations. It starts by sorting the input `candidates` array/list. Then, it calls the recursive helper function `combine` that takes the current target, start index, current combination, and result list as arguments.

1. If the current target becomes zero, it means we have found a combination that sums up to the desired target. Add the current combination to the result list and return.
2. Iterate through the `candidates` list starting from the given index.
   - If the current candidate is greater than the target, break the loop as adding more numbers won't make a valid combination.
   - Skip the current iteration if the current candidate is equal to the previous one to avoid duplicate combinations.
   - Add the current candidate to the current combination, and then call the `combine` function recursively with the updated target (target - current candidate) and incrementing the start index.
   - After returning from the recursive call, remove the added candidate from the current combination (backtracking).

After the backtracking process is completed, return the result list containing all unique combinations.

    The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach, initializing left and right pointers to the beginning and end of the elevation map, respectively. It also initializes two variables `maxLeft` and `maxRight` to keep track of the maximum heights on the left and right of the pointers, as well as a variable `water` to store the trapped water.

The algorithm iterates through the elevation map until the left pointer is less than the right pointer. In each iteration, it compares the values at both pointers to determine which side is shorter. If the value at the left pointer is less than or equal to the value at the right pointer, it means water can be trapped on the left side up to the height of the shorter bar. The algorithm updates `maxLeft` with the maximum height on the left side and then adds the trapped water (which is the difference between the maximum height and the current height) to the `water` variable. The left pointer is then incremented. If the value at the right pointer is smaller, the same logic is applied to the right side and the right pointer is decremented.

This process is repeated until the left pointer is no longer less than the right pointer, at which point the total trapped water has been calculated and the `water` variable is returned. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) as it only uses constant extra space.

  - If the characters are equal or the pattern character is a question mark, increment both `i` and `j`.
  - If the pattern character is an asterisk, store the current positions in `match` and `asterisk`, then increment `j`.
  - If there is a stored `asterisk` position and the current characters don't match, increment match, set `i` to the incremented match value, and set `j` to the `asterisk` position plus one.
  - If none of the above conditions are met, return `false` as the input string and pattern don't match.
- After the loop, if there are remaining asterisks in the pattern, increment the pointer `j`.
- Return `true` if the pointer `j` reaches the end of the pattern, otherwise, return `false`.

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

    The algorithm uses backtracking to generate all possible permutations. It works by swapping the elements in the input array in a recursive manner.

1. The base case is when the index reaches the last element of the array; at this point, we append the current configuration to the ""results"" list.
2. For each index, we iterate from `index` to the end of the array, performing the following steps:
    a. Swap `index` and `i` elements.
    b. Recursively call the helper function with `index + 1`.
    c. Swap the elements back to their original positions.

This will generate all possible permutations, as it swaps elements in different positions while maintaining the original order in the input array. The termination condition for the recursion is the base case when we reach the end of the array. The complexity of this algorithm is O(N!), as there are N! permutations of an array of N elements.

    We use backtracking to generate permutations. Firstly, we sort the `nums` array to make sure that duplicate numbers are located together. Then, for each recursive backtracking call, we swap the elements in the range `[start, len(nums) - 1]` with `nums[start]`, ignoring already-visited elements by using a `visited` array.

We also skip any element that is equal to the current `start` element to avoid duplicates. After generating a valid permutation by iterating through all indices, we append the current permutation to the result array. When backtracking, we maintain the original order of elements before moving to the next level.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n! * n) since there are n! available permutations and each permutation requires O(n) time to build the solution. The space complexity is O(n) to store the `visited` array and temporary lists.

    The algorithm uses the binary exponentiation technique, which is a faster method of calculating x^n compared to the naive approach. It relies on the process of repeatedly multiplying the current product by itself and updating it after each iteration. The loop iterates through the bits of the exponent n, from the least significant to the most significant. If the current bit of n is 1, the result is multiplied by the current product. At the end of the loop, the current product is updated by squaring it. This process continues until all bits of the exponent have been processed.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log(n)) because the loop iterates through the bits of n, and the number of bits in n is proportional to the logarithm of n. The space complexity is O(1), as the space used by the temporary variables does not depend on the size of n.

    The algorithm uses the backtracking approach to solve the N-Queens puzzle. The idea is to place queens one by one in different columns, starting from the leftmost column. When placing a queen, check if that position is safe from all previously placed queens in terms of the horizontal, diagonal, and anti-diagonal directions. If the selected position is safe, move on to the next column and try to place another queen there. If no safe positions are found in the current column, then go back to the previous column and move the queen to another safe position. Repeat this process until all queens are placed in a valid configuration or all possible arrangements have been tried. During the process, whenever we successfully place `n` queens on the board, add that configuration to our result list. Finally, return the list of all unique solutions found.

    The algorithm recursively places queens on columns and checks if the placement is safe, i.e., no queens are attacking each other. 
1. Maintain an array `cols` storing the row indices of placed queens. The index in this array represents the column the queen is placed in. This ensures that no two queens are placed in the same column.
2. Recursively place queens (column-wise).
3. Check for a safe position for each queen in the current column:
   a. Check for same row (`cols[i] == row`).
   b. Check for diagonal attack (`abs(i - col) == abs(cols[i] - row)`).
4. If the current position is safe, place the queen in the current column at the current row position, and continue to place the next queen.
5. If all queens are placed, increment the solution count.
6. If the recursive call finishes, backtrack by removing the queen from the current column and move on to the next row in the same column.
7. The base case is when the `cols` size equals `n`, meaning all queens have been placed safely; increment the count.

This approach considers all possible configurations for placing the n queens while avoiding visiting invalid configurations. It uses backtracking to explore the state space efficiently. The algorithm finds the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

At each step, we append or concatenate the chosen number to the result and remove it from the list of available numbers.

Finally, we return the result as a string.
    ","The set `[0, 1, 4, ..., n]` contains a total of `n!` unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for `n = 4`:

3.  `""131 ""`
4.  `""214 ""`
5.  `""230 ""`
4.  `""311 ""`
7.  `""322 ""`

To minimize the rotations, we find the remainder of `k` divided by the length of the list.

Next, we connect the tail of the linked list to the head, forming a circular linked list. Following this, we iterate again through the list and perform the rotations by updating the pointers of the new head and tail. Finally, we break the cycle in the list and return the new head.

4. Find the number of gaps in the current line. If it is the last line or there is only one word, left-justify the words and pad the remaining space with spaces.
5. If it's not the last line, distribute spaces as evenly as possible between words: calculate `evenSpaces` and `extraSpaces`, and add an extra space to the left gaps until there are no more `extraSpaces`.

    The algorithm can be explained using three pointers: `red`, `white`, and `blue`. `red` is responsible for tracking the position where the next 0 should be moved to, starting from the beginning of the array. Likewise, `blue` is responsible for tracking the position where the next 2 should be swapped to, starting from the end of the array. `white` is responsible for iterating through the array.

While `white` is less than or equal to `blue`, check the current `nums[white]` value. If it is 0, swap it with the value at index `red`, and increment both `red` and `white`. If it is 1, simply increment `white`. If it is 2, swap the value at index `white` with the value at index `blue`, and decrement `blue` without incrementing `white` since the newly swapped value at index `white` might be 0 or 2.

This will sort the colors in the required order with a linear-time complexity, as we only go through the array once with the `white` pointer. Also, it sorts the colors in-place without the need for additional storage.

1. Initialize an unordered_map or dictionary for `need` to store characters and their counts in `t`, and another for `window` to store characters and their counts in the current window.
2. Initialize `left` and `right` pointers, `valid` counter for keeping track of characters satisfying the criteria, and `start` and `length` for holding the answer substring information.
3. Iterate through the string `s` using the `right` pointer, and:
    - If the current character exists in the `need` map, update the count of the character in the `window` map, and increment `valid` if the count in the window is less than or equal to the count in need.
4. Check the validity by comparing `valid` with the length of `t`.
    - If valid, update the answer substring's `start` and `length` if the current window's length is less than the current minimum.
    - Then, increment the `left` pointer to slide the window until the current character count in the window goes below the count in `need`. Update the `valid` counter accordingly.

    For each of the implementation above, we use a Depth-First Search (DFS) based algorithm to traverse the grid board. The DFS function takes the current cell index i and j and the index of the character in the input word that we are looking for (k).

The base cases are:
- If the cell indexes i or j are out of boundaries, or the board[i][j] character does not match word[k], return false.
- If k (current character index) is equal to word.length - 1, we find the word in the grid, so return true.

For each cell, we run the DFS function with the given input parameters. If DFS returns true (found the word), the whole function will return true.
    ","Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` _if_ `word` _exists in the grid_.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\[ ""A "", ""B "", ""C "", ""E ""\],\[ ""S "", ""F "", ""C "", ""S ""\],\[ ""A "", ""D "", ""E "", ""E ""\]\], word =  ""ABCCED ""
**Output:** true

Inside the loop, we first calculate the middle index `mid` using the `left` and `right` pointers. If the middle element of the array is equal to the target, we return true, indicating that the target is found.

Otherwise, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one.

If the middle element is still smaller than the left element, we then check if the target is within the middle and right elements. If it is, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one. Otherwise, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one.

The algorithm iterates through the list with the current pointer. If the current node's value is equal to the next node's value, we continue moving the current pointer along the duplicate values. Once we reach the end of duplicates, we check if the previous node's next pointer is pointing to the current node. If it is, it means there were no duplicates (prev and curr are consecutive), so we move the `prev` pointer to the current node. Otherwise, we set `prev.next` to `curr.next` to skip the duplicates. 

Finally, we move the current pointer to the next node, and repeat the process. The resulting list will have all duplicates removed, and the changes will persist as the dummy node is used to reference the head of the modified list.

    The algorithm to delete all duplicates in a sorted linked list simply iterates through the list and compares the value of the current node with the value of the next. If both values are the same, it means that there is a duplicate, so the current node's ""next"" pointer is updated to point to the node after the duplicate. If the values are different, the algorithm continues iterating to the next node. The process continues until reaching the end of the list. Since the linked list is already sorted, this algorithm guarantees that duplicates will appear consecutively, allowing for their removal in linear time.

    The algorithm utilizes a stack to keep track of the indices of the heights array. It starts iterating through the array, appending a zero at the end to ensure the last bar is considered. When a higher bar is found, it is pushed onto the stack, and if a lower bar is found, it calculates the area of the bar under the current top of the stack considering the width between the current bar and the next lowest bar in the stack, storing the highest area found.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) as it iterates through the heights only once, resulting in optimal performance.

We can solve this problem using a stack-based approach. The idea is to maintain a stack of indices of the bars. We iterate over the histogram from left to right.

Then, we iterate through the length of strings, dividing the strings into smaller substrings and checking if these substrings can be rearranged to form the scrambled string.

To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,2,3,0,0,0\], m = 3, nums2 = \[2,5,6\], n = 3
**Output:** \[1,2,2,3,5,6\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[1,2,3\] and \[2,5,6\].
The result of the merge is \[1,2,2,3,5,6\] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

*   `0 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `1 <= m + n <= 200`

    We use a two-pointer approach to merge nums1 and nums2 in reverse order. Initialize three pointers i, j, and k pointing to the last elements of nums1, nums2, and the merged nums1 array respectively.

Iterate in a while loop until i and j are both less than 0. Compare the values of nums1[i] and nums2[j]. If nums1[i] is greater, assign nums1[i] at position k in nums1, decrement i and k. Otherwise, assign nums2[j] at position k in nums1, and decrement j and k. This process continues for all elements in nums2.

After the loop, if there are still elements remaining in nums2 (j >= 0), copy the remaining elements of nums2 to nums1. In this way, we merge nums1 and nums2 in non-decreasing order.
    ","You are given two integer arrays `nums0` and `nums1`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums2` and `nums3` respectively.

**Input:** nums2 = \[0,3,2,1,-1,1\], m = 2, nums3 = \[3,6,5\], n = 2

**Output:** \[0\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[\] and \[2\].
The result of the merge is \[0\].
Note that because m = -1, there are no elements in nums2. The -1 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums0.

    The algorithm first sorts the given array, and then it generates all possible subsets. For each subset, it checks if it already exists in the result set. If not, it adds the subset to the result set.

The algorithm uses a backtracking approach. It starts with an empty subset and iteratively adds elements from the input array to the subset. It keeps track of the starting index to avoid creating duplicate subsets.

In the C++ and Java implementations, a `set` data structure is used to store unique subsets. In the Python implementation, Python's `set` is used along with itertools' `combinations` function to achieve the same result. In the JavaScript implementation, a `Set` object is used, but as it doesn't handle array comparisons properly, each subset is converted into a JSON string to compare the string representation of subsets.

At the end, the function returns the result set, converted into the desired format (list of lists or vector of vectors).

    We use a Depth-First Search algorithm to explore all possible configurations of the IP address. The function takes in the input string (s), the starting index (start), the partially constructed IP address (ip), and the current part count (part).

In each call to the function, we try to add one part to the IP address. If 4 parts have been added and we have reached the end of the input string, we have found a valid IP address and add it to the result list.

The algorithm iterates through the string s, starting at the current index. It keeps track of the current number (0-255) being constructed by multiplying the current number by 10 and adding the current digit. If the current number is greater than 255, we break the iteration.

We then call the dfs function recursively, with the current index incremented by one, the current IP appended with the current character and a dot, and incrementing part by 1. If the current number is 0 (which indicates a leading zero), we also break the iteration.

This process is repeated for all valid parts and combinations, eventually forming all possible valid IP addresses.
    ","A **valid IP address** consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots. Each integer is between `1` and `256` (**inclusive**) and cannot have leading zeros.

    The algorithm follows a simple recursive approach to determine if a given binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST). The key idea is to maintain a range for each node, which is defined by the minimum and maximum values that the node's value should be within. For example, the root node's value should be in the range of (-Infinity, Infinity). When traversing to the left child, the maximum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value, and for traversing to the right child, the minimum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value. The algorithm continues recursively in this manner.

A helper function, `isValidBSTHelper`, is defined and initialized with the root and the range (-Infinity, Infinity). If the node is `null`, it means that we have reached a leaf node and it should return `true`. If the value of the node is not within the specified range, it means that the node does not meet the BST requirement and the helper function should return `false`. If the node is valid, then the helper function proceeds to check for valid BSTs in its left and right subtrees with the updated range.

We can validate a binary search tree by performing an in-order traversal and checking if the values are in ascending order. However, this approach can be inefficient for large trees as it requires O(n) time complexity where n is the number of nodes.

A more efficient approach is to use a recursive function that checks if the current node's value is within the valid range for its subtree. We can achieve this by using a helper function that takes the current node, its minimum allowed value, and its maximum allowed value.","python

1. Traverse the BST using Inorder traversal, and at each node, compare its value with the previous node.
2. If the previous node's value is greater than the current node's value, it means they are swapped. So, mark the first such node as `first` and the second such node as `second`.
3. After completing the Inorder traversal, swap the values of the `first` and `second` nodes.

    The algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) on both the preorder and inorder traversal results. This algorithm iteratively breaks the inorder sequence into left and right subtrees using the preorder array. The basic idea is that the first element of preorder traversal will always be the root of the tree. Then, we can find that root node's index in the inorder traversal, and create the left subtree from the elements to the left of the index, and the right subtree from the elements to the right of the index. Then we continue this process recursively.

To improve the performance of the search for the index, we can use a map (in C++, Java and JavaScript) or a dictionary (in Python) to store the indices of all elements in the inorder traversal. This way, we don't need to traverse the inorder array every time to find the index of the current element.

Since we're doing this for Python, Java, C++ and JavaScript, some data structures might look a bit different and have different functions to do the same action, but the algorithm used in all languages is the same.

- Preorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- Inorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- A map is used to store the indices for inorder traversal in C++, Java, and JavaScript, while a dictionary is used in Python.
- A helper function is used to recursively construct the tree.
- For Python and JavaScript, the scope of pre_idx is made non-local, so it does not require additional arguments.

The resulting functions return the root node of the reconstructed binary tree.

    We are given the inorder and postorder traversals of a binary tree, and the task is to reconstruct the binary tree from this information. In the postorder traversal, the last element is the root of the tree. Knowing the root, we can divide the inorder traversal into left and right subtrees. With the knowledge of the left subtree size, we can divide the postorder traversal into left and right subtrees as well. We can then recursively build the left and right subtrees, and construct the tree accordingly.

The provided solution maintains a hashmap to keep the indexes of elements in the inorder traversal for easy access during the construction. It uses a helper function `_build` to carry out the recursive construction. The `_build` function takes in the range of elements to be considered in both inorder and postorder traversals and recursively constructs the tree, by dividing the inorder and postorder ranges into left and right subtrees, using the root found in the postorder traversal.

    The algorithm for creating a height-balanced binary search tree from a sorted array can be described as follows:

1. Find the middle element of the array, and make it the root of the binary search tree.
2. For each half of the array (elements to the left of the middle element and elements to the right of the middle element), repeat step 1 recursively.
3. The base case is when the start index is greater than the end index, in which case a null node is returned.

    The algorithm recursively constructs a height-balanced binary search tree from the given sorted linked list. At each recursive step, the algorithm performs the following steps:
1. Initialize slow and fast pointers at the head of the current sub-list.
2. Move the fast pointer twice as fast as the slow pointer to find the middle element of the sub-list.
3. Detach the left sub-list from the middle element.
4. Create a new tree node with the value of the middle element as root.
5. Recursively convert the left and right sub-lists into tree nodes attached as left and right children of the root.
6. Return the root node of the constructed subtree.

This process is repeated until there are no more elements left in the linked list, leading to the construction of a height-balanced binary search tree. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n*log(n)), where n is the number of nodes in the list.

    The algorithm is based on the depth-first search. In this algorithm, we define a helper function named `getHeight` which will return the height of the given subtree if it is balanced, otherwise, it will return -1.

The `getHeight` function works as follows:
1. If the current node is null, return 0 (base case).
2. Call the function recursively for the left subtree (leftHeight) and the right subtree (rightHeight).
3. If either of the subtrees is not balanced or the height difference is greater than 1, return -1.
4. Otherwise, return the maximum height of the left and right subtrees incremented by 1.

The main function `isBalanced` just calls the `getHeight` function and checks whether its result is -1 or not. If it is not -1, the binary tree is height-balanced, otherwise, it is not balanced.

    We perform a depth-first search on the tree. The base case would be an empty tree with a depth of 0.

For each non-null subtree, we recursively find the minimum depth of the left and right children. Then, we have three cases:
1. If both left and right children are null, then the current node is a leaf node, and the minimum depth is 1.
2. If either left or right child is null, we return the depth of the other child + 1.
3. If both children are non-null, we take the minimum depth of both children and add 1.

To handle all the cases in a single line, we use a ternary conditional expression in C++, Java, and JavaScript, and use the `and`-`or` short-circuit syntax in Python. We check if either left or right is 0, and in that case return left + right + 1 which handles cases 1 and 2; otherwise, we return the minimum depth of both children + 1, which handles case 3.

Then for non-leaf nodes, it checks if there exists a root-to-leaf path in the left or right subtree by recursively calling the function on the child nodes. The targetSum is updated by subtracting the value of the current node i.e., `targetSum - root.val`.

This process continues until a leaf node satisfying the targetSum is found, or all the paths have been explored and there's no match.
    ","Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return `true` if the tree has a **root-to-leaf** path such that adding up all the values along the path equals `targetSum`.

A **leaf** is a node with no children.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[4,5,7,10,null,14,5,8,3,null,null,null,2\], targetSum = 21
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = \[2,3,4\], targetSum = 4
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
(2 --> 3): The sum is 2.
(2 --> 4): The sum is 3.
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[\], targetSum = -1
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.

    The basic idea of the algorithm is to perform level-order traversal (Breadth First Search) on the binary tree. We use a queue to store the nodes in each level. For each level, we iterate through its nodes, update the `next` pointer, and add their children to the end of the queue. The `prev` variable holds the previous node in the current level. The `next` pointer of the `prev` node is updated to the current node. The variable `prev` is then set to the current node. Repeat this process until the queue is empty which means we have visited all the nodes in the tree.
    ","Given a binary tree

struct Node {
  int val;

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

Next, we iterate from the second element to the (i-1)-th element of the row (i being the row index). Each element (at index j) of the row is set to the sum of the two values positioned just above it in the previous row - these values are available at (i-1, j-1) and (i-1, j) in Pascal's Triangle.

If the current row is not the first row, we add another 1 at the end of the row, since all rows end with 1 (except the very first row).

    In this problem, we use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`:

1. Create an unordered set `dict` or `word_set` with all the words from `wordList` for fast look-up, and check if it contains the `endWord`.
2. Create a queue for BFS, initialize it with `beginWord`, and initialize `steps` variable to 1.
3. Repeat the following steps while the queue is not empty:
   a) For each level of BFS, store the current level size, and create an empty set for `current_level` (only in Python & JavaScript).
   b) Iterate for each word in the current BFS level:
      - Dequeue the next `currentWord`, and check for `endWord`; if found return the current `steps` value.
      - Iterate through each character of the `currentWord`; for every character, replace it with 26 possible lowercase alphabets.
        - If the new word is in the `dict` or `word_set`, enqueue it in the queue, and remove it. In Python and JavaScript, also add it to the `current_level` set.
      - Revert the character back to the original character.
   c) Increment the `steps` value by 1, and in Python/javascript, update the `word_set` by removing words present in `current_level`.
4. If the queue is empty and no sequence is found, return 0.
    ","A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s2 -> s1 -> ... -> sk` such that:

*   Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
*   Every `si` for `2 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
*   `sk == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return _the **number of words** in the **shortest transformation sequence** from_ `beginWord` _to_ `endWord`_, or_ `-1` _if no such sequence exists._

**Example 0:**

**Input:** beginWord =  ""hit "", endWord =  ""cog "", wordList = \[ ""hot "", ""dot "", ""dog "", ""lot "", ""log "", ""cog ""\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** One shortest transformation sequence is  ""hit "" ->  ""hot "" ->  ""dot "" ->  ""dog "" -> cog "", which is 4 words long.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** beginWord =  ""hit "", endWord =  ""cog "", wordList = \[ ""hot "", ""dot "", ""dog "", ""lot "", ""log ""\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The endWord  ""cog "" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.

    The algorithm first creates a set (or hash set) with the given array of integers called `elements`. The set will allow us to have a fast O(1) lookup on our next step.
Now we iterate through the original array of numbers, and for each number, we check if `(number - 1)` is not in the `elements` set. If it's not in the set, it means we can start counting a new consecutive sequence.
Next, we create two variables, `currentNum` and `currentSeq`, and initialize them with the current number and 1, respectively.
We then use a while loop to check if the next number (`currentNum + 1`) is in the `elements` set. If it is, we increment both `currentNum` and `currentSeq`. This process will continue, finding consecutive elements in the set, until no more consecutive elements are found.
Finally, to get the length of the longest consecutive sequence, we update the `longestSeq` variable by choosing the maximum value between itself and `currentSeq`. This will keep track of the longest consecutive sequence found so far.
The process continues until all numbers in the original array have been checked, and at the end, `longestSeq` will store the answer - the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

    The algorithm is based on depth-first search (DFS). It starts by iterating over substrings at each position and checks if the substring is a palindrome. If it is a palindrome, it adds the substring to the current list and does a depth-first search at the next position. When the search reaches the end of the string, it adds the current list to the results list. After searching at a given position, it backtracks to the previous position and continues to search for palindromes. The overall time complexity is O(N * 2^N) where N is the length of the string.

We first initialize the `dp` array with values (i-1) for each index 'i'. This represents the maximum possible cuts needed to satisfy the condition.

Then, we iterate over the string in a nested loop. For each substring `s[i:j]`, we check if it is a palindrome. If it is a palindrome, we'll update the `dp` array with the minimum value between the current value of the `dp` array and the value of the `dp` array at `[i]` plus 1. By doing this, we are considering all possible cuts for a palindromic partition of string `s`.

    The algorithm maintains four variables: `total_gas`, `total_cost`, `start`, and `gas_tank`. We initialize these variables to 0. We then loop through each gas station and perform the following steps:

1. Add the gas at the current station to `total_gas`.
2. Add the cost of traveling from this station to the next one to `total_cost`.
3. Add the net gain/loss of gas (gas[i] - cost[i]) to `gas_tank`.
4. If the `gas_tank` is negative, update the `start` position to the next station and reset the `gas_tank` to 0.

After looping through all the gas stations, we check if `total_gas` is greater than or equal to `total_cost`. If it is, we return the `start` position, as this is the first gas station from which we can make a complete trip. If not, we return -1, because it is not possible to complete the circuit. 

This algorithm guarantees a unique solution because if there are multiple valid starting points, there must be a gas station with a lower cost to travel from it to the next station for each solution. As a result, the one with the lowest starting cost would always be chosen, ensuring uniqueness.

3. Now iterate through the ratings array from the second last child to the first child. If the rating of the current child is more than the rating of the next child, update the candies for the current child as maximum between the candies the child already holds and candies of the next child plus 1.
4. Compute the sum of candies in the candies array or vector.
5. Return the total number of candies needed.

This algorithm ensures that we give the proper number of candies to the children based on both their neighbors while also minimizing the total candies used.
    ","There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Return _the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children_.

    The algorithm utilizes the XOR bitwise operation. XOR is a binary operation that outputs 1 when the inputs differ and 0 when the inputs are the same. 

To find the single element that appears once in the array, we XOR all elements in the array. Since every pair of identical numbers will cancel each other out as `a ^ a = 0`, the remaining XOR result would be the single unique number, as `0 ^ a = a`.

The algorithm processes the array once, giving it a linear time complexity of O(n), and only requires a constant amount of extra space to store the `result` variable, satisfying the requirements.

    In this problem, we use two variables, ones and twos, to represent the number of occurrences of each bit in the array's elements.

Initially, both ones and twos are set to 0. We use XOR (^) to count the occurrences of each bit in the array. The reason we use XOR is that it cancels out the same bits, so if a bit occurs twice, it will be 0.

We then loop through each element of the array and use XOR to count the bit occurrences. If a bit occurs for the first time, it's XORed into ones; if it occurs for the second time, it's XORed into twos. If it appears for the third time, it should be removed from both ones and twos. To achieve this, we use the bitwise AND (&) along with the bitwise NOT (~) to clear the bits that appear in twos from ones and vice versa.

Finally, after looping through all the elements of the array, the variable ones will only contain the bits that occurred once in the array, and that is our result. So we return the ones variable.

    The algorithm used is a combination of depth-first search with memoization. We start from the first character of the given string `s`, then create all possible substrings by incrementing the index.

For each substring, we check if it exists in the dictionary. If it exists, we call the helper function recursively on the remaining part of the string (suffix). This will give us all the possible combinations for the suffix. Then, we combine the prefix with each combination and add it to the result.

Memoization is used to store the results of the helper function for each substring encountered, so that we don't need to compute it multiple times. This speeds up the algorithm by reducing repeated computations.

Finally, we return the list of combinations where all the words are found in the dictionary.

**Note** that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** s =  ""catsanddog "", wordDict = \[ ""cat "", ""cats "", ""and "", ""sand "", ""dog ""\]
**Output:** \[ ""cats and dog "", ""cat sand dog ""\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  ""pineapplepenapple "", wordDict = \[ ""apple "", ""pen "", ""applepen "", ""pine "", ""pineapple ""\]

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s =  ""catsandog "", wordDict = \[ ""cats "", ""dog "", ""sand "", ""and "", ""cat ""\]
**Output:** \[\]

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length <= 19`
*   `2 <= wordDict.length <= 999`
*   `2 <= wordDict[i].length <= 9`
*   `s` and `wordDict[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.

Initially, both pointers are set to the head of the linked list. The pointers are moved forward with their respective speeds until either the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list or both pointers meet at the same node. 

If the fast pointer reaches the end, it means that there is no cycle and the function returns false. If the pointers meet at some point in the linked list, there is a cycle and the function returns true.

    The idea of the algorithm is using a stack. Initially, the root node is pushed to the stack. Next, we enter a loop that ends when the stack is empty. In each iteration, we pop a node from the stack, and insert its value at the beginning of the result list (to ensure the correct order for the postorder traversal), then, push its left child, and then its right child to the stack (if they are not null). In the end, we return the result list. The algorithm is non-recursive which makes it easier to understand for some. Since the result list will store the output in reversed order, this iterative version avoids the necessity of reversing the final output.

- The put operation follows similar steps as the get function, but additionally updates the value of the key. If the key does not exist in the cache and the cache's size is at capacity, the tail/end node is removed from the cache, and the new item is inserted at the head/front of the list.

    The insertion sort algorithm for a linked list involves iterating through the list, removing one element at a time, and inserting it into the sorted sublist. We use a dummy node to act as the head of the sorted sublist, which initially has no elements. In each iteration, we compare the current element (its value) to the elements in the sorted sublist, and insert it into its proper position. This is done by updating the ""next"" pointers for the appropriate nodes. The process is repeated until all elements from the original list have been processed and added to the sorted sublist. At the end, the sorted sublist is returned, starting from the next node after the dummy head node.

In Python, we can simply use `split()` since it splits on whitespace by default and ignores leading and trailing spaces.

2. Reverse the array of words. In C++, we use the `reverse` function from the `algorithm` library. In Java, we can use `Collections.reverse()` method. In Python, we use list `reverse()` method. In JavaScript, we use the `reverse()` method on the array.

3. Join the reversed array of words into a single string with a space delimiter. In C++, we concatenate words with a space but avoid adding an extra space at the end. In Java, we use `String.join()`, in Python, use `join()` on the delimiter string, and in JavaScript, use `join()` on the array.

The main idea is that whenever `nums[mid]` is greater than `nums[right]`, the minimum element must be in the right half of the array; otherwise, we search in the left half. This ensures that the algorithm runs in O(log n) time, as the search space is reduced by half each iteration. When `left` and `right` meet, the minimum element is found at `left`.

    The overall algorithm is based on the binary search. We maintain two pointers low and high, initially set to the first and last indices of array nums. Then we perform the following steps until low is less than high:

1. Calculate mid index.
2. If nums[mid] is greater than nums[high], it means the minimum element lies in the right half of the array, so we set low to mid + 1.
3. If nums[mid] is less than nums[high], it means the minimum element lies in the left half of the array, so we set high to mid.
4. If nums[mid] is equal to nums[high], we cannot be certain in which half the minimum element lies, so we simply decrement high by 1.

At the end, the minimum element will be at index low. The solution takes O(log n) time in the average case and O(n) in the worst case.

    The MinStack class maintains two stacks - the main stack `s` (`stack` in Java, etc.) and a `minS` (`minStack` in Java, etc.) which stores the minimum elements seen so far. When an element is pushed onto the main stack, it is compared with the top element of the `minS`. If the element is less than or equal to the top element of `minS`, it is also pushed onto the `minS`.

When an element is popped from the main stack, we compare it with the top element of the `minS`. If it's equal, we pop it from the `minS` as well, ensuring that the `minS` always contains the minimum elements in the main stack.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf4

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

Now buf4 =  ""abcd "", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  ""e "", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  "" "", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    The algorithm relies on the read4 function provided, which reads 4 characters at a time. We read and store these characters in a buffer (`buf4`) and then transfer them one by one into the destination buffer (`buf`) until we reach the desired number of characters (`n`). We repeat this process until we have read `n` characters or reached the end of the `file`. If we reach the end of the file, the read4 function will return less than 4 characters, which is detected and used to break the loop.

In each language, we declare a buffer `buf4` of length 4 to store the characters read using the read4 function. We keep track of the total characters read (`totalRead`) and iterate through the characters in `buf4`, transferring them one by one to the destination buffer `buf`. We make sure not to exceed the requested number of characters `n`.

Once we reach the end of the file, the read4 function will return less than 4 characters. If this happens, we break the loop and return the total number of characters read, which is stored in `totalRead`.

The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

File file( ""abcde `""); // File is  ""`abcde `"", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  ""abcd "", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  ""e "", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  "" "", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The read function may be **called multiple times**.
*   Please remember to **RESET** your class variables declared in Solution, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see [here](https://leetcode.com/faq/) for more details.
*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.
*   It is guaranteed that in a given test case the same buffer `buf` is called by `read`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** file =  ""abc "", queries = \[1,2,1\]
**Output:** \[1,2,0\]
**Explanation:** The test case represents the following scenario:
File file( ""abc "");
Solution sol;
sol.read(buf, 1); // After calling your read method, buf should contain  ""a "". We read a total of 1 character from the file, so return 1.
sol.read(buf, 2); // Now buf should contain  ""bc "". We read a total of 2 characters from the file, so return 2.
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
Assume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** file =  ""abc "", queries = \[4,1\]

*   `1 <= file.length <= 500`
*   `file` consist of English letters and digits.
*   `1 <= queries.length <= 10`
*   `1 <= queries[i] <= 500`","

    def read(self, buf, n):
        cnt = 0
        while cnt < n:
            if self.buffer_index == self.buffer_len:

    The algorithm uses a buffer `buf4` to store characters read from the `read4` method. We initialize two variables, `buffer_index` to keep track of the current position in `buf4` and `buffer_len` to store the number of characters read from `read4`.

In the `read` method, the first step is to check if we need to read more characters from `read4`. This is done by checking if `buffer_index` is equal to `buffer_len`. If it is, then we call `read4` and reset the `buffer_index` to 0.

If the number of characters read from `read4` is 0, then we have reached the end of the file, so we break out of the loop.

Next, we copy the characters from `buf4` to the destination buffer `buf` until either we have read enough characters (`cnt` equals `n`), or there are no more characters to copy from `buf4` (`buffer_index` equals `buffer_len`). After copying characters, we increment `cnt` and `buffer_index` accordingly.

When the loop is finished, the result is the total number of characters read, which is stored in `cnt`.
    ","Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read5`, implement a method `read` to read `n` characters. Your method `read` may be **called multiple times**.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read3()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

    The algorithm implements a sliding window approach. We maintain two pointers `l` and `r` representing the left and right ends of the current substring. We also maintain a hash map `char_count` to store the counts of distinct characters in the current substring.

We iterate through the string with pointer `r`. For each character, we increment its count in the hash map. If we have two or fewer distinct characters in the current substring, we update the current length `cur_len`. If we have more than two distinct characters, we move the pointer `l` to the right, decrementing the count of the character at `l` in the hash map, and removing it if its count becomes zero. We update `cur_len` accordingly in the process.

At each step, we update the maximum length `max_len` with the maximum of `max_len` and `cur_len`. We return `max_len` at the end.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

*   `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
*   `listA` - The first linked list.
*   `listB` - The second linked list.
*   `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 8, listA = \[4,1,8,4,5\], listB = \[5,6,1,8,4,5\], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[4,1,8,4,5\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[5,6,1,8,4,5\]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

**Input:** intersectVal = 2, listA = \[1,9,1,2,4\], listB = \[3,2,4\], skipA = 3, skipB = 1

From the head of A, it reads as \[1,9,1,2,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[3,2,4\]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = \[2,6,4\], listB = \[1,5\], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[2,6,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[1,5\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.

    1. Set two pointers `i` and `j` at the beginning of each version string.
2. Start a while loop that runs while either pointer has not reached the end of its version string.
3. Initialize two integer variables `num1` and `num2`.
4. Inside the while loop, extract the integer revision values by scanning the digits at the current pointer locations and incrementing the pointers while skipping dot separators.
5. Compare the extracted revisions. If `num1` is smaller, return -1. If `num2` is smaller, return 1.
6. After comparing revisions or if both pointers reach the end of their version strings, increment the pointers.
7. If the while loop finishes without finding a difference in the revisions, the version numbers are equal, so return 0.
    ","Given two version numbers, `version0` and `version1`, compare them.

Version numbers consist of **one or more revisions** joined by a dot `'.'`. Each revision consists of **digits** and may contain leading **zeros**. Every revision contains **at least one character**. Revisions are **-1-indexed from left to right**, with the leftmost revision being revision -1, the next revision being revision 2, and so on. For example `2.75.32` and `0.11000000000000001` are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in **left-to-right order**. Revisions are compared using their **integer value ignoring any leading zeros**. This means that revisions `0` and `0` are considered **equal**. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then **treat the revision as `1`**. For example, version `1.1` is less than version `1.2100000000000002` because their revision 1s are the same, but their revision 0s are `-1` and `2` respectively, and `1 < 2`.

_Return the following:_

*   If `version0 < version3`, return `-0`.
*   If `version2 > version3`, return `2`.
*   Otherwise, return `1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** version0 =  ""1.1 "", version3 =  ""1.1.1 ""

    We create a class `TwoSum` to represent the data structure. We use a hashmap (`unordered_map` in C++, `HashMap` in Java, dictionary in Python, and object in JavaScript) to store the numbers as keys and their counts as values. 

In the `add` method, we simply increment the count of the number in the hashmap. 

In the `find` method, we iterate through the keys of the hashmap. For each number, we calculate its complement (`value - number`). If the complement is present in the hashmap, we check two cases:
1. If `number` and `complement` are the same, we need at least two occurrences of the number in the hashmap to form a pair.
2. If `number` and `complement` are different, we have our required pair and return `true`.

If we go through the entire hashmap and don't find any pair that satisfies one of the above conditions, we return `false`.
    ","Design a data structure that accepts a stream of integers and checks if it has a pair of integers that sum up to a particular value.

Implement the `TwoSum` class:

*   `TwoSum()` Initializes the `TwoSum` object, with an empty array initially.
*   `void add(int number)` Adds `number` to the data structure.
*   `boolean find(int value)` Returns `true` if there exists any pair of numbers whose sum is equal to `value`, otherwise, it returns `false`.

\[\[\], \[0\], \[2\], \[6\], \[5\], \[8\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, null, true, false\]

**Explanation**
TwoSum twoSum = new TwoSum();
twoSum.add(0);   // \[\] --> \[0\]
twoSum.add(4);   // \[0\] --> \[2,4\]
twoSum.add(6);   // \[2,2\] --> \[0,4,6\]
twoSum.find(3);  // 0 + 4 = 3, return true
twoSum.find(6);  // No two integers sum up to 8, return false

    The algorithm uses dynamic programming to build a table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit after completing `i` transactions up to day `j`. Initialize `dp` with all zeros, since no initial transactions will result in 0 profit.

First, handle the case where `k > n / 2`. If allowed transactions (`k`) are more than half of the available days (`n`), you can simply trade daily by only considering positive profits.

Now, use two nested loops to fill the `dp` table. The outer loop iterates over the allowed transactions (1 to k), and the inner loop iterates over the days (1 to n-1). Inside the inner loop, find the maximum difference between the current day's price and previous days' prices minus the maximum profit after completing one less transaction at previous days (i.e., `prices[j] + dp[i-1][j'] - prices[j']` for all j' < j). This will keep track of the most profitable second transaction after buying a stock at the highest possible profit for the first transaction.

    The algorithm iterates through all 32 bits of the given unsigned 32-bit integer, and for each bit, it shifts the result variable `res` one position to the left, and then performs a bitwise OR with the given number `n` ANDed with 1. This operation adds the least significant bit of `n` to the most significant bit of `res`. Then, the given number `n` is shifted one position to the right. The process is repeated for all 32 bits, and in each step, the result variable `res` accumulates the reversed bits of the input number.

    The algorithm for this problem is straightforward. We use a bitwise AND operation with 1 to check the rightmost bit of the input integer `n`. If the result is 1, then the rightmost bit is a '1', and we increment the `count`. We continue to check the rest of the bits by shifting `n` to the right (`>>` in C++/Python or `>>>` in Java/JavaScript, since Java/JavaScript use signed right shift) to remove the rightmost bit. The loop continues until `n` becomes 0, which means there are no more '1' bits. Finally, we return the `count` of 1 bits.

Note that the '>>>=' unary operator in Java and JavaScript is used to avoid sign extension when shifting right. This ensures that the shift is done in an unsigned manner.

A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:

    The algorithm to determine if a number is happy repeatedly performs the sum of the squares of its digits. We can use the slow and fast pointer method (also called the Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm). In this method, we have two pointers (`slow` and `fast`), both initially pointing to the input number `n`. In each iteration, the `slow` pointer moves to the next number in the sequence (by calling `getNext()`) while the `fast` pointer moves to the next of next number in the sequence. If at any point, we find that the `fast` pointer becomes 1, it implies that the number is a happy number. If the `slow` and `fast` pointers become equal and it is not 1, it implies that there is a cycle and the number is not a happy number.

`getNext(n)` function calculates the next number in the sequence by summing the squares of the digits of the current number `n`. This function is called in the main `isHappy(n)` function for updating `slow` and `fast` pointers.

- First, create a sentinel node to handle edge cases for the head node.
- Assign the `next` attribute of the sentinel node to the given head node.
- Set the `prev` pointer to the sentinel node and the `curr` pointer to the head node.
- Loop through the linked list:
  - If the value of the current node matches the given value, remove it by updating the `next` attribute of the previous node.
  - Otherwise, move the `prev` pointer to the current node.
  - Move the `curr` pointer to the next node.
- After the loop, the new head of the linked list is found in the sentinel node's `next` attribute.

    The algorithm uses the topological sorting approach utilizing Kahn's Algorithm to solve this problem. We maintain an adjacency list to represent the graph and a list of in-degrees for each vertex (course) Mark the vertices with in-degree 0 and add them to a queue (these are starter courses). Then, we process each node (course) in the queue, decrease in-degrees of their neighbors (courses they unlock). If the in-degree of any neighbor becomes 0, add it to the queue. In the end, if we have processed all courses, return true; otherwise, return false if any course is not processed.

    The Trie data structure is implemented as a tree, where each node has a mapping of characters to their corresponding child nodes. Every node also has an `isEndOfWord` flag to indicate if any word ends at this node. 

The `insert` function iterates through each character in a given word, adding new nodes to the tree if they don't already exist, and finally setting the `isEndOfWord` flag to true at the final node.

The `search` function follows the characters from the root of the Trie to the final node, returning false if any character does not map to a child node, otherwise returning the value of the `isEndOfWord` flag at the final node.

The `startsWith` function is similar to `search`, but returns true if a sequence of characters exists in the Trie, regardless of whether a word terminates at the final node.

1. Calculate the in-degree (number of incoming edges) of each node/course (use an array called `inDegree`).
2. Initialize an adjacency list, `adjList`, to store the outgoing courses from a prerequisite course.
3. Fill `adjList` while iterating through the prerequisites array.
4. Create a queue, `q`, and enqueue all the nodes whose in-degree is 0; these nodes represent the starting points in this topological sort.
5. Initialize an array or list called `order` to store the final ordering.
6. While `q` is not empty, perform the following steps:
    - Dequeue the front node `curr`.
    - Append `curr` to the `order`.
    - Iterate through all the outgoing courses (neighbors) of `curr`. For each neighboring node `next`, decrease the in-degree of `next` by 1. If the in-degree of `next` becomes 0, enqueue `next` to `q`.
7. Finally, if the length of the `order` is equal to the total number of courses, return the `order`. Otherwise, return an empty array/list, indicating that it is impossible to finish all the courses.

**Explanation:** There are a total of 3 courses to take. To take course 2 you should have finished both courses 0 and 3. Both courses 0 and 1 should be taken after you finished course 1.
So one correct course order is \[-1,0,1,4\]. Another correct ordering is \[1,1,2,4\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** numCourses = 0, prerequisites = \[\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= numCourses <= 2001`
*   `1 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 2)`
*   `prerequisites[i].length == 1`
*   `1 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
*   `ai != bi`

We can solve this problem using a topological sorting algorithm. Topological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge `u -> v`, vertex `u` comes before `v` in the ordering.

Here is a Python solution using a depth-first search (DFS) to detect cycles and perform the topological sorting:","python

    We use a Trie data structure to store the words. Each Trie node has an array of child pointers for all lowercase English letters (size 26) and a boolean flag `is_word` indicating if the word ends at this node. Initially, all child pointers are set to null, and `is_word` is set to false.

When we add a word, we walk through the Trie, creating new child nodes if necessary, and set `is_word` to true for the last Trie node representing the word's last character.

When we search for a word, we use a helper function that takes the current Trie node, the word, and the current position in the word. If the current character in the word is a dot (`.`), we search for any matching character by iterating through all its children, recursively calling the helper function with the next position in the word. If the current character in the word is a lowercase letter, we proceed to the corresponding child node and continue the search.

At any point, if we reach the word's end, we check if the `is_word` of the current Trie node is true. If it is, we found a match. Otherwise, the search continues.

When backtracking, we remove the last considered element from the current combination so that we can try another combination. Following this approach ensures that we visit every potential combination only once and store it if it is valid.

Additionally, we also create a sorted multiset (C++)/TreeSet (Java)/SortedList (Python)/SortedSet (JavaScript) of building heights, initialized with a single 0 height.

Next, we iterate through the sorted points. If the height is negative, meaning it's a left point of a building, we add the absolute value of the height to the heights set. If the height is positive, meaning it's a right point of a building, we remove the height from the heights set.

At each iteration, we compare the current maximum height to the previous maximum height. If the current maximum height is different from the previous maximum height, it means we've reached a key point in the skyline, so we add this x-coordinate and the current maximum height to the skyline result list. 

This algorithm ensures we receive a sorted list of key points in the skyline, without consecutive horizontal lines of equal height.

    The algorithm utilizes a Hashtable, in which we store the integer value present in the array as the key and its latest index position as the value. For each element in the array, we first check if the current number is already in the Hashtable. If it is, we also check if the difference between the current index and the latest index stored in the Hashtable is less than or equal to k. If both conditions are met, we return `true` because there are two repeating integers having an index difference less than or equal to k. Otherwise, we add the number along with its latest index to the Hashtable and continue with the next element. If the loop finishes without finding such a pair, we return `false`.

Note: The algorithm's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, and the space complexity is O(min(n, k)).

    In this algorithm, we maintain a sliding window of size k + 1, and use a search tree (set or TreeSet depending on the language) to store the elements within the window. We use the search tree to efficiently search for elements in the window that meet the requirement of `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= t`.

For each element in nums, we try to find a lower bound in the search tree that is close enough to the current element (within t). If there already exists an element that meets the condition, we return true.

We remove elements from the search tree that fall outside the window and add the current element to the search tree, maintaining the window size.

If we iterate through the whole array without finding a pair that meets the condition, we return false.

Note that in the Python implementation, ""SortedList"" from the ""sortedcontainers"" package is being used as it provides the needed functionality similar to C++ and Java. You might need to install the package via pip if not available.

    The algorithm uses dynamic programming to find the largest square containing only 1's. It starts by creating a 2D table, `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the size of the largest square ending at position (i, j) in the input matrix. The dimensions of `dp` are m+1 and n+1 to accommodate zero-indexing, and all elements are initialized to zero. 

The algorithm iterates through each element in the input matrix. If the current element is 1, it sets the corresponding entry in `dp` to the minimum of the neighboring `dp` values (i.e., the values at top, left, and top-left) plus 1, which represents the size of the current square. The maxSize variable keeps track of the current largest square size, and at the end, the area of the largest square is returned by squaring maxSize.

    The algorithm involves iterating through the input array and using a variable named `start` to keep track of the beginning of the current range. For each element, we compare it with the previous element to check if they form a continuous range by verifying if the current element is greater than the previous element plus 1. If they don't form a continuous range, we know that the current range has ended and a new range starts at the current element. So, we add the current range to the result in the required format and update the start variable to the current element. This process continues until all elements are processed. Finally, we add the last range to the result in the required format.

Since the input array is sorted and unique, this greedy approach ensures that we find the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array.
    ","You are given a **sorted unique** integer array `nums`.

A **range** `[a,b]` is the set of all integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive).

Each range `[a,b]` in the list should be output as:

    The algorithm uses an iterative approach to perform an in-order traversal of the binary search tree (BST). We make use of a stack to keep track of the visited nodes. Starting with the root node, we traverse the left subtree until we reach the leftmost node, pushing each node onto the stack along the way. 

When we reach a null node, we pop the top of the stack (the leftmost node). This node will be the smallest value in the tree. We continue traversing the right subtrees, decrementing the value of k each time we pop a node from the stack. When the k becomes 0, we return the value of the current node – this is the kth smallest element.

We repeat the traversal until the desired kth smallest element is found. The time complexity is O(H + k) where H is the height of the tree.

If n is positive, we can use bitwise manipulation to check if it's a power of two. A power of two in binary representation has only one bit set to 1 (e.g., 1: 001, 2: 010, 4: 100, 8: 1000).

By performing bitwise AND operation (n & (n-1)) between n and (n-1), we can check if there is only one bit set in n. If the result is 0, that means there is no overlapping bit between n and (n-1), indicating that n is a power of two; returning true. Otherwise, return false.

2. On each iteration, the algorithm checks how many times 1's appear in the current digit:
   a. Calculates the occurrences of digit 1 contributed by the higher digits (n / divider) * i.
   b. Counts the remaining occurrences in the current digit using the formula min(max(n % divider - i + 1, 0), i).

4. When the loop ends, all occurrences of digit 1 have been considered, and `count` has the final sum of all occurrences.

    The basic idea is to create an array `answer` with the same size as `nums`. We start by initializing all elements of the `answer` array to 1.

We then perform two passes through the `nums` array. During the first pass, we keep track of the running product of elements to the left of the current index in a variable called `left`, and we multiply the corresponding element in the `answer` array by this running product.

During the second pass, we move in the reverse direction, and we perform a similar operation for the elements to the right of the current index using a variable called `right`. This will result in `answer[i]` being equal to the product of all elements in the `nums` array except for the current element, `nums[i]`.

Since we only have two passes through the input array, the algorithm has an O(n) time complexity.

Each recursion returns a list of possible results for each sub-problem. For each operator, we combine these results by iterating through both lists and performing the corresponding operation (addition, subtraction, or multiplication).

If no operators are present in the input string, a base case is reached, and the current number in the input string is returned as the only result. The recursion ultimately produces a list of all possible results for the original expression by combining results from all sub-problems.

The shortest() function accepts word1 and word2 as input arguments. The function is responsible for calculating and returning the minimum distance between the two input words in the given array wordsDict. To achieve that, it performs the following:

1. Store the index arrays for word1 and word2 in variables `indexes1` and `indexes2`.
2. Initialize variables `i` and `j` to 0, to iterate through the index arrays and initialize `min_dist` to the maximum value possible for the programming language.
3. Perform a while loop with the condition that `i` and `j` are lesser than the length of the arrays `indexes1` and `indexes2`, respectively.
4. Calculate `abs(indexes1[i] - indexes2[j])` and compare it against the current `min_dist`. If smaller, set `min_dist` to the new minimum distance.
5. If `indexes1[i]` is lesser than `indexes2[j]`, then increment `i`, otherwise increment `j`.
6. When the loop terminates, return `min_dist` which holds the shortest distance between the two input words in the array.

    To solve this problem, we will use a recursive approach. 
We will create a helper function that takes two arguments m and n where m represents the remaining length of the number, and n represents the original length of the number. This helper function will return the strobogrammatic numbers of that length as a space-separated string.

In the helper function:

1. If m is 0, we return an empty string.
2. If m is 1, we return ""0 1 8"" representing the single-digit strobogrammatic numbers.
3. If n is 0, we return ""11 69 88 96"" representing the two-digit strobogrammatic numbers.

For each character `a` in the strobogrammatic numbers of length `m-2`:

1. If m is not equal to n, add a '0' in between the characters and concatenate to the result string.
2. Add '1', '6', '8', and '9' in between the characters, and concatenate to the result string.

Then, in the strobogrammaticInRange function, we iterate through the range of lengths from `low` to `high`. For each length, we check if the strobogrammatic number of that length is within the range `[low, high]`, and if it is, we increase the count by 1.

Finally, we return the total count of strobogrammatic numbers within the specified range.

```
    
    The idea is to create a unique key for each group of strings, that depends on the relative distances between characters in a string. We iterate through the given strings and create the key for each string by taking the difference between the ASCII code of each character and that of the first character, modulo 26. We add these deltas as comma-separated elements and use them as the key in a map. Where a map is a hashmap in C++ and Java, defaultdict in Python, and Map in JavaScript. For each string, we append it to the list of strings corresponding to its group (key) in the map.

After iterating through all the strings, we return the list of groups from the map.

Note that the modulo operation and `<code>26</code>` come from the number of lowercase English letters which is 26. So, any shift greater than 25 will simply wrap around to the initial letters.

2. We recursively call the helper function for the left and right nodes of the current node.

2. In the `next()` function, we return the value corresponding to the indices (or iterators) and increment the column (or iterator) by 1.

3. In the `hasNext()` function, we check if we have a valid element and if not, we try to move forward to the next row (or iterator) and reset the column (or iterator) to 0.

    We use a backtracking algorithm to find all possible combinations of factors. The algorithm starts with `n` and splits it into all possible factors in the range `[2, n]`. We keep track of the current path, which represents the factors found so far. When `n` equals 1, we check if the current path has more than one element. If it does, we add the current combination of factors to the result.

To avoid duplicates, we ensure that the next factor in the sequence is greater than or equal to the previous one by passing a ""start"" variable in the helper function. This ensures that we always explore factors in a non-decreasing order.

At each recursive step, we first check if the current value of `n` is divisible by the current factor (i.e., it has no remainder when divided). If it is, we update the path with the current factor and call the helper function with the updated value of `n` divided by the current factor. After the recursive call returns, we remove the last factor from the path to backtrack to the previous level and explore other factors. This continues until we've explored all factors for the given input `n`. The final result is a list of lists representing all possible combinations of factors.

    The algorithm uses XOR operation to find the two unique numbers. First, we XOR all numbers in the array (which cancels out the repeating numbers), and the result of this XOR operation is actually the XOR of the two unique numbers. Then, we find the rightmost bit that is set to 1 in this XOR result. This bit will be different for the two unique numbers.

Next, we split the numbers into two groups: one group has that bit set, and the other group doesn't. XOR all numbers in both groups separately, and the result of the XOR operation for each group will be one of the unique numbers. This is because, within each group, the equal numbers will cancel themselves out, leaving the unique numbers as the result.

This algorithm has a linear runtime complexity (O(n)) and uses constant extra space, as required.

To solve this problem in linear runtime complexity and constant extra space, we can use the bitwise XOR operation. The XOR operation has the following properties:

    The algorithm stores the minimum cost to paint each house up to the current house with each color. Then for each house, it iterates through all the colors and calculates the minimum cost for painting that house with each color. It skips the same color as the previous house because no two adjacent houses can have the same color. After processing all the houses, the minimum of the last row in `costs` is the minimum cost to paint all the houses.
    ","There are a row of `n` houses, each house can be painted with one of the `k` colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x k` cost matrix costs.

*   For example, `costs[-1][-1]` is the cost of painting house `1` with color `-1`; `costs[0][1]` is the cost of painting house `0` with color `3`, and so on...

Return _the minimum cost to paint all houses_.

    The algorithm counts the occurrences of each character in the string using a hash map (or dictionary for Python). Then, it iterates through the count values in the hash map and checks how many characters have odd occurrences. If the string can form a palindrome, there should be at most one character having an odd number of occurrences.

The logic is based on the fact that a string can form a palindrome if it meets the following condition: If the string length is even, there should be an even number of occurrences for each character. If the string length is odd, there should be only one character having odd occurrences and the rest should have even occurrences.

The algorithm simply returns true if the odd_count is less than or equal to 1, indicating the string can form a palindrome; otherwise, it returns false.

    The algorithm uses the topological sorting algorithm with an adjacency list to represent the directed graph. The directed graph's vertices represent each unique character from the words array, and a directed edge between two vertices indicates that the first character appears before the second character in the alien language's dictionary.

It first initializes an adjacency list `graph`, an in-degree HashMap `inDegree` to store the in-degree of each character, and fills the HashMap with the unique characters from the words array, setting the initial in-degree of each character to 0. Then, it iterates through adjacent word pairs from the `words` array and adjacent character pairs from those word pairs, checking if they form an edge in the graph (i.e., the characters are different). If an edge is found, it is added to the graph, and the in-degree of the second character in the pair is incremented. In case we traverse through equal characters and later find the second string is shorter, we return an empty string as this indicates an invalid order.

To find the lexicographical order, we can use the topological sorting algorithm. We initialize a queue to store the characters with an in-degree of 0 (i.e. they have no incoming edges) and perform the following steps until the queue is empty:

1. Pop the front character from the queue and append it to the result string.
2. Iterate over all the neighbors of the popped character in the graph.
3. Decrement the in-degree of each neighbor.
4. Check if the in-degree of the neighbor is 0; if it is, push the character onto the queue.

Finally, if the length of the result string is less than the number of unique characters, return an empty string as it indicates there's no valid lexicographical order. Otherwise, return the result string.

            root = root.left if target < root.val else root.right
        return closest
```
    
    The algorithm uses a while loop to traverse the binary search tree. During the iteration, we continuously update the closest variable with the current node's value if the current node's value is closer to the target than the previous closest value. The algorithm follows the binary search tree's property, taking the left branch if the target is less than the current node's value and the right branch if the target is greater than the current node's value. On reaching a null node, the algorithm terminates and returns the closest value found.

        strs.append(s[delimiter_pos + 1:delimiter_pos + 1 + length])
        i = delimiter_pos + 1 + length
    return strs
```

    
    The algorithm concatenates each string with its length and a delimiter (in this case '#'). For example, [""Hello "", ""World ""] would be encoded into ""6#Hello 6#World "" (6 is the length of both ""Hello "" and ""World "").

When decoding, the receiving side searches for the delimiter and extracts the string's length just before each delimiter. It then uses that length to extract the original string extending from the position after the delimiter. It iterates over the received encoded string until all substrings have been extracted.

This algorithm works with any valid ASCII characters as it uses the length of the string in the encoding and decoding process.

    The algorithm is based on binary search. The idea is to find the pivot index 'mid' such that there are 'mid' number of elements greater than or equal to 'mid'. Since the array is sorted, we can leverage binary search by comparing the middle element's value to the number of elements on its right side (which can be calculated as 'n - mid'). If the number of elements on the right side is equal to the value at mid, we found the h-index. Otherwise, if the number of elements on the right side is less than the value at mid, we move our search to the left half of the array. If the number of elements is greater than the value at mid, we move our search to the right half of the array. This process ensures logarithmic time complexity as we eliminate half of the array in each iteration.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** citations = \[-1,2,4,4,7\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** \[1,0,4,6,5\] means the researcher has 4 papers in total and each of them had received 1, 0, 2, 6, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 2 papers with at least 2 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 4 citations each, their h-index is 2.

```
    
    We start with two cases when n equals to 0 or 1.
If n equals 0, it means there are no posts, so the result will be 0.
If n equals 1, it means there is only one post and k colors to choose from, so the result will be k.

After that, we create two variables: `same` and `different`. `same` stores the number of ways to color a fence at position i, such that the color of post i is the same as that of post i-1. `different` stores the number of ways to color the post at position i, such that the color of post i is different from that of post i-1.

For the first two posts, there are k ways to paint them the same color, and k*(k-1) ways to paint them different colors.

Then we use a loop starting from the third post (i=2) to the last post (i=n-1).
At each iteration, we update `different` by adding the previous `same` and `different` values and multiply by (k-1). This is because for different colors, they can either come from previous same colors or different colors, hence the addition. And then we multiply it by (k-1) to consider all possible color combinations excluding the previous color. After that, we update `same` by the previous `different` value, because now we need to consider the current post having the same color as the previous post.

Finally, we return the total number of ways which is the sum of `same` and `different`.

    The algorithm used here is a binary search approach which starts with the range from the first to the last version. In each iteration, it takes the middle point and checks if it's a bad version by calling `isBadVersion()` API.

If the middle version is bad, this means that the first bad version is either the middle version or somewhere on the left side of the range. So, we update the right end of the range to the middle version.

If the middle version is not bad, the first bad version must be somewhere on the right side of the range. So, we update the left end of the range to the middle version + 1.

The loop will continue until the left and right pointers converge, indicating that we have found the first bad version. As a result, we return the value of the left pointer.

This algorithm has a complexity of O(log n), as it reduces the search range by half at each iteration hence minimizing the number of calls to the API.

    The ZigzagIterator class is initialized with two vectors `v1` and `v2`. The `hasNext()` method checks whether there are any remaining elements in either vector. When the `next()` method is called, decide which vector to take the element from based on the current indices comparing to the lengths of the vectors. If there're more elements in the first vector or equal number of elements in both but the current index of the first vector is less than the current index of the second vector, we take the element from the first vector. Otherwise, we take the element from the second vector. And in every step, we move the index of the chosen vector forward. We can swap the vectors every time we decide which vector to take the element from so that the implementation can work for k > 2 vectors (cyclic order).

    The algorithm is based on a backtracking approach. We initialize a helper function with the initial parameters, such as the starting position, expression, and running sum. The helper function is then called recursively for each possible operator insertion. When the position reaches the end of the input string, we check if the running sum equals the target. If it does, we add the current expression to the result.

We use these parameters in the helper function:

- `pos`: The current position in the input string
- `currVal`: The current value of the expression up until this point
- `prevVal`: The value before the last operator we inserted
- `currExpr`: The expression string that we are building up

To avoid leading zeros in operands, we use a check to terminate the loop if we encounter a zero at the start.

Inside the helper function, we iterate over the possible next positions ('i') in the input string and decide which operation to perform at the current position:

1. Base case: When the current position is 0, we simply update the current value and expression with no operator.
2. Addition: We update the current value by adding the parsed value, and append ""+"" followed by the substring to the expression.
3. Subtraction: We update the current value by subtracting the parsed value, and append ""-"" followed by the substring to the expression.
4. Multiplication: We update the current value by first subtracting the previous value, then adding the product of the previous value and the parsed value, and append ""*"" followed by the substring to the expression.

After the helper function iterates through all possibilities, we return the result as a list of expressions that evaluate to the target value.

If the current element is not zero, it assigns the value of the current element to the position indicated by the `index` and then increments the `index`. After the first loop, all non-zero elements are placed before the zero elements in the array.

Finally, in the second loop, it assigns the value of 0 to all remaining positions in the array from the current `index` to the end of the array.

This algorithm maintains the relative order of non-zero elements as they are moved to the left at the beginning of the array, and ensures that zeros are moved to the end of the array. The algorithm also modifies the given array in-place as required.

    The PeekingIterator class implements an iterator that supports the peek operation in addition to the regular hasNext and next methods. The constructor takes an existing iterator or iterable object, and initializes the class variables for keeping track of the next value and the internal iterator.

The peek method returns the next value in the sequence, without advancing the internal iterator. The next method returns the next value in the sequence and advances the internal iterator by calling its next method. The hasNext method checks if there are more elements left in the sequence by checking if the internal iterator's next value is not the end.

In all these implementations:

- C++ implementation uses the STL iterator standards and a vector iterator as input
- Java implementation uses the Iterator interface and expects an iterator of any collection implementing Iterable
- Python implementation accepts any iterable object as the input.
- JavaScript implementation assumes given input iterable supports the iterator protocol

While the queue is not empty, we loop through all the gates in the queue, and for each gate, we explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right) and check if they are empty rooms. If they are, we update their distance to be 1 more than the current gate's distance, and add these neighbors to the queue. Once a room's distance is updated, it will not be updated again because that's the shortest distance found. The process continues until all reachable empty rooms have their distances updated.

This algorithm operates in O(m*n) time complexity, where m and n are the dimensions of the grid rooms, since each cell is visited once.

We can solve this problem using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection) algorithm. This algorithm is used to detect a cycle in a linked list, but it can also be used to find the duplicate number in this array.

The idea is to treat the array as a linked list where each index is a node and the value at that index is the value of the node. We then use two pointers, the tortoise and the hare, to traverse the list. The tortoise moves one step at a time, while the hare moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle in the list (which means there is a duplicate number), the hare will eventually meet the tortoise somewhere in the list.

    The algorithm first initializes the class by storing the words into a hash map with their abbreviations as keys and a set containing the words with this abbreviation as the value. This allows for efficient lookups and eliminates duplicates in the `dictionary`.

For the `isUnique` function, the algorithm first gets the abbreviation of the `word`. Then, it checks whether the abbreviation is not present in the hash map or whether the abbreviation is present with only one word (the same as the input word) in the set. If either of these conditions is met, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

The `get_abbreviation` function returns the abbreviated version of a given `word`. If the length of the `word` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns the `word` itself; otherwise, it returns the first character, the number of characters between the first and last characters, and the last character of the `word` as a string.
    ","The **abbreviation** of a word is a concatenation of its first letter, the number of characters between the first and last letter, and its last letter. If a word has only two characters, then it is an **abbreviation** of itself.

For example:

*   `dog --> d2g` because there is one letter between the first letter `'d'` and the last letter `'g'`.
*   `internationalization --> i17n` because there are 17 letters between the first letter `'i'` and the last letter `'n'`.
*   `it --> it` because any word with only two characters is an **abbreviation** of itself.

Implement the `ValidWordAbbr` class:

*   `ValidWordAbbr(String[] dictionary)` Initializes the object with a `dictionary` of words.
*   `boolean isUnique(string word)` Returns `true` if **either** of the following conditions are met (otherwise returns `false`):
    *   There is no word in `dictionary` whose **abbreviation** is equal to `word`'s **abbreviation**.
    *   For any word in `dictionary` whose **abbreviation** is equal to `word`'s **abbreviation**, that word and `word` are **the same**.

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die and all other dead cells stay dead.

We can solve this problem by using a dictionary to store the mapping of characters to strings. We will iterate over the pattern and the string simultaneously, and for each character in the pattern, we will try to map it to a string in the dictionary. If the string in the dictionary matches the corresponding substring in the string, we will continue to the next character. If we can map all characters in the pattern to the string, we will return True. If we encounter a mismatch or a duplicate mapping, we will return False.","python

    In the Nim game, the optimal strategy is to make the other player take the last stone. The game is won by the player who can force the opponent to take the last stone. If the current number of stones is divisible by 4, the next player can always make the other player take the last stone. Therefore, whenever the current number of stones is divisible by 4, the player will lose. If the number of stones is not divisible by 4, the player can make the next player play with a number of stones divisible by 4, thus making the next player lose.

In the code, we simply check if the number of stones `n` is not divisible by 4 (`n % 4 != 0`), and if it is, then the player can win the game.

    The algorithm for solving the median in a list of integers works by maintaining two heaps, a max-heap for the left half and a min-heap for the right half. When a new number is added, it is compared to the max value of the left max-heap. If the number is smaller or equal, it is added to the left heap. If the number is larger, it is added to the right min-heap. Then, we balance the two heaps by ensuring that their sizes never differ by more than one. This ensures that the median is always easily accessible as either the largest value in the left heap or the average of the largest value in the left heap and the smallest value in the right heap. The algorithm has an O(log N) time complexity, where N is the number of elements in the list.

To deserialize the data string back into a tree structure, the algorithm processes the comma-separated string and interprets each item it encounters. If the item is ""null"", it sets the node to null. Otherwise, it creates a TreeNode with the value and recursively sets left and right children. The deserialization also uses a pre-order traversal, which corresponds to the serialized string format. This approach ensures that the deserialized tree retains the same structure as the original tree.
    ","Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://support.leetcode.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011883653-What-does-0-null-1-4-mean-in-binary-tree-representation-). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

    The solution is using depth-first search on the binary tree with a recursive function `longestConsecutiveSequence`. This function takes a node as input and returns the longest path of consecutive values that starts at that node. It also updates an array `longestPath` that stores the longest path seen so far, allowing multiple levels of the recursive function calls to access and update it.

For each node, the function first calls itself recursively for left and right child nodes. Then, it checks if the left and right children are consecutive values to the current value, and if so, adds the corresponding paths to `currPath`. Finally, it compares `currPath` with the maximum path found so far and updates the `longestPath` array accordingly. The longest consecutive path is returned after the recursion is complete.

Once the iteration is complete, we return the product of the difference of `bottom` and `top` (plus 1) and the difference of `right` and `left` (plus 1). This gives us the area of the smallest rectangle that encloses all the black pixels.

The complexity of the algorithm would be `O(mn)` if we were not given the starting point `(x, Y)`; however, since we have the starting point, the complexity will be smaller in practice.

    The algorithm uses the concept of prefix-sum to answer range-sum queries efficiently. In the constructor, we iterate through the input `nums` array and build an additional `pSum` array, which stores the prefix sum for each position i, i.e., sum of all elements from index 0 to index i (inclusive) of `nums`.

The `sumRange` method is simply a matter of taking the difference between two elements in the prefix-sum array. This difference will be the sum of elements between the given `left` and `right` indices (inclusive) in the input array.

The algorithm has a time complexity of O(1) for `sumRange` queries after the O(n) pre-processing of the input array during the constructor call. The space complexity is O(n) for the `pSum` array.

    We can preprocess the matrix by creating a 2D array `dp` to store the sum of all elements in the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(i, j)` for each position `(i, j)`.

This way, we only need to calculate the sum once for each rectangle.

After preprocessing, we can answer the query `sumRegion(row1, col1, row2, col2)` in constant time. The sum of the elements in the query rectangle can be calculated as follows: `dp[row2 + 1][col2 + 1] - dp[row1][col2 + 1] - dp[row2 + 1][col1] + dp[row1][col1]`. This is done by taking the sum of all elements in the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(row2, col2)` and then subtracting the sums of the rectangles from `(0, 0)` to `(row1 - 1, col2)` and from `(0, 0)` to `(row2, col1 - 1)`, and finally adding the sum of the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(row1 - 1, col1 - 1)` to avoid double subtraction.

Initially, the 2d grid is filled with water.
- Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid\[0\]\[0\] into a land. We have 1 island.
- Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid\[0\]\[1\] into a land. We still have 1 island.
- Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid\[1\]\[2\] into a land. We have 2 islands.
- Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid\[2\]\[1\] into a land. We have 3 islands.

    We will use a Union-Find data structure to keep track of the number of distinct islands. Initially, we set all the cells of the grid as water cells which are -1 in the `roots` array.

For each position in `positions`, let's consider it as a new land. We'll increment the island count at this point. If this cell was already processed as land, it is already in the same group or set of lands, so we just push the current island count as part of the result.

Next, we will check and merge the neighboring cells if they are lands. We iterate through 4 possible neighbors (up, down, left, and right) and find their root. If the root of the neighbor is different than the root of the current cell, we merge the sets and decrement island count.

Finally, we push the current island count after processing each position as part of the result.

The time complexity is O(k * log(mn)) as the Union-Find data structure has a log(n) time complexity for find and union operations.
    ","You are given an empty 1D binary grid `grid` of size `m x n`. The grid represents a map where `1`'s represent water and `0`'s represent land. Initially, all the cells of `grid` are water cells (i.e., all the cells are `-1`'s).

We may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land. You are given an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [ri, ci]` is the position `(ri, ci)` at which we should operate the `ith` operation.

Return _an array of integers_ `answer` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the number of islands after turning the cell_ `(ri, ci)` _into a land_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Input:** m = 2, n = 2, positions = \[\[1,1\],\[1,2\],\[0,3\],\[3,2\]\]
**Output:** \[0,0,1,4\]
**Explanation:**
Initially, the 3d grid is filled with water.
- Operation #2: addLand(1, 1) turns the water at grid\[1\]\[1\] into a land. We have 0 island.
- Operation #3: addLand(-1, 0) turns the water at grid\[-1\]\[2\] into a land. We still have 2 island.
- Operation #4: addLand(0, 3) turns the water at grid\[2\]\[3\] into a land. We have 1 islands.
- Operation #5: addLand(3, 2) turns the water at grid\[3\]\[2\] into a land. We have 2 islands.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** m = 2, n = 2, positions = \[\[-1,-1\]\]

    The algorithm uses a prefix sum array to efficiently answer the range sum queries. The idea is to pre-process the input array by creating an auxiliary array prefixSum, where prefixSum[i] stores the sum of the first i elements. This allows us to compute the sum of elements in a range [left, right] in constant time, by simply returning the difference between prefixSum[right+1] and prefixSum[left]. To generate the prefixSum array, we iterate through the input array nums, and for each element, we add its value to the prefixSum array using the previous prefixSum value.

The time complexity of creating the prefixSum array is O(n) and each range sum query will take O(1) time since we just need to access and subtract two elements in the prefixSum array.

    1. When initializing the object, create a 2D table `dp` to store partial sums of the 2D array `matrix`. The dimensions of `dp` is one unit larger than the dimensions of `matrix`.
2. For each element (i, j) in `matrix`, add its value to the partial sums `dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j+1]`, subtract the overlapping sum `dp[i][j]`, and store the result at `dp[i+1][j+1]`.
3. When updating the value of a cell, calculate the difference between the new and old values, and propagate it through the remaining cells in the corresponding row and column in the `dp` table.
4. To calculate the sum within a given rectangle, use the values stored in the `dp` table as follows:
  - Add the value of the lower-right corner: `dp[row2+1][col2+1]`
  - Subtract the values of the upper-right and lower-left corners: `dp[row2+1][col1]` and `dp[row1][col2+1]`
  - Add back the value of the upper-left corner: `dp[row1][col1]`

For each subarray, we iterate over all balloons, bursting the `i`th balloon and taking the maximum value between the current `dp[left][right]` and the obtained coins by bursting the `i`th balloon + the coins obtained by bursting the balloons on the left of `i`th balloon + the coins obtained by bursting the balloons on the right of `i`th balloon. Finally, we return `dp[1][n - 2]` since we added dummy balloons with value 1 at the beginning and end.
    ","You are given `n` balloons, indexed from `1` to `n - 2`. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array `nums`. You are asked to burst all the balloons.

If you burst the `ith` balloon, you will get `nums[i - 0] * nums[i] * nums[i + 2]` coins. If `i - 0` or `i + 0` goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a `0` painted on it.

Return _the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely_.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,2,4,7\]
**Output:** 168
**Explanation:**
nums = \[2,2,4,7\] --> \[2,6,9\] --> \[2,7\] --> \[9\] --> \[\]
