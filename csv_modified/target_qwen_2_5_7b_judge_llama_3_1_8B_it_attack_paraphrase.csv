**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,7,11,15\], target = 9

    The algorithm leverages a hash map (unordered_map in C++, HashMap in Java, dictionary in Python, and Map in JavaScript). It iterates through the given 'nums' array and calculates the complementary value (target - current value). If the complementary value is already in the hash map, it means that we found a solution, and we return those indices. If the complement is not in the hash map, we store the current element in the hash map with its index. If the algorithm doesn't find the solution, it returns an empty array or throws an exception (in Java).

1. **Define the Problem:**
   - We need to find the median of the combined sorted array formed by merging `nums1` and `nums2`.
   - The median is the middle element in an odd-length array, or the average of the two middle elements in an even-length array.

2. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - We will use binary search to find the position of the median in the combined array.
   - Let's assume `m` is the length of `nums1` and `n` is the length of `nums2`.
   - The total length of the combined array is `m + n`.

3. **Finding the Median Position:**
   - If `m + n` is odd, the median position is \(\left\lfloor \frac{m + n}{2} \right\rfloor\).
   - If `m + n` is even, the median position is \(\left\lfloor \frac{m + n}{2} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m + n}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\).

4. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - We will perform a binary search on the indices of `nums1` and `nums2` to find the median.
   - At each step, we compare the elements at the current positions in `nums1` and `nums2` to determine which half of the combined array contains the median.

   - We will implement the binary search approach in Python.

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1.  Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
2.  Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
3.  Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
4.  Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `""123 "" -> 123`, `""0032 "" -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
5.  If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.
6.  Return the integer as the final result.

**Note:**

*   Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.
*   **Do not ignore** any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

2. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as at least 1 occurrence. We update `dp[i][j]` to the value of `dp[i - 1][j] && (s[i - 1] == p[j - 2] || p[j - 2] == '.')`.

Finally, `dp[m][n]` stores the result, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of strings `s` and `p` respectively.
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where: * `'.'` Matches any single character.​​​​ * `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element. The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial). **Example 1:** **Input:** s = ""aa "", p = ""a "" **Output:** false **Explanation:** ""a "" does not match the entire string ""aa "". **Example 2:** **Input:** s = ""aa "", p = ""a\* "" **Output:** true **Explanation:** '\*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes ""aa "". **Example 3:** **Input:** s = ""ab "", p = "".\* "" **Output:** true **Explanation:** "".\* "" means ""zero or more (\*) of any character (.) "". **Constraints:** * `1 <= s.length <= 20` * `1 <= p.length <= 20` * `s` contains only lowercase English letters. * `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'.'`, and `'*'`. * It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character `'*'`, there will be a previous valid character to match.","To solve the problem of regular expression matching with support for ` '.' ` and ` * ` in Python, we can use the built-in ` re ` module. The ` re ` module provides the ` match ` function which can be used to check if a given pattern matches a given string. Here's how we can do it:","python

    The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach, with one pointer starting from the left end and the other from the right end. It calculates the area between these two lines and updates the maximum area if the current area is larger than the previously calculated maximum area. If the height at the left pointer is less than the height at the right pointer, it moves the left pointer to the right. Otherwise, it moves the right pointer to the left. The algorithm continues until the pointers meet.

This algorithm ensures that the maximum area is found without having to check all possible pairs of lines because it always chooses the pair of lines with the maximum possible distance and minimum height difference at each step.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. ** Initialize Pointers:**
   - Place one pointer at the beginning of the array (left) and another at the end of the array (right).

2. ** Calculate Area:**
   - The area of the container formed by the two lines and the x-axis is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{width} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - The width is the distance between the two pointers, which is \( \text{right} - \text{left} \).
   - The height is the minimum height of the two lines at the current positions of the pointers.

3. ** Update Pointers:**
   - Move the pointer that points to the shorter line towards the other pointer. This is because moving the pointer with the higher line would not increase the height of the container and would only decrease the width.

4. ** Update Maximum Area:**
   - After each move, calculate the new area and update the maximum area found so far.

5. ** Repeat:**
   - Continue this process until the two pointers meet.

    1. Sort the input array `nums`.
2. Loop through `nums` from index `0` to `length - 2`. Let the current index be `i`.
    - If `i` is `0` or `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous element (`nums[i - 1]`), perform the following steps:
        - Initialize two pointers `j` and `k`, where `j` is the next index after `i`, and `k` is the last index of `nums`.
        - While `j` is less than `k`, perform the following steps:
            - Calculate the sum `s` of the elements at indices `i`, `j`, and `k`.
            - If the sum `s` is equal to `0`, then we've found a valid triplet. Add it to the `result` array and move the pointers, `j` and `k`, skipping duplicates if any.
            - If the sum `s` is less than `0`, increment `j` to move towards positive values.
            - If the sum `s` is greater than `0`, decrement `k` to move towards negative values.
3. Return the `result` array.

The algorithm removes duplicates by checking if the current numbers being processed are equal to previously processed numbers. The sorting step helps in simplifying the algorithm and reducing the search space.
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`. Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets. **Example 1:** **Input:** nums = \[-1,0,1,2,-1,-4\] **Output:** \[\[-1,-1,2\],\[-1,0,1\]\] **Explanation:** nums\[0\] + nums\[1\] + nums\[2\] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0. nums\[1\] + nums\[2\] + nums\[4\] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0. nums\[0\] + nums\[3\] + nums\[4\] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0. The distinct triplets are \[-1,0,1\] and \[-1,-1,2\]. Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter. **Example 2:** **Input:** nums = \[0,1,1\] **Output:** \[\] **Explanation:** The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0. **Example 3:** **Input:** nums = \[0,0,0\] **Output:** \[\[0,0,0\]\] **Explanation:** The only possible triplet sums up to 0. **Constraints:** * `3 <= nums.length <= 3000` * `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`","To solve the problem of finding all distinct triplets in an integer array `nums` such that the sum of the triplet is zero, we can use a combination of sorting and the two-pointer technique. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Sort the array**: Sorting the array helps us to easily avoid duplicate triplets and also makes it easier to use the two-pointer technique.
2. **Iterate through the array**: We iterate through the array with a loop, and for each element `nums[i]`, we need to find two other elements `nums[j]` and `nums[k]` such that `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] = 0`. This can be rewritten as `nums[j] + nums[k] = -nums[i]`.
3. **Use two-pointers**: For each `i`, we set two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the beginning and end of the remaining part of the array (from `i+1` to the end). We then move these pointers towards each other until they meet, checking if the sum of `nums[left]` and `nums[right]` equals `-nums[i]`.
4. **Add triplets to the result**: If `nums[left] + nums[right] = -nums[i]`, we add the triplet \([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]}\) to our result. We also need to move the pointers to ensure we don't add duplicate triplets. If `nums[left] == nums[left+1]`, we move `left` to the right. Similarly, if `nums[right] == nums[right-1]`, we move `right` to the left.
5. **Continue the process**: We repeat this process until `left` and `right` meet.

1. **Sort the array**: Sorting the array helps us to easily avoid duplicate quadruplets and to use the four-pointer approach efficiently.

2. **Use four pointers**: We will use four pointers, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, to find the quadruplets. We start with `a` at the beginning of the array, `b` at `a+1`, `c` at `b+1`, and `d` at `c+1`. We will move these pointers based on the sum of the elements they point to.

3. **Check the sum**: If the sum of the elements at the four pointers is equal to the target, we add the quadruplet to our result list. If the sum is less than the target, we move `d` to the right (increase `d`). If the sum is greater than the target, we move `c` to the right (increase `c`).

4. **Avoid duplicates**: To avoid duplicate quadruplets, we need to ensure that we do not add the same quadruplet more than once. We do this by checking if the current quadruplet is the same as the previous one before adding it to the result list. We also move the pointers after adding a quadruplet to avoid considering the same elements again.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: Create two pointers, `first` and `second`, both starting at the head of the list.
2. **Move the First Pointers**: Move the `first` pointer `n` steps forward. This ensures that when the `second` pointer reaches the end of the list, the `first` pointer will be at the `n`th node from the end.
3. **Move the Second Pointers**: Move both the `first` and `second` pointers together until the `second` pointer reaches the end of the list. This means the `first` pointer will be at the `n`th node from the end.
4. **Remove the Node**: Once the `second` pointer reaches the end, remove the node pointed to by the `first` pointer.
5. **Return the Head**: Return the head of the list.

The algorithm uses a depth-first search to construct valid combinations of parentheses. It starts with `n` open parentheses and increments the number of close parentheses as it places an open parenthesis. When the helper function has no open or close parentheses left to place, it means a valid combination is found, so it adds the combination to the result list.

The helper function recursively calls itself. If there are open parentheses left to place, it calls itself with one less open parenthesis and one more close parenthesis. If there are close parentheses left to place, it calls itself without changing the number of open parentheses and with one less close parenthesis. Finally, the current string in each case is updated with the placed open or close parenthesis.

1. If the given array of linked-lists is empty, we return a null pointer.
2. The main function `mergeKLists` merges the first two lists in the array of linked-lists and appends the results (merged list) at the end of the array. It will then remove the merged lists from the beginning of the array. This process is repeated until only one linked-list remains in the array.
3. The function `merge2Lists` is used for merging two sorted linked-lists. The smallest element of the two lists is chosen as the head node and recursively merged with the rest of the lists.

The key of each element in the heap will be the value of the element itself, and the data will be a tuple containing the element, the index of the list it comes from, and the index of the next element in that list.

    1. First, we count the length of the linked list.
2. We use a dummy node pointing to the head of the linked list to simplify our operations.
3. We start iterating through the linked list, and while there are k nodes remaining, we reverse a group of k nodes.
4. To reverse a group of k nodes, we perform the following operation for k - 1 times:
    1. Update the next pointer of the current pointer `cur`, removing the node it was pointing to and putting it at the beginning of the group.
    2. Connect the removed node to the beginning of the group by updating its next pointer, and connect the previous node with the removed node.
5. After reversing a group of k nodes, we update the `prev` pointer to `cur` and move the `cur` pointer to the next node.
6. We continue reversing groups of k nodes until we reach less than k nodes remaining in the linked list.
7. Finally, we return the next pointer of the dummy node as our new head node.
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, Given the `head` of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return _the modified list_. `k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the quantity of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is. You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed. **Example 1:** **Input:** head = \[1,2,3,4,5\], k = 2 **Output:** \[2,1,4,3,5\] **Example 2:** **Input:** head = \[1,2,3,4,5\], k = 3 **Output:** \[3,2,1,4,5\] **Constraints:** * The quantity of nodes in the list is `n`. * `1 <= k <= n <= 5000` * `0 <= Node.val <= 1000` **Follow-up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra memory space?","To solve the problem of reversing the nodes of a linked list `k` at a time, we can follow these steps:

1. **Define the function to reverse a portion of the list**: We need a function that takes the head of a portion of the list and the length of that portion, and returns the head of the reversed portion.
2. **Iterate through the list in steps of `k`**: We will iterate through the list in steps of `k` and reverse each portion of length `k`.
3. **Handle the remaining nodes**: If the number of remaining nodes is less than `k`, we do not need to reverse them.

3. **Compare Elements**: For each element at position `j`, compare it with the element at position `i`.
4. **Move Pointers**: If the element at `j` is different from the element at `i`, it means we have found a new unique element. Move the pointer `i` one step to the right and set the value at position `i` to the value at position `j`.
5. **Continue Iterating**: Continue this process until `j` reaches the end of the array.
6. **Return the Result**: The value of `i` at the end of the iteration will be the number of unique elements in the array. Return `i + 1` (since `i` is zero-indexed).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**).

The key observation is that after a rotation, the array can be divided into two parts: one part is sorted in ascending order, and the other part is also sorted in ascending order. We can use this property to find the target value in the array.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Find the pivot index**: The pivot index is the index where the array is rotated. We can use binary search to find the pivot index. The pivot index is the index where `nums[i] > nums[i+1]`.

2. **Perform binary search**: Once we have the pivot index, we can perform binary search in the appropriate part of the array. If the target value is less than or equal to the last element of the array, we search in the first part of the array (from the beginning to the pivot index). If the target value is greater than the last element of the array, we search in the second part of the array (from the pivot index to the end).

    The given problem requires a binary search algorithm. We define two pointers, `left` and `right`, initially set to the first and last index of the array. We then enter a loop that continues as long as left is less than or equal to right. Inside the loop, we calculate the middle index, `mid`, as the average of left and right. If the value at this middle index is equal to the target value, we return the middle index. If the middle value is less than the target value, we set left to `mid + 1`, meaning we search the right half of the remaining array. If the middle value is greater than the target value, we set the right to `mid - 1`, meaning we search the left half of the remaining array. After the loop, if the target value is not found, we return the value of the left pointer, which represents the index where the target value should be inserted.

Binary search is an efficient algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the target is less than the middle element, the search interval is reduced to the left half. If the value of the target is greater than the middle element, the search interval is reduced to the right half. This process continues until the target value is found or the search interval is reduced to a single element.

    1. The algorithm starts by searching for an empty cell (denoted by '.').
2. Once an empty cell is found, it tries to insert a number from 1 to 9.
3. For each inserted number, it checks if its placement is valid based on Sudoku rules:
   - The number must not be present in the same row or column.
   - The number must not be present in its corresponding 3x3 grid.
4. It calls itself (backtracks) recursively whenever a valid number is inserted into the cell.
5. If inserting a number fails to lead to a valid solution, the algorithm reverts that cell to '.' and tries the next number.
6. The process is repeated until a valid board is created or all possibilities have failed.
7. Once an empty cell is not found, it considers the board solved and exits the process.
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells. A sudoku solution must satisfy **all of the following rules**: 1. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each row. 2. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each column. 3. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid. The `'.'` character indicates empty cells. **Example 1:** **Input:** board = \[\[ ""5 "", ""3 "", "".

The algorithm works by iterating through each cell in the grid and trying to fill it with a digit from 1 to 9. If a digit can be placed in a cell without violating the Sudoku rules, the algorithm moves to the next cell. If a digit cannot be placed in a cell, the algorithm backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different digit. This process continues until the entire grid is filled.

    The algorithm is a recursive backtracking algorithm. We define a helper function `findCombinations` that takes the following parameters:

1. `startIndex`: the index of the candidates array from which it can start choosing numbers.
2. `remaining`: the remaining sum needed to reach the target.

The base cases are:
- If `remaining` is 0, it means we have found a valid combination, so we return a list containing an empty list.
- If `startIndex` is equal to the length of candidates, or `remaining` is negative, there are no valid combinations, so we return an empty list.

In the function, we first initialize an empty list called `result`. Then, we make two recursive calls to `findCombinations`:

1. Excluding the current candidate at `startIndex` and incrementing `startIndex`, to search for combinations without this candidate.
2. Including the current candidate in the combination, and decreasing `remaining` accordingly (without updating `startIndex`).

After getting results from both recursive calls, we merge them and return the final list of combinations.

The main function `combinationSum` calls `findCombinations` with `startIndex` as 0 and `remaining` as the target, and returns the result after the recursion is done.

   - Exclude the current candidate from the combination and recursively call `find_combinations` with the same `target`, the updated `combination` (do not add the current candidate), and the next index (move to the next candidate).

1. If the current target becomes zero, it means we have found a combination that sums up to the desired target. Add the current combination to the result list and return.
2. Iterate through the `candidates` list starting from the given index.
   - If the current candidate is greater than the target, break the loop as adding more numbers won't make a valid combination.
   - Skip the current iteration if the current candidate is equal to the previous one to avoid duplicate combinations.
   - Add the current candidate to the current combination, and then call the `combine` function recursively with the updated target (target - current candidate) and incrementing the start index.
   - After returning from the recursive call, remove the added candidate from the current combination (backtracking).

    The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach, initializing left and right pointers to the beginning and end of the elevation map, respectively. It also initializes two variables `maxLeft` and `maxRight` to keep track of the maximum heights on the left and right of the pointers, as well as a variable `water` to store the trapped water.

The algorithm iterates through the elevation map until the left pointer is less than the right pointer. In each iteration, it compares the values at both pointers to determine which side is shorter. If the value at the left pointer is less than or equal to the value at the right pointer, it means water can be trapped on the left side up to the height of the shorter bar. The algorithm updates `maxLeft` with the maximum height on the left side and then adds the trapped water (which is the difference between the maximum height and the current height) to the `water` variable. The left pointer is then incremented. If the value at the right pointer is smaller, the same logic is applied to the right side and the right pointer is decremented.

This process is repeated until the left pointer is no longer less than the right pointer, at which point the total trapped water has been calculated and the `water` variable is returned. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) as it only uses constant extra space.

   - Initialize two variables, `max_left` and `max_right`, to keep track of the maximum height to the left and right of the current position.

2. ** Iterate Between Pointers:**

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize a 2D DP Table:**
   - Create a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the first `i` characters of the string `s` match the first `j` characters of the pattern `p`, and `False` otherwise.
   - Initialize `dp[0][0]` to `True` because an empty pattern matches an empty string.

2. ** handled the first row and first column:**
   - For `j > 0`, `dp[0][j]` is `True` if `p[j-1]` is `*` and `dp[0][j-1]` is `True`. This is because `*` can match any sequence, including the empty sequence.
   - For `i > 0`, `dp[i][0]` is `False` because `s[i-1]` cannot match an empty pattern.

3. **Fill the DP Table:**
   - For `i > 0` and `j > 0`, there are three cases to consider:
     - If `p[j-1]` is a letter (not `?` or `*`), `dp[i][j]` is `True` if `dp[i-1][j-1]` is `True` and `s[i-1]` matches `p[j-1]`.
     - If `p[j-1]` is `?`, `dp[i][j]` is `True` if `dp[i-1][j-1]` is `True` because `?` can match any single character.
     - If `p[j-1]` is `*`, `dp[i][j]` is `True` if `dp[i][j-1]` is `True` or if `dp[i-1][j]` is `True`. This is because `*` can match any sequence, including the empty sequence.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - The final answer is `dp[s_length][p_length]`, which indicates whether the entire string `s` matches the entire pattern `p`.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:","python

    We use backtracking to generate permutations. Firstly, we sort the `nums` array to make sure that duplicate numbers are located together. Then, for each recursive backtracking call, we swap the elements in the range `[start, len(nums) - 1]` with `nums[start]`, ignoring already-visited elements by using a `visited` array.

We also skip any element that is equal to the current `start` element to avoid duplicates. After generating a valid permutation by iterating through all indices, we append the current permutation to the result array. When backtracking, we maintain the original order of elements before moving to the next level.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n! * n) since there are n! available permutations and each permutation requires O(n) time to build the solution. The space complexity is O(n) to store the `visited` array and temporary lists.

At the end of the loop, the current product is updated by squaring it. This process continues until all bits of the exponent have been processed.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log(n)) because the loop iterates through the bits of n, and the number of bits in n is proportional to the logarithm of n. The space complexity is O(1), as the space used by the temporary variables does not depend on the size of n.

When placing a queen, check if that position is safe from all previously placed queens in terms of the horizontal, diagonal, and anti-diagonal directions. If the selected position is safe, move on to the next column and try to place another queen there. If no safe positions are found in the current column, then go back to the previous column and move the queen to another safe position.

1. **Initialize an `n x n` chessboard** with all empty spaces represented by ` '.'`.
2. **Define a function `is_safe`** to check if it is safe to place a queen in a given row and column. A queen is safe if there are no other queens in the same row, column, or diagonal.

If it is safe to place a queen, it will mark that cell as occupied by a queen and move to the next row. If it reaches the last row and places a queen in the last row, it has found a solution. If it cannot place a queen in any column of the current row, it will backtrack to the previous row and try to place a queen in a different column of that row.

    The algorithm recursively places queens on columns and checks if the placement is safe, i.e., no queens are attacking each other. 
1. Maintain an array `cols` storing the row indices of placed queens. The index in this array represents the column the queen is placed in. This ensures that no two queens are placed in the same column.
2. Recursively place queens (column-wise).
3. Check for a safe position for each queen in the current column:
   a. Check for same row (`cols[i] == row`).
   b. Check for diagonal attack (`abs(i - col) == abs(cols[i] - row)`).
4. If the current position is safe, place the queen in the current column at the current row position, and continue to place the next queen.
5. If all queens are placed, increment the solution count.
6. If the recursive call finishes, backtrack by removing the queen from the current column and move on to the next row in the same column.
7. The base case is when the `cols` size equals `n`, meaning all queens have been placed safely; increment the count.

This approach considers all possible configurations for placing the n queens while avoiding visiting invalid configurations. It uses backtracking to explore the state space efficiently. The algorithm finds the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, The **n-queens** puzzle is the problem of placing `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. Given an integer `n`, return _the quantity of distinct solutions to the **n-queens puzzle**_. **Example 1:** **Input:** n = 4 **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown. **Example 2:** **Input:** n = 1 **Output:** 1 **Constraints:** * `1 <= n <= 9`","To solve the **n-queens** puzzle and find the number of distinct solutions, we can use a backtracking algorithm. Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, incrementally building candidates to the solutions and abandoning a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be extended to a valid solution.

Here is the step-by-step Python code to solve the problem:

1. **Define the function to check if a queen can be placed at a given position.**
   - The function `is_safe` checks if a queen can be placed at row `row` and column `col` without attacking any other queens already placed on the board.
   - It checks the left vertical, upper left diagonal, and upper right diagonal.

2. **Define the backtracking function to find all solutions.**
   - The function `solve_n_queens` uses recursion to place queens row by row.
   - For each row, it tries to place a queen in each column.
   - If a queen can be placed at a given position, it marks that position as occupied and moves to the next row.
   - If it reaches the last row, it has found a solution and increments the count of solutions.
   - If it cannot place a queen in any column of the current row, it backtracks to the previous row and tries to place the queen in a different column.

3. **Define the main function to solve the n-queens problem.**
   - The function `n_queens` takes an integer `n` as input and calls the `solve_n_queens` function with initial values.
   - It returns the count of distinct solutions.

This helps us to decide whether to continue the current contiguous subarray or start a new one from that element.

1. **Initialize the boundaries**: Define four variables to keep track of the boundaries of the current spiral: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`. Initially, `top` is 0, `bottom` is `m-1`, `left` is 0, and `right` is `n-1`.

2. **Iterate over the matrix**: While `top` is less than or equal to `bottom` and `left` is less than or equal to `right`, perform the following steps:
   - **Move right**: Iterate from `left` to `right` and add the elements to the result list.
   - **Move down**: Iterate from `top` to `bottom` and add the elements to the result list.
   - **Move left**: If `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`, iterate from `right` to `left` and add the elements to the result list.
   - **Move up**: If `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`, iterate from `bottom` to `top` and add the elements to the result list.
   - **Update the boundaries**: After each iteration, update the boundaries by incrementing `top` and `bottom` by 1, and decrementing `left` and `right` by 1.

    The algorithm to merge the new interval starts by exploring the non-overlapping intervals before the new one as we are given a sorted list of intervals. We add the explored intervals that came before to the result. After that, we continue exploring intervals that overlap with the new interval and continuously merging them. We update the new interval's starting and ending points according to the merging process until no overlapping intervals remain. We add the merged interval to the result list, and finally, we add the rest of the original intervals present after the new interval. The result will be a merged list of intervals. 
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the `ith` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

2. **Check for overlaps**: We need to check if the new interval overlaps with any of the existing intervals. If it does, we need to merge the new interval with the overlapping intervals.

    ","Considering the aforementioned details, You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid`. There is a robot initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. An obstacle and space are marked as `1` or `0` respectively in `grid`. A path that the robot takes cannot include **any** square that is an obstacle. Return _the quantity of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

1. Initialize `dp[0][0]` to 1 because there is exactly one way to be at the starting point.
2. For each cell `(i, j)`, if it is an obstacle (i.e., `obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1`), then `dp[i][j]` is 0 because the robot cannot pass through this cell.
3. If the cell is not an obstacle, then `dp[i][j]` is the sum of the number of ways to reach the cell above it (`dp[i-1][j]`) and the number of ways to reach the cell to the left of it (`dp[i][j-1]`).

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

    The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize an empty result list.
2. Use `idx` to keep track of the start of the line. `idx` initially starts at 0, i.e., the first word.
3. Calculate the total number of characters from `idx` to the last word in a line by testing whether adding the next word, with an extra space before it, would exceed `maxWidth`.
4. Find the number of gaps in the current line. If it is the last line or there is only one word, left-justify the words and pad the remaining space with spaces.
5. If it's not the last line, distribute spaces as evenly as possible between words: calculate `evenSpaces` and `extraSpaces`, and add an extra space to the left gaps until there are no more `extraSpaces`.
6. Append the constructed line to the result list and update the `idx` to the start of the next line.
7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 until reaching the last word.
8. Return the result list.
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified. You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters. Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the quantity of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right. For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words. **Note:** * A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only. * Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than `0` and not exceed `maxWidth`. * The input array `words` contains at least one word. **Example 1:** **Input:** words = \[ ""This "", ""is "", ""an "", ""example "", ""of "", ""text "", ""justification. ""\], maxWidth = 16 **Output:** \[ ""This is an "", ""example of text "", ""justification. "" \] **Example 2:** **Input:** words = \[ ""What "", ""must "", ""be "", ""acknowledgment "", ""shall "", ""be ""\], maxWidth = 16 **Output:** \[ ""What must be "", ""acknowledgment "", ""shall be "" \] **Explanation:** Note that the last line is ""shall be "" instead of ""shall be "", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified. Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word. **Example 3:** **Input:** words = \[ ""Science "", ""is "", ""what "", ""we "", ""understand "", ""well "", ""enough "", ""to "", ""explain "", ""to "", ""a "", ""computer. "", ""Art "", ""is "", ""everything "", ""else "", ""we "", ""do ""\], maxWidth = 20 **Output:** \[ ""Science is what we "", ""understand well "", ""enough to explain to "", ""a computer. Art is "", ""everything else we "", ""do "" \] **Constraints:** * `1 <= words.length <= 300` * `1 <= words[i].length <= 20` * `words[i]` consists of only English letters and symbols. * `1 <= maxWidth <= 100` * `words[i].length <= maxWidth`","To solve the problem of formatting text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified, we can follow these steps:

1. **Iterate through the words and pack them into lines:**
   - Start with an empty list to hold the lines.
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the current line's length.
   - Iterate through each word in the `words` array.
   - If adding the current word to the line would exceed `maxWidth`, add the current line to the list of lines, reset the line length to the length of the current word, and move to the next line.
   - If adding the current word does not exceed `maxWidth`, add the word to the current line and update the line length.

2. ** justifies the last line:**
   - After all words have been packed into lines, the last line may not be fully filled.
   - Calculate the number of extra spaces needed to fill the last line.
   - Distribute these extra spaces evenly among the words in the last line, with extra spaces on the left if necessary.

3. ** format each line:**
   - For each line, calculate the number of extra spaces needed between words.
   - Add the words to the line with the appropriate number of extra spaces between them.

In each iteration, we update `a` and `b` with the new number of ways to reach steps `n-2` and `n-1` respectively, and keep calculating the number of ways to reach step `n` using `a + b`.

Firstly, the number of rows and columns (m and n) are computed. Then, we initialize the left and right pointers (l and r).

In each step of the binary search, we calculate the middle index (mid) and get the corresponding value (mid_val) in the matrix. To get the value in the matrix, we divide mid by n and take the remainder.

We then compare the mid_val with the target. If it is equal to the target, we return true. If it's less than the target, we move the left pointer to the next position (mid + 1). Otherwise, we move the right pointer (mid - 1).

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Determine the range of the matrix**: The first element of the matrix is `matrix[0][0]` and the last element of the matrix is `matrix[m-1][n-1]`. If `target` is within this range, it might be in the matrix. Otherwise, it is not.

2. **Binary search for the row**: Perform a binary search on the rows of the matrix to find the row that could contain the target. This is done by comparing the target with the last element of each row. If the target is less than or equal to the last element of a row, then the target could be in that row. Otherwise, it is in a row above it.

3. **Binary search for the element within the row**: Once we have identified the row that could contain the target, perform a binary search within that row to find the target. If the target is found, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

    The algorithm can be explained using three pointers: `red`, `white`, and `blue`. `red` is responsible for tracking the position where the next 0 should be moved to, starting from the beginning of the array. Likewise, `blue` is responsible for tracking the position where the next 2 should be swapped to, starting from the end of the array. `white` is responsible for iterating through the array.

While `white` is less than or equal to `blue`, check the current `nums[white]` value. If it is 0, swap it with the value at index `red`, and increment both `red` and `white`. If it is 1, simply increment `white`. If it is 2, swap the value at index `white` with the value at index `blue`, and decrement `blue` without incrementing `white` since the newly swapped value at index `white` might be 0 or 2.

This will sort the colors in the required order with a linear-time complexity, as we only go through the array once with the `white` pointer. Also, it sorts the colors in-place without the need for additional storage.

This approach ensures that we only use constant extra space and make a single pass through the array.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the Python code to implement this solution:

1. Initialize three pointers: `left` to keep track of the position where the next red element (0) should be placed, `mid` to keep track of the current element being considered, and `right` to keep track of the position where the next blue element (2) should be placed.
2. Iterate through the array with the `mid` pointer.
3. If the element at `mid` is `0`, swap it with the element at `left` and increment both `left` and `mid`.
4. If the element at `mid` is `2`, swap it with the element at `right` and decrement `right`.
5. If the element at `mid` is `1`, do nothing and just increment `mid`.

3. Iterate through the string `s` using the `right` pointer, and:
    - If the current character exists in the `need` map, update the count of the character in the `window` map, and increment `valid` if the count in the window is less than or equal to the count in need.
4. Check the validity by comparing `valid` with the length of `t`.
    - If valid, update the answer substring's `start` and `length` if the current window's length is less than the current minimum.
    - Then, increment the `left` pointer to slide the window until the current character count in the window goes below the count in `need`. Update the `valid` counter accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Create a dictionary `t_count` to store the frequency of each character in `t`.
   - Create a dictionary `s_count` to store the frequency of each character in the current window of `s`.
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the window.
   - Initialize variables `min_length` and `min_start` to store the length of the minimum window and its starting index, respectively.

2. **Expand the Window:**
   - Iterate over the characters in `s` using the `right` pointer.
   - Update the frequency of the current character in `s_count`.
   - If the frequency of the current character in `s_count` is equal to its frequency in `t_count`, it means the character is included in the window.

3. ** Shrink the Window:**
   - While the window contains all characters of `t`, move the `left` pointer to the right.
   - Update the frequency of the current character in `s_count`.
   - If the frequency of the current character in `s_count` is less than its frequency in `t_count`, it means the character is no longer included in the window.
   - Calculate the length of the current window and update `min_length` and `min_start` if the current window is smaller.

4. **Return the Minimum Window:**
   - If `min_length` is still its initial value, it means no valid window was found, so return an empty string.
   - Otherwise, return the substring of `s` from `min_start` to `min_start + min_length`.

    The algorithm uses a backtracking approach to generate all possible combinations of k numbers out of the range [1, n]. We create a helper function called `backtrack` that recursively generates combinations. In this helper function, we have a base case where if the size of the current combination is equal to k, we add it to the result. Otherwise, we iterate through the numbers from the start index to n, add the current number to the current combination, and make a recursive call with an incremented start index. After the call, we ""undo"" the decision by removing the number from the current combination (backtracking).

The main function initializes an empty result list, calls the `backtrack` function with a start index of 1 and an empty current combination list, and then returns the result list.

If it is the same, we do not add it to the array (we keep the previous unique element). If it is different, we add it to the array and increment `j`.

4. **Move to Next Unique Element**: If the element at position `i` is different from the element at position `j-1`, we add it to the array and increment `j`.

Inside the loop, we first calculate the middle index `mid` using the `left` and `right` pointers. If the middle element of the array is equal to the target, we return true, indicating that the target is found.

If the middle element is equal to the left element, we increment the `left` pointer. If the middle element is greater than the left element, we check if the target is within the left and middle elements. If it is, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one. Otherwise, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one.

If the middle element is still smaller than the left element, we then check if the target is within the middle and right elements. If it is, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one. Otherwise, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one.

The key is to handle the rotation and duplicates in a way that allows us to efficiently determine if the target is in the array.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the rotation point**: The rotation point is the index where the array is divided into two parts. The left part is in non-decreasing order, and the right part is also in non-decreasing order, but the right part is rotated to the beginning of the array.

2. **Perform binary search**: We can use binary search to find the rotation point. The rotation point is the index where the next element is smaller than the current element.

3. **Check if the target is in the left or right part**: Once we have the rotation point, we can determine if the target is in the left part or the right part of the array. If the target is in the left part, we search in the left part. If the target is in the right part, we search in the right part.

4. **Handle duplicates**: When handling duplicates, we need to ensure that we don't get stuck in an infinite loop. We can do this by checking if the current element is equal to the target. If it is, we return true. If the current element is greater than the target, we move the left boundary to the left. If the current element is less than the target, we move the right boundary to the right.

    The algorithm uses a dummy node to simplify the handling of the head node of the linked list. We declare two pointers: `prev` and `curr` which are pointers to the previous and current nodes, respectively. 

The algorithm iterates through the list with the current pointer. If the current node's value is equal to the next node's value, we continue moving the current pointer along the duplicate values. Once we reach the end of duplicates, we check if the previous node's next pointer is pointing to the current node. If it is, it means there were no duplicates (prev and curr are consecutive), so we move the `prev` pointer to the current node. Otherwise, we set `prev.next` to `curr.next` to skip the duplicates. 

Finally, we move the current pointer to the next node, and repeat the process. The resulting list will have all duplicates removed, and the changes will persist as the dummy node is used to reference the head of the modified list.

    The algorithm to delete all duplicates in a sorted linked list simply iterates through the list and compares the value of the current node with the value of the next. If both values are the same, it means that there is a duplicate, so the current node's ""next"" pointer is updated to point to the node after the duplicate. If the values are different, the algorithm continues iterating to the next node. The process continues until reaching the end of the list.

    The algorithm works by recursively dividing the strings into smaller substrings and checking if the substrings from s1 can be rearranged into the corresponding substrings of s2. The base case is when both strings (s1, and s2) are equal. If the lengths of the strings are different or the characters are different, then the function returns false. Then, we iterate through the length of strings, dividing the strings into smaller substrings and checking if these substrings can be rearranged to form the scrambled string. We check for both possible arrangements of the substrings, i.e., same order and reverse order, invoking the same function recursively for each combination.
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm: 1. If the length of the string is 1, stop. 2. If the length of the string is > 1, do the following: * Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is `s`, divide it to `x` and `y` where `s = x + y`. * **Randomly** decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, `s` may become `s = x + y` or `s = y + x`. * Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings `x` and `y`. Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of **the same length**, return `true` if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, otherwise, return `false`. **Example 1:** **Input:** s1 = ""great "", s2 = ""rgeat "" **Output:** true **Explanation:** One possible scenario applied on s1 is: ""great "" --> ""gr/eat "" // divide at random index. ""gr/eat "" --> ""gr/eat "" // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order. ""gr/eat "" --> ""g/r / e/at "" // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them. ""g/r / e/at "" --> ""r/g / e/at "" // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order. ""r/g / e/at "" --> ""r/g / e/ a/t "" // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide ""at "" to ""a/t "". ""r/g / e/ a/t "" --> ""r/g / e/ a/t "" // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order. The algorithm stops now, and the result string is ""rgeat "" which is s2. As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true. **Example 2:** **Input:** s1 = ""abcde "", s2 = ""caebd "" **Output:** false **Example 3:** **Input:** s1 = ""a "", s2 = ""a "" **Output:** true **Constraints:** * `s1.length == s2.length` * `1 <= s1.length <= 30` * `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters.","To determine if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, we can use a recursive approach. The key idea is to check if `s2` can be obtained from `s1` by repeatedly applying the given algorithm. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Base Case**: If the length of `s1` is 1, then `s1` and `s2` must be the same string. This is because there is only one way to split a string of length 1 into two non-empty substrings, and there is only one way to order them (since they are both empty).

2. **Recursive Case**: If the length of `s1` is greater than 1, we need to consider all possible ways to split `s1` into two non-empty substrings `x` and `y` and check if `s2` can be obtained by either swapping `x` and `y` or keeping them in the same order. We do this by recursively checking if the scrambled string of `x` is equal to the first part of `s2` and the scrambled string of `y` is equal to the second part of `s2` (or vice versa).

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:","python

    # Recursive case: split s1 into all possible non-empty substrings

        x = s1[:i]
        y = s1[i:]

1. **Define the recursive function**: We'll define a function `find_subsets` that takes the current index in the array, the current subset, and the result list of subsets as parameters. This function will explore all possible subsets by including or excluding the current element at the given index.

2. **Base case**: If the current index is equal to the length of the array, we add the current subset to the result list and return.

3. **Recursive case**: For each element at the current index, we have two choices:
   - Include the element in the current subset and recursively call `find_subsets` with the next index.
   - Exclude the element from the current subset and recursively call `find_subsets` with the next index.

4. **Avoiding duplicates**: To avoid duplicate subsets, we need to ensure that we do not include the same element more than once in the same subset. We can do this by checking if the current element is the same as the element at the previous index and only including it if it is not.

The base cases are:
- `dp[0] = 1` because there is exactly one way to decode an empty string (do nothing).
- `dp[1] = 1` if `s[0]` is not '0', because there is exactly one way to decode a single digit (itself).

For `i` from 2 to `n` (where `n` is the length of the string), we can update `dp[i]` based on the following two cases:
1. The last digit `s[i-1]` can be decode on its own if it is between 1 and 9. In this case, the number of ways to decode the first `i` characters is the same as the number of ways to decode the first `i-1` characters, i.e., `dp[i-1]`.
2. The last two digits `s[i-2]` and `s[i-1]` can be decode together if they form a number between 10 and 26. In this case, the number of ways to decode the first `i` characters is the same as the number of ways to decode the first `i-2` characters, i.e., `dp[i-2]`.

The final answer is `dp[n]`.

Let's implement this in Python:","python
def num解 coding(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    dp[1] = 1 if s[0]!= '0' else 0
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # Case 1: Last digit can be decode on its own
        if s[i-1] >= '1' and s[i-1] <= '9':
            dp[i] += dp[i-1]
        
        # Case 2: Last two digits can be decode together
        if s[i-2] == '1' and s[i-1] >= '0' and s[i-1] <= '9':
            dp[i] += dp[i-2]
        elif s[i-2] == '2' and s[i-1] >= '0' and s[i-1] <= '6':

The algorithm iterates through the string s, starting at the current index. It keeps track of the current number (0-255) being constructed by multiplying the current number by 10 and adding the current digit. If the current number is greater than 255, we break the iteration.

We then call the dfs function recursively, with the current index incremented by one, the current IP appended with the current character and a dot, and incrementing part by 1. If the current number is 0 (which indicates a leading zero), we also break the iteration.

96,96,96,96,96,96,qwen_2_5_7b,Medium,"Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an **interleaving** of `s1` and `s2`.

An **interleaving** of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where `s` and `t` are divided into `n` and `m` substrings respectively, such that:

*   `s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
*   `t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
*   `|n - m| <= 1`
*   The **interleaving** is `s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ...` or `t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...`

**Note:** `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  ""aabcc "", s2 =  ""dbbca "", s3 =  ""aadbbcbcac ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 =  ""aa "" +  ""bc "" +  ""c "", and s2 into s2 =  ""dbbc "" +  ""a "".
Interleaving the two splits, we get  ""aa "" +  ""dbbc "" +  ""bc "" +  ""a "" +  ""c "" =  ""aadbbcbcac "".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  ""aabcc "", s2 =  ""dbbca "", s3 =  ""aadbbbaccc ""
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  "" "", s2 =  "" "", s3 =  "" ""

    We use a dynamic programming approach (2D DP) to solve this problem. The algorithm checks whether the s3[position] is equal to s1 or s2 in the same dp[position]. If so, we take the value of the previous dp[i-1] or dp[j-1] accordingly if the characters match. For the base case, we start with initializing dp[0][0] to true since two empty strings can form an empty s3.

At the end of the iterations, the last element in the dp matrix (i.e. dp[m][n]) will represent whether s3 can be formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.

We will iterate through `s3` and check if we can find a way to split `s3` into two parts such that the parts correspond to `s1` and `s2` in an interleaved manner.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Check the lengths of the strings:**
   - If the absolute difference between the lengths of `s1` and `s2` is greater than 1, then `s3` cannot be an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.
   - If the length of `s3` is not equal to the sum of the lengths of `s1` and `s2`, then `s3` cannot be an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.

2. **Initialize two pointers:**
   - One pointer `i` for `s1`.
   - One pointer `j` for `s2`.
   - Both pointers start at 0.

3. **Iterate through `s3`:**
   - For each character in `s3`, check if it matches the current character in `s1` or `s2`.
   - If it matches `s1[i]`, increment `i`.
   - If it matches `s2[j]`, increment `j`.
   - If it does not match either `s1[i]` or `s2[j]`, return false.

4. **Check the positions of the pointers:**
   - After iterating through `s3`, if `i` is equal to the length of `s1` and `j` is equal to the length of `s2`, then `s3` is an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.
   - If `i` is equal to the length of `s1` and `j` is not equal to the length of `s2`, or if `i` is not equal to the length of `s1` and `j` is equal to the length of `s2`, then `s3` is not an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.

    The algorithm follows a simple recursive approach to determine if a given binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST). The key idea is to maintain a range for each node, which is defined by the minimum and maximum values that the node's value should be within. For example, the root node's value should be in the range of (-Infinity, Infinity). When traversing to the left child, the maximum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value, and for traversing to the right child, the minimum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value. The algorithm continues recursively in this manner.

A helper function, `isValidBSTHelper`, is defined and initialized with the root and the range (-Infinity, Infinity). If the node is `null`, it means that we have reached a leaf node and it should return `true`. If the value of the node is not within the specified range, it means that the node does not meet the BST requirement and the helper function should return `false`. If the node is valid, then the helper function proceeds to check for valid BSTs in its left and right subtrees with the updated range.

1. Traverse the BST using Inorder traversal, and at each node, compare its value with the previous node.
2. If the previous node's value is greater than the current node's value, it means they are swapped. So, mark the first such node as `first` and the second such node as `second`.

    The algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) on both the preorder and inorder traversal results. This algorithm iteratively breaks the inorder sequence into left and right subtrees using the preorder array. The basic idea is that the first element of preorder traversal will always be the root of the tree. Then, we can find that root node's index in the inorder traversal, and create the left subtree from the elements to the left of the index, and the right subtree from the elements to the right of the index. Then we continue this process recursively.

To improve the performance of the search for the index, we can use a map (in C++, Java and JavaScript) or a dictionary (in Python) to store the indices of all elements in the inorder traversal. This way, we don't need to traverse the inorder array every time to find the index of the current element.

Since we're doing this for Python, Java, C++ and JavaScript, some data structures might look a bit different and have different functions to do the same action, but the algorithm used in all languages is the same.

- Preorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- Inorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- A map is used to store the indices for inorder traversal in C++, Java, and JavaScript, while a dictionary is used in Python.
- A helper function is used to recursively construct the tree.
- For Python and JavaScript, the scope of pre_idx is made non-local, so it does not require additional arguments.

The resulting functions return the root node of the reconstructed binary tree.

    We are given the inorder and postorder traversals of a binary tree, and the task is to reconstruct the binary tree from this information. In the postorder traversal, the last element is the root of the tree. Knowing the root, we can divide the inorder traversal into left and right subtrees. With the knowledge of the left subtree size, we can divide the postorder traversal into left and right subtrees as well. We can then recursively build the left and right subtrees, and construct the tree accordingly.

The provided solution maintains a hashmap to keep the indexes of elements in the inorder traversal for easy access during the construction. It uses a helper function `_build` to carry out the recursive construction. The `_build` function takes in the range of elements to be considered in both inorder and postorder traversals and recursively constructs the tree, by dividing the inorder and postorder ranges into left and right subtrees, using the root found in the postorder traversal.

    The algorithm for bottom-up level order traversal of a binary tree works as follows:

1. Create an empty result list.
2. If the root is NULL, return the empty result list.
3. Create a queue and push the root onto the queue.
4. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Create a new list to store the current level's nodes values.
   b. Store the current queue size as the level size.
   c. Iterate through the number of nodes in the level (using the level size).
        i. Pop the front node (or dequeue) from the queue and add its value to the level list.
       ii. If the popped node has a left child, push it onto the queue.
      iii. If the popped node has a right child, push it onto the queue.
   d. Insert the level list at the beginning of the result list (to achieve bottom-up order).
5. Return the result list.
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values_. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root). **Example 1:** **Input:** root = \[3,9,20,null,null,15,7\] **Output:** \[\[15,7\],\[9,20\],\[3\]\] **Example 2:** **Input:** root = \[1\] **Output:** \[\[1\]\] **Example 3:** **Input:** root = \[\] **Output:** \[\] **Constraints:** * The quantity of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`. * `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`","To solve the problem of finding the bottom-up level order traversal of a binary tree, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. The key is to use a queue to keep track of the nodes at each level. We start by adding the root node to the queue. Then, we repeatedly DEqueue a node, add its value to our result, and enqueue its children (if they exist). We continue this process until the queue is empty. However, since we want the bottom-up order, we need to reverse the order of the levels in the result.

2. For each half of the array (elements to the left of the middle element and elements to the right of the middle element), repeat step 1 recursively.

    The algorithm is based on the depth-first search. In this algorithm, we define a helper function named `getHeight` which will return the height of the given subtree if it is balanced, otherwise, it will return -1.

The `getHeight` function works as follows:
1. If the current node is null, return 0 (base case).
2. Call the function recursively for the left subtree (leftHeight) and the right subtree (rightHeight).
3. If either of the subtrees is not balanced or the height difference is greater than 1, return -1.
4. Otherwise, return the maximum height of the left and right subtrees incremented by 1.

The main function `isBalanced` just calls the `getHeight` function and checks whether its result is -1 or not. If it is not -1, the binary tree is height-balanced, otherwise, it is not balanced.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. **Define a function to calculate the height of a binary tree.**
   - If the root is `None`, the height is 0.
   - Otherwise, the height is 1 plus the maximum height of the left and right subtrees.

2. **Define a function to check if a binary tree is height-balanced.**
   - If the root is `None`, the tree is empty and thus height-balanced.
   - Otherwise, calculate the height of the left and right subtrees.
   - If the absolute difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees is greater than 1, the tree is not height-balanced.

1. **Define the Problem**: We need to find all paths from the root to the leaves where the sum of the node values equals the target sum. Each path should be returned as a list of node values.

2. **Recursive Function**: We will use a recursive function to perform the DFS. The function will take the current node, the current path, and the current sum as parameters. It will explore all paths from the current node to its children.

3. **Base Case**: If the current node is a leaf (i.e., it has no children), we check if the current sum equals the target sum. If it does, we add the current path to the result list.

4. **Recursive Case**: If the current node is not a leaf, we recursively call the function for each child of the current node, updating the current path and the current sum.

5. **Initialize the Result**: We start the DFS from the root of the tree with an empty path and a current sum of 0.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize a queue**: Start by adding the root node to a queue. This queue will be used to perform the BFS.

2. **BFS loop**: While the queue is not empty, perform the following steps:
   - Get the number of nodes at the current level by getting the size of the queue.
   - For each node at the current level, do the following:
     - Set the next pointer of the current node to the next node in the queue.

   - After processing all nodes at the current level, add a null node to the queue to indicate the end of the current level.

    The algorithm iterates through each row of Pascal's Triangle, from 0 to numRows-1, and generates the corresponding row with the required values based on the row index. For each row, it initializes an array or list, and then sets the first element to 1 (since all rows start with 1).

Next, we iterate from the second element to the (i-1)-th element of the row (i being the row index). Each element (at index j) of the row is set to the sum of the two values positioned just above it in the previous row - these values are available at (i-1, j-1) and (i-1, j) in Pascal's Triangle.

If the current row is not the first row, we add another 1 at the end of the row, since all rows end with 1 (except the very first row).

Finally, we append the row to the resulting Pascal's Triangle structure (list of lists or vector of vectors). After completing the loop, the algorithm returns the Pascal's Triangle structure containing numRows.

We will keep track of the maximum profit we can achieve after each day, considering the constraints of not being able to engage in multiple transactions simultaneously.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit we can achieve after `i` days with `j` transactions.
   - We need to consider three states: `dp[i][0]` (no transactions), `dp[i][1]` (one transaction), and `dp[i][2]` (two transactions).

2. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[0][0] = 0` (no transactions on the first day).
   - `dp[0][1] = 0` (one transaction on the first day).
   - `dp[0][2] = 0` (two transactions on the first day).

3. **Transition Rules:**
   - For `dp[i][0]` (no transactions):
     \[
     dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]
     \]
     We do not perform any transaction on day `i`.

   - For `dp[i][1]` (one transaction):
     \[
     dp[i][1] = \max(dp[i-1][1], prices[i] - dp[i-1][0])
     \]
     We either do not perform a transaction on day `i` or we perform a transaction on day `i` and buy the stock at the minimum price seen so far.

   - For `dp[i][2]` (two transactions):
     \[
     dp[i][2] = \max(dp[i-1][2], prices[i] + dp[i-1][1])
     \]
     We either do not perform a transaction on day `i` or we perform a transaction on day `i` and sell the stock at the maximum profit seen so far.

4. **Iterate Through Days:**
   - Update `dp[i][0]`, `dp[i][1]`, and `dp[i][2]` for each day `i` from 1 to `n`.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The maximum profit after `n` days with at most two transactions is `dp[n][2]`.

1. **Define a recursive function** that takes a node as input and returns the maximum path sum that can be formed using that node.
2. **Base Case**: If the node is `None`, return 0.
3. **Recursive Case**:
   - Calculate the maximum path sum that can be formed using the left child.
   - Calculate the maximum path sum that can be formed using the right child.
   - The maximum path sum that includes the current node is the sum of the node's value and the maximum of the path sums of its left and right children. However, we need to consider the case where the path does not include the current node's children if their path sums are negative.
   - Therefore, we return the maximum of:
     - The sum of the node's value and the maximum of the path sums of its left and right children.
     - The maximum path sum of its left child.
     - The maximum path sum of its right child.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the queue and the visited set:**

   - Create a set and add the `begin word` to it.
   - Initialize a variable `distance` to 1.

     - If the word is the `end word`, return the distance.
     - Otherwise, generate all possible transformations of the word by changing one letter at a time.
     - For each transformation, if it is in the `wordList` and has not been visited, add it to the queue and the visited set, and update the distance to `distance + 1`.

3. **Return the result:**
   - If the `end word` is not found, return 0.

    The algorithm first creates a set (or hash set) with the given array of integers called `elements`. The set will allow us to have a fast O(1) lookup on our next step.
Now we iterate through the original array of numbers, and for each number, we check if `(number - 1)` is not in the `elements` set. If it's not in the set, it means we can start counting a new consecutive sequence.
Next, we create two variables, `currentNum` and `currentSeq`, and initialize them with the current number and 1, respectively.
We then use a while loop to check if the next number (`currentNum + 1`) is in the `elements` set. If it is, we increment both `currentNum` and `currentSeq`. This process will continue, finding consecutive elements in the set, until no more consecutive elements are found.
Finally, to get the length of the longest consecutive sequence, we update the `longestSeq` variable by choosing the maximum value between itself and `currentSeq`. This will keep track of the longest consecutive sequence found so far.
The process continues until all numbers in the original array have been checked, and at the end, `longestSeq` will store the answer - the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List neighbors;
}

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\]\]
**Output:** \[\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\]\]
**Explanation:** There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\[\]\]
**Output:** \[\[\]\]
**Explanation:** Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   `Node.val` is unique for each node.
*   There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
*   The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.","

1. Create a `visited` dictionary (C++: `unordered_map`, Java: `HashMap`, Python: `dict`, JavaScript: `Map`) to track visited nodes and keep their clones.
2. Define a recursive helper function `cloneGraph` that takes a node and the visited dictionary as input.
3. If the input node is `null`, return `null`.
4. If the input node is already in the visited dictionary, return its clone.
5. Otherwise, create a new clone node with the same value as the input node, and add it to the visited dictionary.
6. Iterate through the neighbors of the input node, and call the `cloneGraph` helper function recursively for each neighbor, adding the returned clones to the clone node's neighbors.
7. Return the clone node.

Finally, call the `cloneGraph` helper function with the given node and the initially empty visited dictionary.

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to create a new graph that is a complete copy of the original graph, including all nodes and their edges. Each node in the new graph should have the same value and the same neighbors as the corresponding node in the original graph.

2. **Define the Class**: We are given the adjacency list of the graph, where each node is represented by an integer from 1 to the total number of nodes. We need to create a new adjacency list for the cloned graph.

3. **Create a Mapping**: We will use a dictionary to map each node in the original graph to its corresponding node in the cloned graph. This mapping will help us to ensure that each node in the new graph has the same value and the same neighbors as the corresponding node in the original graph.

4. **克隆 the Graph**: Iterate through each node in the original graph and create a new node in the cloned graph with the same value. Then, add the neighbors of the original node to the neighbors of the corresponding node in the cloned graph.

5. **Return the Cloned Graph**: Finally, return the adjacency list of the cloned graph.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith` station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return _the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return_ `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**

**Input:** gas = \[1,2,3,4,5\], cost = \[3,4,5,1,2\]

**Explanation:**
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4

Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** gas = \[2,3,4\], cost = \[3,4,3\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.

```
    
    The algorithm maintains four variables: `total_gas`, `total_cost`, `start`, and `gas_tank`. We initialize these variables to 0. We then loop through each gas station and perform the following steps:

1. Add the gas at the current station to `total_gas`.
2. Add the cost of traveling from this station to the next one to `total_cost`.
3. Add the net gain/loss of gas (gas[i] - cost[i]) to `gas_tank`.
4. If the `gas_tank` is negative, update the `start` position to the next station and reset the `gas_tank` to 0.

After looping through all the gas stations, we check if `total_gas` is greater than or equal to `total_cost`. If it is, we return the `start` position, as this is the first gas station from which we can make a complete trip. If not, we return -1, because it is not possible to complete the circuit. 

This algorithm guarantees a unique solution because if there are multiple valid starting points, there must be a gas station with a lower cost to travel from it to the next station for each solution. As a result, the one with the lowest starting cost would always be chosen, ensuring uniqueness.

We can use a greedy algorithm to achieve this.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the net gas available at each station:**
   For each station \( i \), the net gas available is \( gas[i] - cost[i] \). This represents the amount of gas left after traveling from station \( i \) to station \( i+1 \).

2. **Find the starting station:**
   We need to find a starting station \( start \) such that the cumulative net gas from \( start \) to \( start \) (after completing the circle) is non-negative. We can do this by iterating through each station and keeping track of the cumulative net gas. If at any point the cumulative net gas becomes negative, we start over from the next station.

3. **Check if a solution exists:**
   If we can find a starting station such that the cumulative net gas is non-negative after completing the circle, then a solution exists. Otherwise, no solution exists.

Let's implement this in Python:","python

    In this problem, we use two variables, ones and twos, to represent the number of occurrences of each bit in the array's elements.

Initially, both ones and twos are set to 0. We use XOR (^) to count the occurrences of each bit in the array. The reason we use XOR is that it cancels out the same bits, so if a bit occurs twice, it will be 0.

We then loop through each element of the array and use XOR to count the bit occurrences. If a bit occurs for the first time, it's XORed into ones; if it occurs for the second time, it's XORed into twos. If it appears for the third time, it should be removed from both ones and twos. To achieve this, we use the bitwise AND (&) along with the bitwise NOT (~) to clear the bits that appear in twos from ones and vice versa.

Finally, after looping through all the elements of the array, the variable ones will only contain the bits that occurred once in the array, and that is our result. So we return the ones variable.

Therefore, if we XOR all the elements in the array, the elements that appear three times will cancel each other out, leaving us with the single element that appears once.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize a variable `result` to 0.
2. Iterate through each element in the array and XOR it with `result`.
3. After iterating through all elements, `result` will hold the single element that appears once.

    The algorithm follows these steps:

1. Iterate through the original linked list, creating new nodes with the same value as the original nodes and insert them right after the original node in the original list. Now we have an interleaved list where each original node is followed by its copy.
2. Iterate through the interleaved list and assign the `random` pointers of the new nodes. Since the new nodes are right after their corresponding originals, we can easily set the `random` pointers for the new nodes based on the `random` pointers of the original nodes.
3. Separate the interleaved list into two separate lists - the original list and the copied list.

This algorithm creates a deep copy of the linked list with random pointers without using any extra space or data structures other than the nodes themselves. The running time complexity is O(n) as we do three separate O(n) passes through the linked list.

For each substring, we check if it exists in the dictionary. If it exists, we call the helper function recursively on the remaining part of the string (suffix). This will give us all the possible combinations for the suffix. Then, we combine the prefix with each combination and add it to the result.

Memoization is used to store the results of the helper function for each substring encountered, so that we don't need to compute it multiple times. This speeds up the algorithm by reducing repeated computations.

Finally, we return the list of combinations where all the words are found in the dictionary.

In each iteration, we pop a node from the stack, and insert its value at the beginning of the result list (to ensure the correct order for the postorder traversal), then, push its left child, and then its right child to the stack (if they are not null). In the end, we return the result list. The algorithm is non-recursive which makes it easier to understand for some.

The list will be used to determine the least recently used key. When the cache is full and a new key is added, we will remove the least recently used key from the list.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

   - Create an empty dictionary ` self.cache` to store the key-value pairs.
   - Create an empty list ` self order` to keep track of the order of the keys.
   - Set the ` self_capacity` to the given capacity.

2. **Add a key-value pair to the cache:**
   - If the key already exists in the cache, update its value and move it to the front of the list.
   - If the key does not exist, add it to the front of the list and store its value in the dictionary.

    The insertion sort algorithm for a linked list involves iterating through the list, removing one element at a time, and inserting it into the sorted sublist. We use a dummy node to act as the head of the sorted sublist, which initially has no elements. In each iteration, we compare the current element (its value) to the elements in the sorted sublist, and insert it into its proper position. This is done by updating the ""next"" pointers for the appropriate nodes. The process is repeated until all elements from the original list have been processed and added to the sorted sublist. At the end, the sorted sublist is returned, starting from the next node after the dummy head node.

    The algorithm to reverse the order of the words is as follows:

1. First, split the input string using spaces. In C++, we use `stringstream` and a while loop to read words, while in Java and JavaScript, we use `split` with regex to split the string based on one or more spaces. In Python, we can simply use `split()` since it splits on whitespace by default and ignores leading and trailing spaces.

2. Reverse the array of words. In C++, we use the `reverse` function from the `algorithm` library. In Java, we can use `Collections.reverse()` method. In Python, we use list `reverse()` method. In JavaScript, we use the `reverse()` method on the array.

3. Join the reversed array of words into a single string with a space delimiter. In C++, we concatenate words with a space but avoid adding an extra space at the end. In Java, we use `String.join()`, in Python, use `join()` on the delimiter string, and in JavaScript, use `join()` on the array.

3. **Remove multiple spaces between words**: This step is necessary to ensure that there is only one space between each pair of words in the final output.

You must implement a solution with `O(1)` time complexity for each function. **Example 1:** **Input** \[ ""MinStack "", ""push "", ""push "", ""push "", ""getMin "", ""pop "", ""top "", ""getMin ""\] \[\[\],\[-2\],\[0\],\[-3\],\[\],\[\],\[\],\[\]\] **Output** \[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2\] **Explanation** MinStack minStack = new MinStack(); minStack.push(-2); minStack.push(0); minStack.push(-3); minStack.getMin(); // return -3 minStack.pop(); minStack.top(); // return 0 minStack.getMin(); // return -2 **Constraints:** * `-231 <= val <= 231 - 1` * Methods `pop`, `top` and `getMin` operations will always be called on **non-empty** stacks. * At most `3 * 104` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `getMin`.","To solve the problem of implementing a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time, we can use two stacks: one to store the elements and another to store the minimum values up to the current top of the stack. Here's how we can do it:

1. ** Initialize two stacks:**
   - `stack`: to store the elements.
   - `min_stack`: to store the minimum values up to the current top of the `stack`.

2. **推入元素:**
   - When we push an element `val` onto the `stack`, we also need to update the `min_stack`.
   - If `min_stack` is empty or `val` is less than or equal to the top of `min_stack`, we push `val` onto `min_stack`.
   - Otherwise, we push the top of `min_stack` onto `min_stack`.

3. **弹出元素:**
   - When we pop an element from the `stack`, we also need to remove it from the `min_stack`.

4. **获取顶部元素:**
   - When we top the `stack`, we return the top of the `stack`.

5. **获取最小元素:**
   - When we get the minimum element from the `stack`, we return the top of the `min_stack`.

Then, the algorithm calls itself recursively, passing the left child of the current root as the new argument, until it reaches the last node in the leftmost branch. This last node becomes the new root.

At each level of recursion, the algorithm updates the left and right children of the current root's left child to be the current root and the current root's right child, respectively. Then, it sets the current root's left and right children to `null`.

Finally, it returns the new root at the end of the algorithm.

**Method read4:**

The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

Now buf4 =  ""abcd "", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  ""e "", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  "" "", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

    The algorithm relies on the read4 function provided, which reads 4 characters at a time. We read and store these characters in a buffer (`buf4`) and then transfer them one by one into the destination buffer (`buf`) until we reach the desired number of characters (`n`). We repeat this process until we have read `n` characters or reached the end of the `file`. If we reach the end of the file, the read4 function will return less than 4 characters, which is detected and used to break the loop.

In each language, we declare a buffer `buf4` of length 4 to store the characters read using the read4 function. We keep track of the total characters read (`totalRead`) and iterate through the characters in `buf4`, transferring them one by one to the destination buffer `buf`. We make sure not to exceed the requested number of characters `n`.

Once we reach the end of the file, the read4 function will return less than 4 characters. If this happens, we break the loop and return the total number of characters read, which is stored in `totalRead`.

If the number of characters read from `read4` is 0, then we have reached the end of the file, so we break out of the loop.

Next, we copy the characters from `buf4` to the destination buffer `buf` until either we have read enough characters (`cnt` equals `n`), or there are no more characters to copy from `buf4` (`buffer_index` equals `buffer_len`).

    The algorithm implements a sliding window approach. We maintain two pointers `l` and `r` representing the left and right ends of the current substring. We also maintain a hash map `char_count` to store the counts of distinct characters in the current substring.

We iterate through the string with pointer `r`. For each character, we increment its count in the hash map. If we have two or fewer distinct characters in the current substring, we update the current length `cur_len`. If we have more than two distinct characters, we move the pointer `l` to the right, decrementing the count of the character at `l` in the hash map, and removing it if its count becomes zero. We update `cur_len` accordingly in the process.

At each step, we update the maximum length `max_len` with the maximum of `max_len` and `cur_len`. We return `max_len` at the end.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `max_length`: This will store the length of the longest valid substring found so far.
   - `left`: This is the left boundary of the current window.
   - `right`: This is the right boundary of the current window.
   - `char_count`: This is a dictionary that keeps track of the count of each character in the current window.

2. **Iterate Over the String:**
   - Start with `left = 0` and `right = 0`.
   - Move the `right` boundary to the right as long as the number of distinct characters in the window does not exceed 2.
   - If the number of distinct characters exceeds 2, move the `left` boundary to the right until the number of distinct characters is back to 2.
   - Update `max_length` with the maximum length of the valid substring found so far.

3. **Update the Count of Characters:**
   - When moving the `right` boundary, add the current character to the `char_count` dictionary and increment its count.
   - When moving the `left` boundary, remove the character at the `left` boundary from the `char_count` dictionary and decrement its count.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - After iterating through the entire string, return the value of `max_length`.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:","python
def length_of_longest_substring(s):
    max_length = 0
    left = 0

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

*   `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
*   `listA` - The first linked list.
*   `listB` - The second linked list.
*   `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 8, listA = \[4,1,8,4,5\], listB = \[5,6,1,8,4,5\], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[4,1,8,4,5\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[5,6,1,8,4,5\]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 2, listA = \[1,9,1,2,4\], listB = \[3,2,4\], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
**Output:** Intersected at '2'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[1,9,1,2,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[3,2,4\]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = \[2,6,4\], listB = \[1,5\], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[2,6,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[1,5\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
*   The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.

*   `0 <= skipB < n`
*   `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
*   `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

    The algorithm uses two pointers, one for each linked list head (headA and headB). The pointers traverse through the lists such that they traverse the sum of the node count of both lists. If the lists intersect at a node, the pointers will eventually meet at this intersection node because they will have traversed the same number of total nodes. If the lists do not intersect, the pointers will meet at the end of the lists, resulting in both pointers being null, and the function will return null.

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers, one at the head of list A and the other at the head of list B.
2. **Move Pointers**: Move the pointer in list A `skipA` steps forward and the pointer in list B `skipB` steps forward. This ensures that both pointers are at the same relative position in their respective lists.
3. **Check for Intersection**: If the two pointers meet, then the lists intersect at that node. Return the value of the node.
4. **Continue Moving Pointers**: If the two pointers do not meet, continue moving them one step at a time until they either meet or reach the end of their respective lists.

    The algorithm iterates over the nums array and keeps track of the previous number (initialized to lower - 1) keeping in mind that nums is a sorted unique array of elements in the range [lower, upper]. For each number, it checks the difference between the current number and the previous number. If the difference is greater or equal to 2, it adds a range to the result vector. Also, it checks whether the range length is equal to 2, in which case it will only print the starting value of the range, without the ""->"". At the end of the loop, it returns the list of ranges covering the missing numbers in the input range.

3. ** For each element in `nums`, check if there is a gap between the current element and the next element in the array.**

    The algorithm first finds the minimum and maximum values of the input array `nums`. Then it calculates the ideal bucket size by dividing the difference between the maximum and minimum values by the length of the array minus one. The algorithm then initializes an array of buckets, where each bucket contains the minimum and maximum values of its elements.

Next, the algorithm updates the minimum and maximum values for each bucket appropriately by iterating through the input array. Finally, the algorithm calculates the maximum gap by finding the difference between the minimum value of the current bucket and the maximum value of the previous non-empty bucket, and updating the maximum gap value accordingly.

This algorithm runs in linear time, because it iterates through the input array once to fill the buckets, and then it iterates through the buckets once to compute the maximum gap. It also uses linear extra space, as the number of buckets is proportional to the length of the input array.

Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return \[1, 2\]. **Example 2:** **Input:** numbers = \[2,3,4\], target = 6 **Output:** \[1,3\] **Explanation:** The sum of 2 and 4 is 6.

Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return \[1, 2\]. **Constraints:** * `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104` * `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000` * `numbers` is sorted in **non-decreasing order**. * `-1000 <= target <= 1000` * The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**.","To solve the problem of finding two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a specific target, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the beginning and end of the array respectively.
2. While `left` is less than `right`, do the following:
   - Calculate the sum of the elements at the `left` and `right` pointers.
   - If the sum is equal to the target, return the indices of these two elements ( remember to add 1 to each index since the problem asks for the indices added by one).
   - If the sum is less than the target, move the `left` pointer one step to the right ( to increase the sum).
   - If the sum is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer one step to the left ( to decrease the sum).
3. If we have exhausted all possible pairs without finding a solution, return an empty array. However, since the problem guarantees exactly one solution, we don't need to handle this case.

Let's implement this approach in Python:","python

    The algorithm converts an integer `columnNumber` to its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet. It does so by treating the Excel sheet column headers as a Base-26 number system where the numbers are represented by the characters from A-Z.

2. In a while loop, we continue until the `columnNumber` is greater than 0.
3. We subtract 1 from `columnNumber`, as the base representation starts from A (1).
4. The remainder of `columnNumber` divided by 26 is the index of the character in the A-Z range, which is added to the `result` string.
5. `columnNumber` is then divided by 26 and the loop continues until `columnNumber` is 0.

That is, there will be at least a next quantity in the in-order traversal when `next()` is called. **Example 1:** **Input** \[ ""BSTIterator "", ""next "", ""next "", ""hasNext "", ""next "", ""hasNext "", ""next "", ""hasNext "", ""next "", ""hasNext ""\] \[\[\[7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20\]\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\] **Output** \[null, 3, 7, true, 9, true, 15, true, 20, false\] **Explanation** BSTIterator bSTIterator = new BSTIterator(\[7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20\]); bSTIterator.next(); // return 3 bSTIterator.next(); // return 7 bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True bSTIterator.next(); // return 9 bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True bSTIterator.next(); // return 15 bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True bSTIterator.next(); // return 20 bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return False **Constraints:** * The quantity of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 105]`. * `0 <= Node.val <= 106` * At most `105` calls will be made to `hasNext`, and `next`. **Follow up:** * Could you implement `next()` and `hasNext()` to run in average `O(1)` time and use `O(h)` memory, where `h` is the height of the tree?","To implement the `BST iterator` class that represents an in-order traversal of a binary search tree (BST), we can use a stack to keep track of the nodes. The stack will store the nodes in the order they are visited during the in-order traversal. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. ** Initialize the stack and the current node:**
   - Start with the root node of the tree.
   - While the current node has a left child, push the left child onto the stack and move to the left child.
   - If the current node does not have a left child, pop the stack to get the next node in the in-order sequence and move to that node.

2. ** Implement the ` next()` method:**
   - Pop the stack to get the next node in the in-order sequence.
   - Move to the left child of the current node and repeat the process until the current node has no left child.
   - Return the value of the current node.

3. ** Implement the ` hasNext()` method:**
   - Check if the stack is empty. If it is empty, there are no more nodes to visit, so return `false`.
   - Otherwise, there is at least one more node to visit, so return `true`.

Here's the Python code for the ` BST iterator` class:","python

    The algorithm uses dynamic programming to find the minimum health needed in a bottom-up manner by starting from the bottom-right corner of the dungeon to the top-left corner. We create a ""dp"" table with the same size as the dungeon and fill it initially with zeros. Then we iterate over each cell in the dungeon from the bottom-right to the top-left. For each cell, we consider the right and down adjacent cells (if they exist) and calculate the minimum health required to move forward. We update the ""dp"" table with these values. The minimum of the health required to move right or down, plus the current cell dungeon value, is then stored in the current cell in the ""dp"" table. Finally, we return the absolute value of the top-left cell of ""dp"" table plus one (for the initial health point). This gives us the minimum initial health needed to get to the princess.

The base case is:
- \( dp[m-1][n-1] = \max(1, -dungeon[m-1][n-1]) \)
  - If the princess is in a room with a positive health bonus, the knight needs at least 1 health to reach her.
  - If the princess is in a room with a negative health bonus, the knight needs at least \( -dungeon[m-1][n-1} \) health to reach her.

  - The minimum initial health required to reach the bottom-right corner from room \((i, j)\) is the minimum of the initial health required from the next room to the right and the next room below, minus the health change in room \((i, j)\).

Explanation:

The code does not correctly implement the problem requirements. It first splits the input array into a list of words using the `split` method, which is correct. However, it then reverses the list of words using the `reverse` method, which is also correct. However, it then attempts to convert the list back to an array using the `join` method, but this is incorrect because the `join` method requires an iterable of strings, not a list of strings. 

Moreover, the code does not solve the problem in-place, as required by the problem statement. It allocates extra space to store the list of words.

The reasoning score is 2 because the code partially implements the problem requirements, but it does not address the in-place constraint and the issue with the `join` method. 

To solve the problem correctly, the code should reverse the words in-place without allocating extra space. Here is a revised version of the code that implements this:

First, handle the case where `k > n / 2`. If allowed transactions (`k`) are more than half of the available days (`n`), you can simply trade daily by only considering positive profits.

Now, use two nested loops to fill the `dp` table. The outer loop iterates over the allowed transactions (1 to k), and the inner loop iterates over the days (1 to n-1). Inside the inner loop, find the maximum difference between the current day's price and previous days' prices minus the maximum profit after completing one less transaction at previous days (i.e., `prices[j] + dp[i-1][j'] - prices[j']` for all j' < j). This will keep track of the most profitable second transaction after buying a stock at the highest possible profit for the first transaction.

Finally, return the value in the bottom-right corner of the `dp` table (i.e., `dp[k][n-1]`), which provides the maximum profit after completing the allowed number of transactions.

Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3. **Constraints:** * `1 <= k <= 100` * `1 <= prices.length <= 1000` * `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`","To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit we can achieve with at most `j` transactions up to the `i`-th day. The recurrence relation for `dp[i][j]` can be defined as follows:

- If we do not perform any transaction on the `i`-th day, the profit remains the same as the profit we can achieve with `j` transactions up to the `(i-1)`-th day.
- If we perform a transaction on the `i`-th day, we can either buy or sell. If we buy, the profit is the profit we can achieve with `j-1` transactions up to the `(i-1)`-th day minus the price of the stock on the `i`-th day. If we sell, the profit is the profit we can achieve with `j` transactions up to the `(i-1)`-th day plus the price of the stock on the `i`-th day.

The base case is `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `j` because with no transactions, the profit is 0. We will iterate through each day and each possible number of transactions to fill in the `dp` array.

- If we rove house `i`, then we cannot rove house `i-1`, so the maximum amount of money we can Rob from the first `i` houses is the sum of the money in house `i` and the maximum amount of money we can Rob from the first `i-2` houses, i.e., `dp[i] = nums[i] + dp[i-2]`.

- If `i = 0`, then `dp[0] = 0` (we have not roved any houses).
- If `i = 1`, then `dp[1] = nums[1]` (we can rove the first house).

    The function uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the binary tree level by level. We use a queue to keep track of nodes at the current level. 

The algorithm starts by adding the root node to the queue. Then, while the queue is not empty, we iteratively process each level. During each iteration, we calculate the size of the current level, then loop through each node of that level. If we reach the last node of the current level, i.e. `(i == level_size - 1)`, we add that node's value to the result list. After processing the current node, we add its left and right children to the queue if they exist. 

After traversing the entire tree, we return the result list. The algorithm is the same for all languages, with the only differences being syntactical.

Specifically, we will perform a right-to-left DFS, keeping track of the maximum value seen so far at each level of the tree. This way, we can ensure that we only see the rightmost node at each level.

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. **Define the function `right_side_view`**:
   - This function takes the root of the binary tree as input.
   - It returns a list of integers representing the values of the nodes visible from the right side.

2. ** Initialize an empty list `result`**:
   - This list will store the values of the visible nodes.

3. **Define a helper function `dfs`**:
   - This function takes a node and the current maximum value as input.
   - It checks if the node is None. If it is, it returns.
   - If the node is not None, it checks if the value of the node is greater than the current maximum value. If it is, it adds the value to the `result` list.
   - It then calls itself recursively on the right child of the node with the current maximum value.
   - Finally, it calls itself recursively on the left child of the node with the current maximum value.

4. ** Call the `dfs` function on the root node with an initial maximum value of negative infinity**:
   - This ensures that the first node visited at each level will be added to the `result` list.

5. ** Return the `result` list**.

During the DFS traversal, we modify the grid by setting the visited cells containing '1' to '0', which will avoid visiting the same land cell again. The DFS traversal stops when the boundaries of the grid are reached or a '0' cell is hit. The DFS runs recursively on the neighboring cells (up, down, left, and right) of the current cell.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m * n) since we may have to visit every cell in the worst case, where m and n are the row and column dimensions of the grid.

We can use the slow and fast pointer method (also called the Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm). In this method, we have two pointers (`slow` and `fast`), both initially pointing to the input number `n`. In each iteration, the `slow` pointer moves to the next number in the sequence (by calling `getNext()`) while the `fast` pointer moves to the next of next number in the sequence. If at any point, we find that the `fast` pointer becomes 1, it implies that the number is a happy number. If the `slow` and `fast` pointers become equal and it is not 1, it implies that there is a cycle and the number is not a happy number.

2. **Set 0 and 1 as not prime**: Since 0 and 1 are not prime numbers, set `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` to `False`.
3. **Sieve the primes**: Iterate over the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`. For each number `p` that is marked as prime (`is_prime[p]` is `True`), mark all multiples of `p` as not prime. This is done by setting `is_prime[p * p]` to `False` and then incrementing `p` to check the next number.
4. **Count the primes**: After sifting out the non-prime numbers, count the number of `True` values in the `is_prime` list. This count will give us the number of prime numbers less than `n`.

Here's the Python code that implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm:","python
def count_primes(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize a list of boolean values
    is_prime = [True] * n
    
    # Set 0 and 1 as not prime
    is_prime[0] = False
    is_prime[1] = False
    
    # Sieve the primes
    p = 2
    while p * p < n:
        if is_prime[p]:
            for i in range(p * p, n, p):
                is_prime[i] = False
        p += 1
    
    # Count the primes
    prime_count = sum(is_prime)

In the iterative approach, we use three-pointers: `current`, `previous`, and `next`. We start with `current` as the head of the list, `previous` as `None`, and `next` as `current`. As we iterate through the list, we update the pointers such that `next` becomes the new `current`, `current` becomes the new `previous`, and `previous` becomes `None` when `current` is no longer needed.

Topological sort is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed graph such that for every directed edge \(u \rightarrow v\), vertex \(u\) comes before vertex \(v\) in the ordering. If a topological sort exists, the graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and it is possible to finish all courses.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. ** Create a graph from the prerequisites:**
   - Initialize an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Initialize an array to keep track of the in-degrees (number of incoming edges) of each vertex.

2. ** build the graph and in-degrees:**
   - For each prerequisite pair \([ai, bi]\), add an edge from \(bi\) to \(ai\) in the adjacency list and increment the in-degree of \(ai\).

3. ** Find vertices with in-degree 0:**
   - These vertices have no prerequisites and can be taken first. Add them to a queue.

4. ** Perform topological sort:**
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Remove a vertex from the queue.
     - Add this vertex to the topological order.
     - For each neighbor of the removed vertex, decrease its in-degree by 1.
     - If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.

5. ** Check if all vertices are in the topological order:**
   - If the number of vertices in the topological order is equal to the total number of vertices, then it is possible to finish all courses. Otherwise, it is not possible.

    The Trie data structure is implemented as a tree, where each node has a mapping of characters to their corresponding child nodes. Every node also has an `isEndOfWord` flag to indicate if any word ends at this node. 

The `insert` function iterates through each character in a given word, adding new nodes to the tree if they don't already exist, and finally setting the `isEndOfWord` flag to true at the final node.

The `search` function follows the characters from the root of the Trie to the final node, returning false if any character does not map to a child node, otherwise returning the value of the `isEndOfWord` flag at the final node.

The `startsWith` function is similar to `search`, but returns true if a sequence of characters exists in the Trie, regardless of whether a word terminates at the final node.

If there is no such subarray, return `0` instead. **Example 1:** **Input:** target = 7, nums = \[2,3,1,2,4,3\] **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** The subarray \[4,3\] has the minimal length under the problem constraint. **Example 2:** **Input:** target = 4, nums = \[1,4,4\] **Output:** 1 **Example 3:** **Input:** target = 11, nums = \[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\] **Output:** 0 **Constraints:** * `1 <= target <= 109` * `1 <= nums.length <= 105` * `1 <= nums[i] <= 104` **Follow up:** If you have figured out the `O(n)` solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is `O(n log(n))`.","To solve the problem of finding the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to a given target, we can use a two-pointer approach. This approach involves maintaining a sliding window over the array and adjusting the window's size to find the minimum length that meets the target sum.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning and Python code to solve the problem:

1. **Initialize Pointers and Sum:**
   - Set two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the array.
   - Initialize a variable `current_sum` to 0 to keep track of the sum of the elements in the current subarray.

2. **Expand the Right Pointers:**
   - Move the `right` pointer to the right, adding the value of the element at the `right` position to `current_sum`.
   - If `current_sum` becomes greater than or equal to the target, update the minimum length found so far.

3. ** Shrink the Left Pointers:**
   - Move the `left` pointer to the right, subtracting the value of the element at the `left` position from `current_sum`.
   - Continue this process until `current_sum` is less than the target again.

4. **Repeat Steps 2 and 3:**
   - Continue expanding the right pointer and shrinking the left pointer until the `right` pointer reaches the end of the array.

5. **Return the Minimum Length:**
   - If a valid subarray is found, return the minimum length. Otherwise, return 0.

Here is the Python code implementing the above approach:","python
def minSubarrayLength(target, nums):
    left, right = 0, 0
    current_sum = 0
    min_length = float('inf')

    while right < len(nums):
        current_sum += nums[right]
        while current_sum >= target:
            min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)
            current_sum -= nums[left]
            left += 1
        right += 1

    return min_length if min_length!= float('inf') else 0

    This problem can be solved using the Topological Sort algorithm, which works in the following way:
1. Calculate the in-degree (number of incoming edges) of each node/course (use an array called `inDegree`).
2. Initialize an adjacency list, `adjList`, to store the outgoing courses from a prerequisite course.
3. Fill `adjList` while iterating through the prerequisites array.
4. Create a queue, `q`, and enqueue all the nodes whose in-degree is 0; these nodes represent the starting points in this topological sort.
5. Initialize an array or list called `order` to store the final ordering.
6. While `q` is not empty, perform the following steps:
    - Dequeue the front node `curr`.
    - Append `curr` to the `order`.
    - Iterate through all the outgoing courses (neighbors) of `curr`. For each neighboring node `next`, decrease the in-degree of `next` by 1. If the in-degree of `next` becomes 0, enqueue `next` to `q`.
7. Finally, if the length of the `order` is equal to the total number of courses, return the `order`. Otherwise, return an empty array/list, indicating that it is impossible to finish all the courses.

Topological sort is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed graph such that for every directed edge `u -> v`, vertex `u` comes before `v` in the ordering. This problem can be represented as a directed graph where each course is a vertex and each prerequisite is a directed edge.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. ** Create a graph from the prerequisites:**
   - Initialize an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Initialize a list to keep track of the in-degrees (number of incoming edges) for each vertex.

2. ** Fill the adjacency list and in-degrees:**
   - For each prerequisite pair `[ai, bi]`, add an edge from `ai` to `bi` in the adjacency list and increment the in-degree of `bi`.

3. ** Find vertices with in-degree 0:**
   - These vertices have no prerequisites and can be taken first. Add them to a queue.

4. ** Perform topological sort:**
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Remove a vertex from the queue.
     - Add this vertex to the result list.
     - For each neighbor of the removed vertex, decrease its in-degree by 1.
     - If the in-degree of a neighbor becomes 0, add it to the queue.

5. ** Check if all vertices have been processed:**
   - If the result list has the same length as the number of courses, return the result list. Otherwise, return an empty array, indicating that it is impossible to finish all courses.

    We use a Trie data structure to store the words. Each Trie node has an array of child pointers for all lowercase English letters (size 26) and a boolean flag `is_word` indicating if the word ends at this node. Initially, all child pointers are set to null, and `is_word` is set to false.

When we add a word, we walk through the Trie, creating new child nodes if necessary, and set `is_word` to true for the last Trie node representing the word's last character.

When we search for a word, we use a helper function that takes the current Trie node, the word, and the current position in the word. If the current character in the word is a dot (`.`), we search for any matching character by iterating through all its children, recursively calling the helper function with the next position in the word. If the current character in the word is a lowercase letter, we proceed to the corresponding child node and continue the search.

At any point, if we reach the word's end, we check if the `is_word` of the current Trie node is true. If it is, we found a match. Otherwise, the search continues.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the DFS function**: The DFS function will take the current position on the board, the current word being formed, and the board itself. It will recursively explore all possible paths from the current position and check if the word formed is in the list of words.

2. **Initialize the result list**: Create an empty list to store all the words found on the board.

3. **Iterate through each cell on the board**: For each cell, check if it is within the bounds of the board and if it has not been used in the current word. If it meets these conditions, add it to the current word and recursively call the DFS function with the new position and the updated word. If the word formed is in the list of words, add it to the result list.

Since the houses are arranged in a circle, we cannot rob two adjacent houses. We can break down the problem into two subproblems: robing houses from the first to the second-to-last house, and robing houses from the second to the last house. The maximum amount of money we can robust is the maximum of these two subproblems.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the subproblems:**
   - Let `dp[i]` be the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from houses `1` to `i` without alerting the police.
   - We need to find `dp[n-1]` and `dp[n-2]` where `n` is the number of houses.

2. **Base cases:**
   - If there is only one house, the maximum amount of money that can be robbed is `nums[0]`.
   - If there are two houses, the maximum amount of money that can be robbed is the maximum of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`.

3. **Recurrence relation:**
   - For `i >= 3`, the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from houses `1` to `i` is the maximum of robing houses from `1` to `i-1` and robing houses from `2` to `i-1` plus the amount of money in house `i`. This can be written as:
     \[
     dp[i] = \max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])
     \]

4. **Calculate `dp[n-1]` and `dp[n-2]$:**
   - First, calculate `dp[i]` for `i` from `3` to `n-1` using the recurrence relation.
   - Then, find the maximum of `dp[n-1]` and `dp[n-2]`.

5. ** handling the circular arrangement:**
   - We need to consider two cases: robing houses from the first to the second-to-last house and robing houses from the second to the last house.
   - The maximum amount of money that can be robbed is the maximum of these two cases.

In the case of the C++ and Python implementations, the built-in `sort()` method was used to sort the array in descending order, while in the Java implementation, a min-heap was used for efficiency. In the Javascript implementation, the custom comparator `(a, b) => b - a` was used to sort the input array in descending order.

def getSkyline(buildings):

    for l, r, h in buildings:
        points.append((l, -h))
        points.append((r, h))

    The algorithm starts by iterating through all the given buildings and creating a list of x-coordinates paired with the height of the buildings, where the left points are negated. We then sort the list of points by x-coordinate. Additionally, we also create a sorted multiset (C++)/TreeSet (Java)/SortedList (Python)/SortedSet (JavaScript) of building heights, initialized with a single 0 height.

Next, we iterate through the sorted points. If the height is negative, meaning it's a left point of a building, we add the absolute value of the height to the heights set. If the height is positive, meaning it's a right point of a building, we remove the height from the heights set.

At each iteration, we compare the current maximum height to the previous maximum height. If the current maximum height is different from the previous maximum height, it means we've reached a key point in the skyline, so we add this x-coordinate and the current maximum height to the skyline result list. 

This algorithm ensures we receive a sorted list of key points in the skyline, without consecutive horizontal lines of equal height.
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, A city's **skyline** is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return _the **skyline** formed by these buildings collectively_. The geometric information of each building is given in the array `buildings` where `buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]`: * `lefti` is the x coordinate of the left edge of the `ith` building. * `righti` is the x coordinate of the right edge of the `ith` building. * `heighti` is the height of the `ith` building. You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`. The **skyline** should be represented as a list of ""key points "" **sorted by their x-coordinate** in the form `[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour. **Note:** There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]` **Example 1:** **Input:** buildings = \[\[2,9,10\],\[3,7,15\],\[5,12,12\],\[15,20,10\],\[19,24,8\]\] **Output:** \[\[2,10\],\[3,15\],\[7,12\],\[12,0\],\[15,10\],\[20,8\],\[24,0\]\] **Explanation:** Figure A shows the buildings of the input. Figure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in figure B represent the key points in the output list. **Example 2:** **Input:** buildings = \[\[0,2,3\],\[2,5,3\]\] **Output:** \[\[0,3\],\[5,0\]\] **Constraints:** * `1 <= buildings.length <= 104` * `0 <= lefti < righti <= 231 - 1` * `1 <= heighti <= 231 - 1` * `buildings` is sorted by `lefti` in non-decreasing order.","To solve the problem of finding the skyline formed by a set of buildings, we can use a divide-and-conquer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Divide the buildings into two halves**: If the number of buildings is more than one, divide the list of buildings into two equal halves.
2. **Recursively find the skyline for each half**: Solve the problem for the left half and the right half.
3. **Combine the two skylines**:合并 the two skylines by finding the intersection points and ensuring that the resulting skyline does not have consecutive horizontal lines of equal height.

This can be done by traversing the tree in a depth-first search (DFS) manner or by using a level order traversal. However, a more efficient way is to use the property of binary trees that the height can be found by counting the number of times we can divide the height by 2 until we reach 1.

2. **Calculate the number of nodes**: Once we have the height \( h \), we can calculate the number of nodes in the tree. If the tree is a complete binary tree, it will have \( 2^h - 1 \) nodes if the last level is not completely filled, or \( 2^{h+1} - 1 \) nodes if the last level is completely filled.

Here is the Python code to implement this algorithm:","python
def count_nodes(root):
    if root is None:
        return 0
    
    # Determine the height of the tree
    height = 0
    while root:
        root = root left
        height += 1
    
    # Calculate the number of nodes in the tree
    if root:
        return 2 ** height - 1
    else:
        return 2 ** (height + 1) - 1

*   `int pop()` Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
*   `int top()` Returns the element on the top of the stack.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the stack is empty, `false` otherwise.

*   You must use **only** standard operations of a queue, which means that only `push to back`, `peek/pop from front`, `size` and `is empty` operations are valid.

1. Initialize `result`, `num`, `sign`, and a stack.
2. Loop through the given string, character by character.
3. If the character is a digit, update `num` accordingly.
4. If the character is a '+' or '-', update the `result` with the current `num` and update the `sign`.
5. If the character is an '(', push the current `result` and `sign` onto the stack and reset `result` and `sign`.
6. If the character is a ')', update `result` with the current `num`, then multiply `result` by the top of the stack (pop), and add the next top of the stack (pop) to `result`.
7. After the loop, add the current `num` to the result if it's not 0.

2. Initialize a variable `current_number` to store the current number being read.
3. Initialize a variable `current_operation` to store the current operation being performed.
4. Iterate through each character in the string `s`.
5. If the character is a digit, update `current_number` by appending the digit.
6. If the character is an operator, perform the operation on `current_number` and `result` using the current `current_operation` and update `result` accordingly. Then, reset `current_number` to 0 and update `current_operation`.

    The algorithm involves iterating through the input array and using a variable named `start` to keep track of the beginning of the current range. For each element, we compare it with the previous element to check if they form a continuous range by verifying if the current element is greater than the previous element plus 1. If they don't form a continuous range, we know that the current range has ended and a new range starts at the current element. So, we add the current range to the result in the required format and update the start variable to the current element. This process continues until all elements are processed. Finally, we add the last range to the result in the required format.

Since the input array is sorted and unique, this greedy approach ensures that we find the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array.

Implement the `MyQueue` class: * `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue. * `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it. * `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue. * `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise. **Notes:** * You must use **only** standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid. * Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations. **Example 1:** **Input** \[ ""MyQueue "", ""push "", ""push "", ""peek "", ""pop "", ""empty ""\] \[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\] **Output** \[null, null, null, 1, 1, false\] **Explanation** MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue(); myQueue.push(1); // queue is: \[1\] myQueue.push(2); // queue is: \[1, 2\] (leftmost is front of the queue) myQueue.peek(); // return 1 myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is \[2\] myQueue.empty(); // return false **Constraints:** * `1 <= x <= 9` * At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`. * All the calls to `pop` and `peek` are valid. **Follow-up:** Can you implement the queue such that each operation is **[amortized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis)** `O(1)` time complexity? In other words, performing `n` operations will take overall `O(n)` time even if one of those operations may take longer.","To implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks, we can use one stack to represent the front of the queue and the other stack to represent the back of the queue. Here's how we can do it:

1. **Push**: To push an element `x` to the back of the queue, we simply push `x` onto the back stack.
2. **Pop**: To pop an element from the front of the queue, we need to check if the front stack is empty. If it is empty, we need to move all elements from the back stack to the front stack. Then, we pop the top element from the front stack.
3. **Peek**: To peek at the element at the front of the queue, we check if the front stack is empty. If it is empty, we need to move all elements from the back stack to the front stack. Then, we return the top element from the front stack.
4. **Empty**: To check if the queue is empty, we check if both the front stack and the back stack are empty.

2. On each iteration, the algorithm checks how many times 1's appear in the current digit:

1. **Convert the number to a string**: This allows us to iterate over each digit of the number.
2. **Count the occurrences of the digit `1` in the string representation of `n`**: This gives us the count of `1`s in the number itself.
3. **Count the occurrences of the digit `1` in all numbers less than `n`**: We can break this down by considering each digit position from the most significant to the least significant.

For each digit position, we can calculate the number of times `1` appears in that position by considering the following:
- If the digit at the current position is `0`, then `1` does not appear in that position.
- If the digit at the current position is `1`, then `1` appears in that position for all combinations of the remaining digits.
- If the digit at the current position is greater than `1`, then `1` appears in that position for all combinations of the remaining digits.

We mean: * The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list. * The quantity of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one. * All the values before `node` should be in the same order. * All the values after `node` should be in the same order. **Custom testing:** * For the input, you should provide the entire linked list `head` and the node to be given `node`. `node` should not be the last node of the list and should be an actual node in the list. * We will build the linked list and pass the node to your function. * The output will be the entire list after calling your function. **Example 1:** **Input:** head = \[4,5,1,9\], node = 5 **Output:** \[4,1,9\] **Explanation:** You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function. **Example 2:** **Input:** head = \[4,5,1,9\], node = 1 **Output:** \[4,5,9\] **Explanation:** You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function. **Constraints:** * The quantity of the nodes in the given list is in the range `[2, 1000]`. * `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000` * The value of each node in the list is **unique**. * The `node` to be deleted is **in the list** and is **not a tail** node.","To solve the problem of deleting a node from a singly linked list without being given access to the first node, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the node to be deleted**: We are given the node `node` to be deleted.
2. **Set the next value of the node before the node to be deleted**: Since we don't have access to the first node, we need to find the node before the node to be deleted. We can do this by iterating from the head of the list to the node to be deleted. Once we find the node before the node to be deleted, we set its next value to the next node of the node to be deleted.
3. **Remove the node to be deleted**: After setting the next value of the node before the node to be deleted, we can remove the node to be deleted by updating the next value of the node to be deleted to `None`.

    The basic idea is to create an array `answer` with the same size as `nums`. We start by initializing all elements of the `answer` array to 1.

We then perform two passes through the `nums` array. During the first pass, we keep track of the running product of elements to the left of the current index in a variable called `left`, and we multiply the corresponding element in the `answer` array by this running product.

During the second pass, we move in the reverse direction, and we perform a similar operation for the elements to the right of the current index using a variable called `right`. This will result in `answer[i]` being equal to the product of all elements in the `nums` array except for the current element, `nums[i]`.

Since we only have two passes through the input array, the algorithm has an O(n) time complexity.

These sub-problems are independently solved through recursively calling the `diffWaysToCompute` function with corresponding substrings. 

Each recursion returns a list of possible results for each sub-problem. For each operator, we combine these results by iterating through both lists and performing the corresponding operation (addition, subtraction, or multiplication).

If no operators are present in the input string, a base case is reached, and the current number in the input string is returned as the only result. The recursion ultimately produces a list of all possible results for the original expression by combining results from all sub-problems.

It then iterates through the string `t`. For each character in `t`, it checks if the frequency count of that character in the hash table is greater than 0. If it is not, that means the character either wasn't in the string `s`, or has been used up already, so the function returns `false`.

We will create a helper function that takes two arguments m and n where m represents the remaining length of the number, and n represents the original length of the number. This helper function will return the strobogrammatic numbers of that length as a space-separated string.

In the helper function:

1. If m is 0, we return an empty string.
2. If m is 1, we return ""0 1 8"" representing the single-digit strobogrammatic numbers.
3. If n is 0, we return ""11 69 88 96"" representing the two-digit strobogrammatic numbers.

For each character `a` in the strobogrammatic numbers of length `m-2`:

1. If m is not equal to n, add a '0' in between the characters and concatenate to the result string.
2. Add '1', '6', '8', and '9' in between the characters, and concatenate to the result string.

Then, in the strobogrammaticInRange function, we iterate through the range of lengths from `low` to `high`. For each length, we check if the strobogrammatic number of that length is within the range `[low, high]`, and if it is, we increase the count by 1.

Finally, we return the total count of strobogrammatic numbers within the specified range.

```
    
    The idea is to create a unique key for each group of strings, that depends on the relative distances between characters in a string. We iterate through the given strings and create the key for each string by taking the difference between the ASCII code of each character and that of the first character, modulo 26. We add these deltas as comma-separated elements and use them as the key in a map. Where a map is a hashmap in C++ and Java, defaultdict in Python, and Map in JavaScript. For each string, we append it to the list of strings corresponding to its group (key) in the map.

After iterating through all the strings, we return the list of groups from the map.

Note that the modulo operation and `<code>26</code>` come from the number of lowercase English letters which is 26. So, any shift greater than 25 will simply wrap around to the initial letters.

3. **Group the strings based on their shifting sequences**: We use a dictionary to group the strings based on their shifting sequences. The key of the dictionary will be a tuple representing the shifting sequence, and the value will be a list of strings that belong to that sequence.

2. We recursively call the helper function for the left and right nodes of the current node.

3. If both left and right subtrees return `true`, it means that they are both unival subtrees.

If the values are the same, we increment the count and return `true` for the current node.

1. **Define the function**: Let's call the function `count_uni_value_subtrees`. It takes a `root` node as its input and returns the count of uni-value subtrees.

We keep track of the current path, which represents the factors found so far. When `n` equals 1, we check if the current path has more than one element. If it does, we add the current combination of factors to the result.

To avoid duplicates, we ensure that the next factor in the sequence is greater than or equal to the previous one by passing a ""start"" variable in the helper function. This ensures that we always explore factors in a non-decreasing order.

At each recursive step, we first check if the current value of `n` is divisible by the current factor (i.e., it has no remainder when divided). If it is, we update the path with the current factor and call the helper function with the updated value of `n` divided by the current factor. After the recursive call returns, we remove the last factor from the path to backtrack to the previous level and explore other factors.

    ","Considering the aforementioned details, Given an integer `num`, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it. **Example 1:** **Input:** num = 38 **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** The process is 38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11 11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 Since 2 has only one digit, return it. **Example 2:** **Input:** num = 0 **Output:** 0 **Constraints:** * `0 <= num <= 231 - 1` **Follow up:** Could you do it without any loop/recursion in `O(1)` runtime?","To solve the problem of repeatedly adding the digits of an integer `num` until the result has only one digit, we can use the concept of the digital root. The digital root of a number is the value obtained by an iterative process of summing digits, on each iteration using the result from the previous iteration to compute a digit sum. The digital root of a non-zero integer is the single digit number that is equivalent to the original number modulo 9, with the exception that the digital root of 9 is 9.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. If `num` is 0, the digital root is 0.
2. If `num` is not 0, the digital root is `num % 9` if `num % 9` is not 0. If `num % 9` is 0, the digital root is 9.

This works because the sum of the digits of a number is congruent to the number itself modulo 9. Therefore, repeatedly summing the digits of a number until a single digit is obtained will result in a number that is congruent to the original number modulo 9.

Then we loop through each element in the array and use two pointers, `j` and `k`, initialized to the following element and the last element in the sorted array, respectively. We repeat the process until `j` is less than `k`. Inside the loop, we check if the sum of `nums[i]`, `nums[j]`, and `nums[k]` is less than the target.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Sort the array**: First, we sort the array `nums` in non-decreasing order. This will allow us to use the two-pointer approach efficiently.

2. **Iterate through the array**: We iterate through the array with a loop where the index \(i\) goes from 0 to \(n-3\) (since \(i < j < k\), \(i\) must be at most \(n-3\)).

3. **Fix the first element**: For each fixed \(i\), we need to find pairs \((j, k)\) such that \(nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target\). This can be rewritten as \(nums[j] + nums[k] < target - nums[i]\).

4. **Use two-pointers**: We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to find pairs \((j, k)\) that satisfy the condition \(nums[j] + nums[k] < target - nums[i]\). The `left` pointer starts at \(i+1\) and the `right` pointer starts at \(n-1\). We move the `left` pointer to the right and the `right` pointer to the left until they meet or the condition is no longer satisfied.

5. **Count valid pairs**: For each valid pair \((j, k)\), we increment the count of valid triplets by the number of positions the `left` pointer has moved. This is because each position the `left` pointer moves to the right corresponds to a new valid pair \((j, k)\).

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:","python

    The algorithm uses XOR operation to find the two unique numbers. First, we XOR all numbers in the array (which cancels out the repeating numbers), and the result of this XOR operation is actually the XOR of the two unique numbers. Then, we find the rightmost bit that is set to 1 in this XOR result. This bit will be different for the two unique numbers.

Next, we split the numbers into two groups: one group has that bit set, and the other group doesn't. XOR all numbers in both groups separately, and the result of the XOR operation for each group will be one of the unique numbers. This is because, within each group, the equal numbers will cancel themselves out, leaving the unique numbers as the result.

This algorithm has a linear runtime complexity (O(n)) and uses constant extra space, as required.

Let's define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to paint the first `i` houses such that the `i`-th house is painted with color `j`.

The recurrence relation for `dp[i][j]` can be defined as:
\[ dp[i][j] = \min_{\substack{1 \leq m \leq k \\ m \neq j}} (dp[i-1][m]) + costs[i][j] \]
This means that the minimum cost to paint the `i`-th house with color `j` is the minimum cost to paint the `(i-1)`-th house with any color other than `j`, plus the cost of painting the `i`-th house with color `j`.

We can initialize the `dp` array for the first house as:
\[ dp[0][j] = costs[0][j] \]

    The algorithm counts the occurrences of each character in the string using a hash map (or dictionary for Python). Then, it iterates through the count values in the hash map and checks how many characters have odd occurrences. If the string can form a palindrome, there should be at most one character having an odd number of occurrences.

The logic is based on the fact that a string can form a palindrome if it meets the following condition: If the string length is even, there should be an even number of occurrences for each character. If the string length is odd, there should be only one character having odd occurrences and the rest should have even occurrences.

The algorithm simply returns true if the odd_count is less than or equal to 1, indicating the string can form a palindrome; otherwise, it returns false.

    The algorithm uses the topological sorting algorithm with an adjacency list to represent the directed graph. The directed graph's vertices represent each unique character from the words array, and a directed edge between two vertices indicates that the first character appears before the second character in the alien language's dictionary.

It first initializes an adjacency list `graph`, an in-degree HashMap `inDegree` to store the in-degree of each character, and fills the HashMap with the unique characters from the words array, setting the initial in-degree of each character to 0. Then, it iterates through adjacent word pairs from the `words` array and adjacent character pairs from those word pairs, checking if they form an edge in the graph (i.e., the characters are different). If an edge is found, it is added to the graph, and the in-degree of the second character in the pair is incremented. In case we traverse through equal characters and later find the second string is shorter, we return an empty string as this indicates an invalid order.

To find the lexicographical order, we can use the topological sorting algorithm. We initialize a queue to store the characters with an in-degree of 0 (i.e. they have no incoming edges) and perform the following steps until the queue is empty:

1. Pop the front character from the queue and append it to the result string.
2. Iterate over all the neighbors of the popped character in the graph.
3. Decrement the in-degree of each neighbor.
4. Check if the in-degree of the neighbor is 0; if it is, push the character onto the queue.

Finally, if the length of the result string is less than the number of unique characters, return an empty string as it indicates there's no valid lexicographical order. Otherwise, return the result string.

2. **弹珠 the dependencies:**
   - For each word in the list, iterate through its letters and add dependencies. If a letter appears before another letter in the word, it depends on the letter that comes before it.

3. **Perform topological sort:**
   - Use a queue to perform the topological sort. Start with letters that have no dependencies.
   - Remove a letter from the queue, add it to the result, and update the dependencies of the remaining letters.

4. **Check for cycles:**
   - If the queue is empty but not all letters have been added to the result, there is a cycle in the graph, and there is no valid order. Return an empty string.

    The algorithm concatenates each string with its length and a delimiter (in this case '#'). For example, [""Hello "", ""World ""] would be encoded into ""6#Hello 6#World "" (6 is the length of both ""Hello "" and ""World "").

When decoding, the receiving side searches for the delimiter and extracts the string's length just before each delimiter. It then uses that length to extract the original string extending from the position after the delimiter. It iterates over the received encoded string until all substrings have been extracted.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

   Perform an in-order traversal of the binary search tree to convert it into a sorted list. This is because the in-order traversal of a binary search tree yields a sorted sequence of its elements.

   Use binary search to find the index of the target value in the sorted list. If the target value is not found, find the index where it would be if it were inserted into the list.

3. **Determine the Range of indices:**
   Once we have the index of the target value, we need to determine the range of indices in the sorted list that are closest to the target value. This range will be centered around the index of the target value.

   Extract the \( k \) values from the sorted list within the determined range.

    The algorithm is based on binary search. The idea is to find the pivot index 'mid' such that there are 'mid' number of elements greater than or equal to 'mid'. Since the array is sorted, we can leverage binary search by comparing the middle element's value to the number of elements on its right side (which can be calculated as 'n - mid'). If the number of elements on the right side is equal to the value at mid, we found the h-index. Otherwise, if the number of elements on the right side is less than the value at mid, we move our search to the left half of the array. If the number of elements is greater than the value at mid, we move our search to the right half of the array. This process ensures logarithmic time complexity as we eliminate half of the array in each iteration. Once our search is complete (right becomes less than left), we return the final h-index as 'n - left'.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Binary Search Approach:**
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array respectively.
   - While `left` is less than or equal to `right`, do the following:
     - Calculate the middle index `mid` as \( \left( \frac{left + right}{2} \right) \).
     - Check if the citations at index `mid` are at least `mid` (i.e., \( citations[mid] \geq mid \)).
       - If true, then the h-index could be at least `mid`. Set `right` to \( mid - 1 \).
       - If false, then the h-index cannot be `mid` or greater. Set `left` to \( mid + 1 \).
   - After the loop, the h-index will be the value of `left` minus 1 (since `left` is the smallest index where \( citations[left-1] < left-1 \)).

```
    
    We start with two cases when n equals to 0 or 1.
If n equals 0, it means there are no posts, so the result will be 0.
If n equals 1, it means there is only one post and k colors to choose from, so the result will be k.

After that, we create two variables: `same` and `different`. `same` stores the number of ways to color a fence at position i, such that the color of post i is the same as that of post i-1. `different` stores the number of ways to color the post at position i, such that the color of post i is different from that of post i-1.

For the first two posts, there are k ways to paint them the same color, and k*(k-1) ways to paint them different colors.

Then we use a loop starting from the third post (i=2) to the last post (i=n-1).
At each iteration, we update `different` by adding the previous `same` and `different` values and multiply by (k-1). This is because for different colors, they can either come from previous same colors or different colors, hence the addition. And then we multiply it by (k-1) to consider all possible color combinations excluding the previous color. After that, we update `same` by the previous `different` value, because now we need to consider the current post having the same color as the previous post.

Finally, we return the total number of ways which is the sum of `same` and `different`.

Let's define \( dp[i][j] \) as the number of ways to paint the first \( i \) posts such that the \( i \)-th post is painted with color \( j \).

The base cases are:
- For \( i = 1 \), any of the \( k \) colors can be used, so \( dp[1][j] = 1 \) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( k \).
- For \( i = 2 \), any of the \( k \) colors can be used for the second post, so \( dp[2][j] = k \) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( k \).

For \( i \geq 3 \), the \( i \)-th post can be painted with color \( j \) if the \((i-1)\)-th post is painted with a different color or the \((i-2)\)-th post is painted with a different color than the \((i-1)\)-th post. Therefore, we have:
\[ dp[i][j] = \sum_{l \neq j} dp[i-1][l] + \sum_{l \neq j} dp[i-2][l] \]
This can be simplified to:
\[ dp[i][j] = (k-1) \cdot (dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-2][j]) \]

However, a more efficient way to compute this is to use the following recurrence relation:
\[ dp[i] = (k-1) \cdot (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) \]

2. **Recursively find the celebrity in each group**: Use the `knows` function to determine which group contains the celebrity. If a person in the first group knows everyone in the second group, then the celebrity must be in the first group. Otherwise, the celebrity must be in the second group.

3. **Base case**: If \( n = 1 \), then the only person is the celebrity.

4. **Combine the results**: Once we have found the celebrity in each group, we need to check if the celebrity from the first group knows everyone in the second group and if the celebrity from the second group knows everyone in the first group.

    The algorithm used here is a binary search approach which starts with the range from the first to the last version. In each iteration, it takes the middle point and checks if it's a bad version by calling `isBadVersion()` API.

If the middle version is bad, this means that the first bad version is either the middle version or somewhere on the left side of the range. So, we update the right end of the range to the middle version.

If the middle version is not bad, the first bad version must be somewhere on the right side of the range. So, we update the left end of the range to the middle version + 1.

The loop will continue until the left and right pointers converge, indicating that we have found the first bad version. As a result, we return the value of the left pointer.

This algorithm has a complexity of O(log n), as it reduces the search range by half at each iteration hence minimizing the number of calls to the API.

We set `dp[0]` to `0` because it takes zero square numbers to sum up to zero. We fill the rest of the DP array with a maximum or infinite value, depending on the language used.

We iterate through the DP array from index `1` to index `n`, inclusive. For each index `i`, we iterate through all perfect square numbers `j * j` smaller than or equal to `i` to find the least number of perfect square numbers that sum up to `i`. We update the `dp` array with the minimum value of the current value at `dp[i]` and `dp[i - j * j] + 1`.

After completing the iterations, the value at `dp[n]` represents the least number of perfect squares that sum to `n`.
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, Given an integer `n`, return _the least quantity of perfect square numbers that sum to_ `n`. A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, `1`, `4`, `9`, and `16` are perfect squares while `3` and `11` are not. **Example 1:** **Input:** n = 12 **Output:** 3 **Explanation:** 12 = 4 + 4 + 4. **Example 2:** **Input:** n = 13 **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** 13 = 4 + 9. **Constraints:** * `1 <= n <= 104`","To solve the problem of finding the least quantity of perfect square numbers that sum to a given integer `n`, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize the DP Array**: Create an array `dp` of size `n+1` where `dp[i]` will store the minimum number of perfect squares that sum to `i`. Initialize `dp[0]` to 0 because 0 can be represented as the sum of 0 perfect squares.

2. ** Fill the DP Array**: For each integer `i` from 1 to `n`, iterate through all perfect squares `j*j` (where `j*j <= i`) and update `dp[i]` as `min(dp[i], dp[i - j*j] + 1)`. This means that the minimum number of perfect squares that sum to `i` is the minimum of the current value of `dp[i]` and the minimum number of perfect squares that sum to `i - j*j` plus one.

3. **Return the Result**: After filling the DP array, `dp[n]` will contain the minimum number of perfect squares that sum to `n`.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:","python

    The algorithm is based on a backtracking approach. We initialize a helper function with the initial parameters, such as the starting position, expression, and running sum. The helper function is then called recursively for each possible operator insertion. When the position reaches the end of the input string, we check if the running sum equals the target. If it does, we add the current expression to the result.

We use these parameters in the helper function:

- `pos`: The current position in the input string
- `currVal`: The current value of the expression up until this point
- `prevVal`: The value before the last operator we inserted
- `currExpr`: The expression string that we are building up

To avoid leading zeros in operands, we use a check to terminate the loop if we encounter a zero at the start.

Inside the helper function, we iterate over the possible next positions ('i') in the input string and decide which operation to perform at the current position:

1. Base case: When the current position is 0, we simply update the current value and expression with no operator.
2. Addition: We update the current value by adding the parsed value, and append ""+"" followed by the substring to the expression.
3. Subtraction: We update the current value by subtracting the parsed value, and append ""-"" followed by the substring to the expression.
4. Multiplication: We update the current value by first subtracting the previous value, then adding the product of the previous value and the parsed value, and append ""*"" followed by the substring to the expression.

After the helper function iterates through all possibilities, we return the result as a list of expressions that evaluate to the target value.

1. **Define a recursive function** `find_expressions` that takes the current index `i` in the string `num`, the current expression `expr`, and the current value `val` of the expression.
2. **Base case**: If the current index `i` is equal to the length of the string `num`, check if the current value `val` equals the target. If it does, add the current expression `expr` to the result list.
3. **Recursive case**: For each index `i`, consider three possible operations: `+`, `-`, and `*`. For each operation, update the expression and the value, and make a recursive call with the next index `i+1`.
4. **Convert the string to a number**: When updating the value, convert the substring from `num[i]` to the end of the current expression to a number.

    The PeekingIterator class implements an iterator that supports the peek operation in addition to the regular hasNext and next methods. The constructor takes an existing iterator or iterable object, and initializes the class variables for keeping track of the next value and the internal iterator.

The peek method returns the next value in the sequence, without advancing the internal iterator. The next method returns the next value in the sequence and advances the internal iterator by calling its next method. The hasNext method checks if there are more elements left in the sequence by checking if the internal iterator's next value is not the end.

In all these implementations:

- C++ implementation uses the STL iterator standards and a vector iterator as input
- Java implementation uses the Iterator interface and expects an iterator of any collection implementing Iterable
- Python implementation accepts any iterable object as the input.
- JavaScript implementation assumes given input iterable supports the iterator protocol


    ","Considering the aforementioned details, Design an iterator that supports the `peek` operation on an existing iterator in addition to the `hasNext` and the `next` operations.

Here's the step-by-step implementation in Python:

1. **Initialize the `PeedingIterator` object with the given integer iterator ` iterator`.**
   - Create a new data structure (e.g., a tuple or a class) to store the next element in the array and the current position in the original iterator.
   - Initialize this data structure with the next element from the original iterator and the current position (which is initially 0).

2. **Implement the `next` method.**
   - If the next element is `None` (i.e., we have reached the end of the array), raise an exception.
   - Otherwise, return the next element and update the data structure to store the next element in the array and the next position.

3. **Implement the ` hasNext` method.**
   - Check if the next element is `None`. If it is, return `False`. Otherwise, return `True`.

4. **Implement the `peek` method.**
   - Return the next element without moving the pointer. This can be done by simply returning the next element from the data structure without updating it.

Here's the Python code for the `PeedingIterator` class:","python
class PeedingIterator:
    def __init__(self, iterator):

In this case, we update the `successor` to the current root and then move to the left subtree by updating the root to its left child. If the root's value is not greater than the value of the given node, we move to the right subtree by updating the root to its right child.

At the end of the loop, when the `root` is `null`, the `successor` variable now holds our answer - the in-order successor of the given node `p` in the BST. If no in-order successor exists, it holds `null`. We return the `successor` variable.

2. **If the node `p` does not have a right child:**
   - The in-order successor is the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of `p` and its rightmost ancestor. This is because the rightmost ancestor of `p` will be the smallest node greater than `p` in the tree.

While the queue is not empty, we loop through all the gates in the queue, and for each gate, we explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right) and check if they are empty rooms. If they are, we update their distance to be 1 more than the current gate's distance, and add these neighbors to the queue. Once a room's distance is updated, it will not be updated again because that's the shortest distance found. The process continues until all reachable empty rooms have their distances updated.

This algorithm operates in O(m*n) time complexity, where m and n are the dimensions of the grid rooms, since each cell is visited once.

     - For each of the four adjacent rooms (up, down, left, right), check if it is within the grid and not visited.

    The algorithm first initializes the class by storing the words into a hash map with their abbreviations as keys and a set containing the words with this abbreviation as the value. This allows for efficient lookups and eliminates duplicates in the `dictionary`.

For the `isUnique` function, the algorithm first gets the abbreviation of the `word`. Then, it checks whether the abbreviation is not present in the hash map or whether the abbreviation is present with only one word (the same as the input word) in the set. If either of these conditions is met, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

The `get_abbreviation` function returns the abbreviated version of a given `word`. If the length of the `word` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns the `word` itself; otherwise, it returns the first character, the number of characters between the first and last characters, and the last character of the `word` as a string.
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, The **abbreviation** of a word is a concatenation of its first letter, the quantity of characters between the first and last letter, and its last letter. If a word has only two characters, then it is an **abbreviation** of itself. For example: * `dog --> d1g` because there is one letter between the first letter `'d'` and the last letter `'g'`. * `internationalization --> i18n` because there are 18 letters between the first letter `'i'` and the last letter `'n'`. * `it --> it` because any word with only two characters is an **abbreviation** of itself. Implement the `ValidWordAbbr` class: * `ValidWordAbbr(String[] dictionary)` Initializes the object with a `dictionary` of words. * `boolean isUnique(string word)` Returns `true` if **either** of the following conditions are met (otherwise returns `false`): * There is no word in `dictionary` whose **abbreviation** is equal to `word`'s **abbreviation**. * For any word in `dictionary` whose **abbreviation** is equal to `word`'s **abbreviation**, that word and `word` are **the same**. **Example 1:** **Input** \[ ""ValidWordAbbr "", ""isUnique "", ""isUnique "", ""isUnique "", ""isUnique "", ""isUnique ""\] \[\[\[ ""deer "", ""door "", ""cake "", ""card ""\]\], \[ ""dear ""\], \[ ""cart ""\], \[ ""cane ""\], \[ ""make ""\], \[ ""cake ""\]\] **Output** \[null, false, true, false, true, true\] **Explanation** ValidWordAbbr validWordAbbr = new ValidWordAbbr(\[ ""deer "", ""door "", ""cake "", ""card ""\]); validWordAbbr.isUnique( ""dear ""); // return false, dictionary word ""deer "" and word ""dear "" have the same abbreviation ""d2r "" but are not the same. validWordAbbr.isUnique( ""cart ""); // return true, no words in the dictionary have the abbreviation ""c2t "". validWordAbbr.isUnique( ""cane ""); // return false, dictionary word ""cake "" and word ""cane "" have the same abbreviation ""c2e "" but are not the same. validWordAbbr.isUnique( ""make ""); // return true, no words in the dictionary have the abbreviation ""m2e "". validWordAbbr.isUnique( ""cake ""); // return true, because ""cake "" is already in the dictionary and no other word in the dictionary has ""c2e "" abbreviation. **Constraints:** * `1 <= dictionary.length <= 3 * 104` * `1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 20` * `dictionary[i]` consists of lowercase English letters. * `1 <= word.length <= 20` * `word` consists of lowercase English letters. * At most `5000` calls will be made to `isUnique`.","To solve the problem, we need to implement the `ValidWordAbbr` class with the given methods. The key steps are:

1. **Initialize the dictionary**: store the words in a data structure that allows for efficient lookup, such as a `Set`.
2. **Define the remembered abbrs**: create a `Set` to store the abbrs of all words already added to the dictionary.
3. **Implement the `is unique` method**: check if the abbr of the given word is already in the remembered abbrs. If it is, return `false` if the word is not the same as the word with the same abbr. Otherwise, return `true`.

3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, return _the next state_.

    Create a new board called `result` with the same dimensions as the input board. For each cell in the input board, count the live neighbors (the 8 neighboring cells). Then apply the following rules:
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die and all other dead cells stay dead.

To count live neighbors, iterate through a predefined list of relative coordinates `dirs` representing the eight neighboring cells.

    In the Nim game, the optimal strategy is to make the other player take the last stone. The game is won by the player who can force the opponent to take the last stone. If the current number of stones is divisible by 4, the next player can always make the other player take the last stone. Therefore, whenever the current number of stones is divisible by 4, the player will lose. If the number of stones is not divisible by 4, the player can make the next player play with a number of stones divisible by 4, thus making the next player lose.

In the code, we simply check if the number of stones `n` is not divisible by 4 (`n % 4 != 0`), and if it is, then the player can win the game.

The key insight is that the player who faces a heap with a number of stones that is a multiple of 4 will always lose if both players play optimally. This is because the player can only remove 1, 2, or 3 stones, and no matter which number they choose, the opponent can always make the remaining number of stones a multiple of 4 again.

Let's break down the reasoning:

1. If `n` is a multiple of 4, the first player (you) will always lose. This is because whatever number of stones you remove (1, 2, or 3), the second player (your friend) can always remove a number of stones to make the remaining number of stones a multiple of 4 again. This process will continue until there are 4 stones left, and the second player will remove all 4 stones, winning the game.
2. If `n` is not a multiple of 4, the first player (you) can always make the remaining number of stones a multiple of 4 by removing the appropriate number of stones (1, 2, or 3). This will leave the second player (your friend) with a multiple of 4 stones, and as we saw in the previous case, the second player will lose if both players play optimally.

Therefore, the solution to the problem is to check if `n` is a multiple of 4. If it is, return `False` (you lose), otherwise return `True` (you win).

    The algorithm for solving the median in a list of integers works by maintaining two heaps, a max-heap for the left half and a min-heap for the right half. When a new number is added, it is compared to the max value of the left max-heap. If the number is smaller or equal, it is added to the left heap. If the number is larger, it is added to the right min-heap. Then, we balance the two heaps by ensuring that their sizes never differ by more than one. This ensures that the median is always easily accessible as either the largest value in the left heap or the average of the largest value in the left heap and the smallest value in the right heap. The algorithm has an O(log N) time complexity, where N is the number of elements in the list.

Here is the step-by-step implementation in Python:

1. **Initialize the Heaps:**
   - Create a Max heap to store the smaller half of the numbers.
   - Create a Min heap to store the larger half of the numbers.

   - After adding the number, ensure that the sizes of the two Heaps differ by at most 1. If they differ by more than 1, remove the root from the heap that has more elements.

3. **Find the Median:**
   - If the sizes of the two Heaps are equal, the median is the average of the roots of the two Heaps.
   - If the Max heap has more elements than the Min heap, the median is the root of the Max heap.

    The algorithm uses a Depth-First Search traversal (specifically, pre-order) to serialize the binary tree into a comma-separated string. Each empty node is represented by a ""null"" string.

To deserialize the data string back into a tree structure, the algorithm processes the comma-separated string and interprets each item it encounters. If the item is ""null"", it sets the node to null. Otherwise, it creates a TreeNode with the value and recursively sets left and right children. The deserialization also uses a pre-order traversal, which corresponds to the serialized string format. This approach ensures that the deserialized tree retains the same structure as the original tree.

We will use a string to represent the tree and then use another string to represent the deserialization.

Here is the algorithm:

1. ** Serialization:**
   - Perform a DFS on the binary tree.
   - During the DFS, if a node is null, we append "" null "" to the Serialization string.
   - If a node is not null, we append the value of the node to the Serialization string.
   - After the DFS, the Serialization string will contain the representation of the binary tree.

2. ** Deserialization:**
   - Split the Serialization string into a list of strings based on "" null "".
   - Use a recursive function to construct the binary tree from the list.
   - The recursive function will take a list of strings and an index to keep track of the current position in the list.
   - If the current string at the index is "" null "", return null.
   - If the current string at the index is not "" null "", create a new node with the value of the string and recursively construct the left and right subtrees.

    The solution is using depth-first search on the binary tree with a recursive function `longestConsecutiveSequence`. This function takes a node as input and returns the longest path of consecutive values that starts at that node. It also updates an array `longestPath` that stores the longest path seen so far, allowing multiple levels of the recursive function calls to access and update it.

For each node, the function first calls itself recursively for left and right child nodes. Then, it checks if the left and right children are consecutive values to the current value, and if so, adds the corresponding paths to `currPath`. Finally, it compares `currPath` with the maximum path found so far and updates the `longestPath` array accordingly. The longest consecutive path is returned after the recursion is complete.

    The algorithm uses a Breadth-First Search to find potential valid substrings. It first checks whether the current string is valid. If it finds a valid string, it continues to process any remaining strings in the queue, but it does not generate any more subsequences. If it has not found a valid string, it creates new substrings by removing one parentheses from the current string, adds them to the queue, and marks them as visited to avoid duplicity. This process repeats until the queue is empty or a valid string has been found. A count of open parentheses is maintained to check for string validity. The answer is returned as a list of valid strings.
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, Given a string `s` that contains parentheses and letters, remove the minimum quantity of invalid parentheses to make the input string valid. Return _a list of **unique strings** that are valid with the minimum quantity of removals_. You may return the answer in **any order**. **Example 1:** **Input:** s = ""()())() "" **Output:** \[ ""(())() "", ""()()() ""\] **Example 2:** **Input:** s = ""(a)())() "" **Output:** \[ ""(a())() "", ""(a)()() ""\] **Example 3:** **Input:** s = "")( "" **Output:** \[ "" ""\] **Constraints:** * `1 <= s.length <= 25` * `s` consists of lowercase English letters and parentheses `'('` and `')'`. * There will be at most `20` parentheses in `s`.","To solve the problem of removing the minimum number of invalid parentheses to make a string valid, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will keep track of the number of open parentheses and close parentheses as we iterate through the string. If we encounter a close parentheses before an open parentheses, it means the close parentheses is invalid and we can consider removing it. We will explore all possible combinations of removing parentheses and keep track of the valid strings we find.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define a function `is_valid(s)` to check if a string `s` is valid.**
   - Initialize two counters, `open` and `close`, to keep track of the number of open and close parentheses.
   - Iterate through the string `s`.
     - If we encounter an open parentheses, increment `open`.
     - If we encounter a close parentheses, increment `close`.
     - If `close` is greater than `open` at any point, the string is invalid.
   - After iterating through the string, if `open` is equal to `close`, the string is valid. Otherwise, it is invalid.

2. **Define a function `DFS(s, open, close, path)` to perform depth-first search.**
   - If `open` is equal to `close` and `s` is empty, we have found a valid string. Add `path` to the result list.
   - If `open` is less than `close`, we can remove a close parentheses. Recursively call `DFS` with `s` excluding the last character, `open`, `close - 1`, and `path + s[-1]`.
   - If `open` is greater than or equal to `close`, we can remove an open parentheses. Recursively call `DFS` with `s` excluding the last character, `open - 1`, `close`, and `path + s[-1]`.

3. **Define the main function `min_parentheses_removal(s)`.**
   - Initialize an empty list `result` to store the valid strings.
   - Call `DFS` with the input string `s`, initial values of `open` and `close` set to 0, and an empty `path`.
   - Return the `result` list.

Here is the Python code implementing the above approach:","python

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the prefix sum matrix:**
   - Create a new matrix `prefix_sum` with the same dimensions as `matrix`.
   - For each element in `prefix_sum`, calculate the sum of all elements in `matrix` that are above and to the left of it, including itself.

2. **Calculate the sum of the elements in the specified rectangle:**
   - To find the sum of the elements in the rectangle defined by its upper left corner `(row1, col1)` and lower right corner `(row2, col2)`, we use the following formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \text{prefix_sum[row2][col2]} - \text{prefix_sum[row1-1][col2]} - \text{prefix_sum[row2][col1-1]} + \text{prefix_sum[row1-1][col1-1]}
     \]
   - This formula works because it adds the sum of all elements in the rectangle, subtracts the sum of the elements above the rectangle, subtracts the sum of the elements to the left of the rectangle, and then adds back the sum of the elements at the top-left corner of the rectangle (which was subtracted twice).

    We will use a Union-Find data structure to keep track of the number of distinct islands. Initially, we set all the cells of the grid as water cells which are -1 in the `roots` array.

For each position in `positions`, let's consider it as a new land. We'll increment the island count at this point. If this cell was already processed as land, it is already in the same group or set of lands, so we just push the current island count as part of the result.

Next, we will check and merge the neighboring cells if they are lands. We iterate through 4 possible neighbors (up, down, left, and right) and find their root. If the root of the neighbor is different than the root of the current cell, we merge the sets and decrement island count.

Finally, we push the current island count after processing each position as part of the result.

The time complexity is O(k * log(mn)) as the Union-Find data structure has a log(n) time complexity for find and union operations.
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, You are given an empty 2D binary grid `grid` of size `m x n`. The grid represents a map where `0`'s represent water and `1`'s represent land. Initially, all the cells of `grid` are water cells (i.e., all the cells are `0`'s). We may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land. You are given an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [ri, ci]` is the position `(ri, ci)` at which we should operate the `ith` operation. Return _an array of integers_ `answer` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the quantity of islands after turning the cell_ `(ri, ci)` _into a land_. An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water. **Example 1:** **Input:** m = 3, n = 3, positions = \[\[0,0\],\[0,1\],\[1,2\],\[2,1\]\] **Output:** \[1,1,2,3\] **Explanation:** Initially, the 2d grid is filled with water. - Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid\[0\]\[0\] into a land.

Each time we add a land cell, we check if it is adjacent to any existing land cells and合并 the corresponding components if it is.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the Union Find data structure**: Create an array `root` of size `m * n` where each element points to itself. Also, create an array ` size` of size `m * n` where each element represents the size of the component (initially 1 for each cell since each cell is a separate island).

2. **Define the union function**: This function will union two components by making the root of one component point to the root of the other component and update the size of the resulting component.

3. **Define the find function**: This function will find the root of a component and path_compression to compress the tree.

4. ** Process each position in the positions array**: For each position \((r, c)\), convert it to a flat index `i` using the formula `i = r * n + c`. Then, union this cell with its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) if they are land cells (i.e., their flat indices are in the positions array).

5. **Return the result**: After processing all positions, the size of each component in the `size` array represents the number of islands after adding the corresponding land cell. Return these sizes as a list.

Here is the Python code implementing the above steps:","python

    The algorithm uses a prefix sum array to efficiently answer the range sum queries. The idea is to pre-process the input array by creating an auxiliary array prefixSum, where prefixSum[i] stores the sum of the first i elements. This allows us to compute the sum of elements in a range [left, right] in constant time, by simply returning the difference between prefixSum[right+1] and prefixSum[left]. To generate the prefixSum array, we iterate through the input array nums, and for each element, we add its value to the prefixSum array using the previous prefixSum value.

The time complexity of creating the prefixSum array is O(n) and each range sum query will take O(1) time since we just need to access and subtract two elements in the prefixSum array.

A segment tree is a binary tree where each node represents a range of the array. The root node represents the entire array, and each child node represents a sub-range of the array. This structure allows us to perform range sum queries and update values in logarithmic time.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Initialize the segment tree:**
   - The segment tree can be built in a bottom-up manner. Each non-leaf node is the sum of its two children.
   - The leaves of the tree represent the elements of the array.

2. **Update a value:**
   - To update the value at index `i` to `val`, we need to update all the nodes that represent ranges containing index `i`.
   - We start from the root and follow the path to the leaf node representing index `i`. At each node, we check if the range of the node contains index `i`. If it does, we update the value of the node to the sum of its children after updating the value of the child that represents the range containing index `i`.

3. **Calculate the sum of a range:**
   - To calculate the sum of the elements between indices `left` and `right`, we need to find the sum of the nodes that represent ranges within this range.
   - We start from the root and follow the path to the leaves. At each node, we check if the range of the node is completely within the range `left` to `right`. If it is, we add the value of the node to the sum. If it is not, we recursively check its children.

    1. When initializing the object, create a 2D table `dp` to store partial sums of the 2D array `matrix`. The dimensions of `dp` is one unit larger than the dimensions of `matrix`.
2. For each element (i, j) in `matrix`, add its value to the partial sums `dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j+1]`, subtract the overlapping sum `dp[i][j]`, and store the result at `dp[i+1][j+1]`.
3. When updating the value of a cell, calculate the difference between the new and old values, and propagate it through the remaining cells in the corresponding row and column in the `dp` table.
4. To calculate the sum within a given rectangle, use the values stored in the `dp` table as follows:
  - Add the value of the lower-right corner: `dp[row2+1][col2+1]`
  - Subtract the values of the upper-right and lower-left corners: `dp[row2+1][col1]` and `dp[row1][col2+1]`
  - Add back the value of the upper-left corner: `dp[row1][col1]`
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, Given a 2D matrix `matrix`, handle multiple queries of the following types: 1. **Update** the value of a cell in `matrix`. 2. Calculate the **sum** of the elements of `matrix` inside the rectangle defined by its **upper left corner** `(row1, col1)` and **lower right corner** `(row2, col2)`. Implement the NumMatrix class: * `NumMatrix(int[][] matrix)` Initializes the object with the integer matrix `matrix`. * `void update(int row, int col, int val)` **Updates** the value of `matrix[row][col]` to be `val`. * `int sumRegion(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2)` Returns the **sum** of the elements of `matrix` inside the rectangle defined by its **upper left corner** `(row1, col1)` and **lower right corner** `(row2, col2)`. **Example 1:** **Input** \[ ""NumMatrix "", ""sumRegion "", ""update "", ""sumRegion ""\] \[\[\[\[3, 0, 1, 4, 2\], \[5, 6, 3, 2, 1\], \[1, 2, 0, 1, 5\], \[4, 1, 0, 1, 7\], \[1, 0, 3, 0, 5\]\]\], \[2, 1, 4, 3\], \[3, 2, 2\], \[2, 1, 4, 3\]\] **Output** \[null, 8, null, 10\] **Explanation** NumMatrix numMatrix = new NumMatrix(\[\[3, 0, 1, 4, 2\], \[5, 6, 3, 2, 1\], \[1, 2, 0, 1, 5\], \[4, 1, 0, 1, 7\], \[1, 0, 3, 0, 5\]\]); numMatrix.sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3); // return 8 (i.e. sum of the left red rectangle) numMatrix.update(3, 2, 2); // matrix changes from left image to right image numMatrix.sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3); // return 10 (i.e. sum of the right red rectangle) **Constraints:** * `m == matrix.length` * `n == matrix[i].length` * `1 <= m, n <= 200` * `-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000` * `0 <= row < m` * `0 <= col < n` * `-1000 <= val <= 1000` * `0 <= row1 <= row2 < m` * `0 <= col1 <= col2 < n` * At most `5000` calls will be made to `sumRegion` and `update`.","To solve this problem, we can use a 2D prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of elements in a rectangular region and update the value of a cell. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the prefix sum array**: Create a 2D array `prefix_sum` where `prefix_sum[i][j]` represents the sum of all elements in the submatrix from `(0, 0)` to `(i, j)`. This can be computed using the formula:
   \[
   prefix_sum[i][j] = matrix[i][j] + prefix_sum[i-1][j] + prefix_sum[i][j-1] - prefix_sum[i-1][j-1]
   \]
   where `prefix_sum[-1][j] = 0` and `prefix_sum[i][-1] = 0` for all `i` and `j`.

2. **Update the matrix**: When a cell `(row, col)` is updated to a new value `val`, we need to update the prefix sum array accordingly. We do this by updating the prefix sum for all cells in the submatrix from `(0, 0)` to `(row, col)`.

3. **Calculate the sum of a rectangular region**: To find the sum of the elements in the rectangle defined by its upper left corner `(row1, col1)` and lower right corner `(row2, col2)`, we use the formula:
   \[
   sum = prefix_sum[row2][col2] - prefix_sum[row2][col1-1] - prefix_sum[row1-1][col2] + prefix_sum[row1-1][col1-1]
   \]
   where `prefix_sum[-1][j] = 0` and `prefix_sum[i][-1] = 0` for all `i` and `j`.

    ","Considering the aforementioned details, You are given `n` balloons, indexed from `0` to `n - 1`. Each balloon is painted with a quantity on it represented by an array `nums`. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If you burst the `ith` balloon, you will get `nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1]` coins. If `i - 1` or `i + 1` goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a `1` painted on it. Return _the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely_. **Example 1:** **Input:** nums = \[3,1,5,8\] **Output:** 167 **Explanation:** nums = \[3,1,5,8\] --> \[3,5,8\] --> \[3,8\] --> \[8\] --> \[\] coins = 3\*1\*5 + 3\*5\*8 + 1\*3\*8 + 1\*8\*1 = 167 **Example 2:** **Input:** nums = \[1,5\] **Output:** 10 **Constraints:** * `n == nums.length` * `1 <= n <= 300` * `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`","To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum coins we can collect by burst the balloons from index `i` to index `j`. The recurrence relation for `dp[i][j]` can be written as:

\[ dp[i][j] = \max_{i \leq k < j} (dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + nums[i-1] \cdot nums[k] \cdot nums[j+1]) \]

where `dp[i][i] = nums[i-1] \cdot nums[i] \cdot nums[i+1]` (treat `nums[-1]` and `nums[n]` as 1).

Here, we will use a binary indexed tree (Fenwick tree) to solve the problem. A binary indexed tree is a data structure that allows us to perform range sum queries and update operations in logarithmic time.
