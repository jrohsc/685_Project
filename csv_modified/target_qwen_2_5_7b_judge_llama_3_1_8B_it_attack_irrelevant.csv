    The algorithm leverages a hash map (unordered_map in C++, HashMap in Java, dictionary in Python, and Map in JavaScript). It iterates through the given 'nums' array and calculates the complementary value (target - current value). If the complementary value is already in the hash map, it means that we found a solution, and we return those indices. If the complement is not in the hash map, we store the current element in the hash map with its index. If the algorithm doesn't find the solution, it returns an empty array or throws an exception (in Java).

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively.
   - We need to find the median of the combined array of length `m + n`.

2. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - The median of a sorted array is the middle element if the array length is odd, or the average of the two middle elements if the array length is even.
   - We can use binary search to find the position of the median in the combined array.

3. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - Let's assume `m <= n` without loss of generality.
   - We need to find an index `i` such that there are `i` elements in `nums1` and `m - i` elements in `nums2` on the left side of the median.
   - The median will be either `nums1[i-1]` or `nums2[j-1]` or the average of these two elements, where `j = (m + n + 1) / 2 - i`.

4. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - Initialize two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the range of possible values for `i`.
   - Perform binary search to find the correct `i` such that the left side of the median has `i` elements.

   - Once we find the correct `i`, calculate the median based on the values at `nums1[i-1]` and `nums2[j-1]`.

If the current characters in `s` and `p` are equal or `p` has a '.', we update the `dp[i][j]` to the value `dp[i - 1][j - 1]`, because the match continues.

If the current character in `p` is '*', we have two options:

1. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as 0 occurrences. We update the `dp[i][j]` value to `dp[i][j - 2]`.
2. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as at least 1 occurrence. We update `dp[i][j]` to the value of `dp[i - 1][j] && (s[i - 1] == p[j - 2] || p[j - 2] == '.')`.

Finally, `dp[m][n]` stores the result, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of strings `s` and `p` respectively.
    ","Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where:

*   `'.'` Matches any single character.​​​​
*   `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""aa "", p =  ""a ""
**Output:** false
**Explanation:**  ""a "" does not match the entire string  ""aa "".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""aa "", p =  ""a\* ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** '\*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes  ""aa "".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  ""ab "", p =  "".\* ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**  "".\* "" means  ""zero or more (\*) of any character (.) "".

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 20`
*   `1 <= p.length <= 20`
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
*   `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'.'`, and `'*'`.
*   It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character `'*'`, there will be a previous valid character to match. John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","To solve the problem of regular expression matching with support for ` '.' ` and ` * ` in Python, we can use the built-in ` re ` module. The ` re ` module provides a powerful and flexible way to perform regular expression matching.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Import the ` re ` module.
2. Use the ` re ` module's ` match ` function to match the entire input string ` s ` with the pattern ` p `.
3. If the ` match ` function returns ` None ` or the match is not successful, return ` False `.
4. If the ` match ` function returns a match object, return ` True `.

Here is the Python code to implement the solution:","python

    pattern = re.compile(p)

    The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach, with one pointer starting from the left end and the other from the right end. It calculates the area between these two lines and updates the maximum area if the current area is larger than the previously calculated maximum area. If the height at the left pointer is less than the height at the right pointer, it moves the left pointer to the right. Otherwise, it moves the right pointer to the left. The algorithm continues until the pointers meet.

This algorithm ensures that the maximum area is found without having to check all possible pairs of lines because it always chooses the pair of lines with the maximum possible distance and minimum height difference at each step.

1. ** Initialize Pointers:**
   - Place one pointer at the beginning of the array (left) and another at the end of the array (right).

2. ** Calculate Area:**
   - The area of the container formed by the two lines and the x-axis is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{width} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - The width of the container is the distance between the two pointers, which is \( \text{right} - \text{left} \).
   - The height of the container is the minimum height of the two lines at the current positions of the pointers.

3. ** Update Pointers:**
   - Move the pointer that points to the shorter line towards the other pointer. This is because moving the pointer with the higher line would not increase the height of the container and would only decrease the width, potentially reducing the area.

4. ** Update Maximum Area:**
   - After each move, calculate the new area and update the maximum area found so far.

5. ** Repeat:**
   - Continue this process until the two pointers meet.

    1. Sort the input array `nums`.
2. Loop through `nums` from index `0` to `length - 2`. Let the current index be `i`.
    - If `i` is `0` or `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous element (`nums[i - 1]`), perform the following steps:
        - Initialize two pointers `j` and `k`, where `j` is the next index after `i`, and `k` is the last index of `nums`.
        - While `j` is less than `k`, perform the following steps:
            - Calculate the sum `s` of the elements at indices `i`, `j`, and `k`.
            - If the sum `s` is equal to `0`, then we've found a valid triplet. Add it to the `result` array and move the pointers, `j` and `k`, skipping duplicates if any.
            - If the sum `s` is less than `0`, increment `j` to move towards positive values.
            - If the sum `s` is greater than `0`, decrement `k` to move towards negative values.
3. Return the `result` array.

3. **Use two-pointers**: For each `i`, we set two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the beginning and end of the remaining part of the array (from `i+1` to the end). We then move these pointers towards each other until they meet, checking if the sum of `nums[j]` and `nums[k]` equals `-nums[i]`.
4. **Add triplets to the result**: If `nums[j] + nums[k] = -nums[i]`, we add the triplet \([nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]}\) to our result. We also need to ensure that we do not add duplicate triplets by skipping over duplicate values of `nums[j]` and `nums[k]`.

1. **Sort the array**: Sorting the array helps us to easily avoid duplicate quadruplets and to use the four-pointer approach efficiently.

2. **Use four pointers**: We will use four pointers, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, to find the quadruplets. We start with `a` at the beginning of the array, `b` at `a+1`, `c` at `b+1`, and `d` at `c+1`. We then move these pointers based on the sum of the elements they point to.

3. **Check the sum**: If the sum of the elements at the four pointers is equal to the target, we add the quadruplet to our result list. If the sum is less than the target, we move `d` to the right to increase the sum. If the sum is greater than the target, we move `c` to the right to decrease the sum.

    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

        second = second.next
    
    second.next = second.next.next
    
    return head
```
    
    The algorithm uses two pointers, first and second. The first pointer traverses the list, moving n steps ahead of the second pointer. If the first pointer reaches the end of the list, then the head is updated, and the second pointer becomes the new head. Otherwise, the second pointer is moved along with the first pointer until the first pointer is one position before the last item. Then, the nth node from the end of the list is skipped by updating the next pointer of the second pointer. Finally, the head of the updated list is returned.
    ","Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `nth` node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[1,2,3,4,5\], n = 2
**Output:** \[1,2,3,5\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[1\], n = 1
**Output:** \[\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[1,2\], n = 1
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
*   `1 <= sz <= 30`
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   `1 <= n <= sz`

**Follow up:** Could you do this in one pass? Additionally, the sky was clear that day.","To solve the problem of removing the `nth` node from the end of a linked list in Python, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: Create two pointers, `first` and `second`, both starting at the head of the list.
2. **Move the First Pointers**: Move the `first` pointer `n` steps forward. This ensures that when the `second` pointer reaches the end of the list, the `first` pointer is at the `n`th node from the end.
3. **Move the Second Pointers**: Move both the `first` and `second` pointers together until the `second` pointer reaches the end of the list. This means the `first` pointer will be at the `n`th node from the end.
4. **Remove the Node**: Once the `second` pointer reaches the end, remove the node pointed to by the `first` pointer.
5. **Return the Head**: Return the head of the list.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:","python
def removeNthFromEnd(head, n):
    # Initialize two pointers
    first = head
    second = head

    # Move the first pointer n steps forward
    for _ in range(n):
        first = first.next

    # Move both pointectors together until the second pointer reaches the end
    while second.next!= None:
        second = second.next
        first = first.next

    # Remove the node pointed to by the first pointer
    first.next = None

    # Return the head of the list
    return head","**Correctness:** correct

```
    
    The algorithm uses a stack data structure to check the validity of the input string. It iterates through the string one character at a time. When an open bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. When a close bracket is encountered, the algorithm checks if the stack is empty or the corresponding open bracket is not at the top of the stack. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns false. If not, the open bracket is popped from the stack. After iterating through the entire string, the function checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is not empty, the function returns false, indicating there were unmatched open braces. Otherwise, the function returns true, indicating that the string is valid.

    The algorithm uses a helper function called `generateParenthesisHelper` which receives four parameters: the number of open parentheses left to place, the number of close parentheses left to place, the current string that holds the generated parentheses so far, and the result list to store valid combinations.

The algorithm uses a depth-first search to construct valid combinations of parentheses. It starts with `n` open parentheses and increments the number of close parentheses as it places an open parenthesis. When the helper function has no open or close parentheses left to place, it means a valid combination is found, so it adds the combination to the result list.

The helper function recursively calls itself. If there are open parentheses left to place, it calls itself with one less open parenthesis and one more close parenthesis. If there are close parentheses left to place, it calls itself without changing the number of open parentheses and with one less close parenthesis. Finally, the current string in each case is updated with the placed open or close parenthesis.

1. If the given array of linked-lists is empty, we return a null pointer.
2. The main function `mergeKLists` merges the first two lists in the array of linked-lists and appends the results (merged list) at the end of the array. It will then remove the merged lists from the beginning of the array. This process is repeated until only one linked-list remains in the array.
3. The function `merge2Lists` is used for merging two sorted linked-lists. The smallest element of the two lists is chosen as the head node and recursively merged with the rest of the lists.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize a min-heap**: We will use a min-heap to store the smallest elements from each list. The heap will be implemented using a list where the ` heappush` and `heappop` operations are used to add and remove the smallest element, respectively.

2. **Add the first elements of each list to the heap**: Iterate through each list and add the first element of the list to the heap. If the list is empty, do not add anything.

3. **Merge the lists**: While the heap is not empty, do the following:
   - Pop the smallest element from the heap.
   - Add this element to the result list.
   - If there is a next element in the list from which the smallest element was taken, add it to the heap.

3. **Update Pointers**: If the element at position `i` is different from the element at position `j-1`, it means we have found a new unique element. In this case, we move the pointer `j` to the right and place the element at position `i` at position `j`.

4. **Return the Number of Unique Elements**: After iterating through the entire array, the value of `j` will be the number of unique elements in the array. We return `j`.

    The algorithm uses two pointers approach. The pointer `i` maintains the position where the next non-val element should be placed, and pointer `j` iterates through the array.

The `i` pointer will give us the count of elements that are not equal to `val`, which is the result. Thus, we return the value of `i` as the final result.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, as we only iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) since we do not use any extra memory. We modify the input array in-place.

    1. If the input string `s` or `words` array is empty, return an empty list.
2. Create a hashmap `word_count` to store the count of each word present in the `words` array.
3. Get the length of a single word, the total number of words, and the total length of the concatenated string.
4. Iterate through the string `s` with an index `i`, starting from 0 and up to `s.size() - total_length`.
5. For each index `i`, create a temporary hashmap `temp_word_count`, and iterate through the words starting from index `j` to `total_words - 1`.
6. Extract the current word from the substring with the starting position `(i + j * word_length)`, and length `word_length`.
7. Look for the current word in the hashmap `word_count`. If it's not present, break the loop and check the next index.
8. Add the current word to the temporary hashmap `temp_word_count`. If the word's count in `temp_word_count` exceeds the count in `word_count`, break the loop.
9. If all words are present in the substring and satisfy the required counts, add the current index `i` to the result list.
10. Return the result list after processing all indices.
    ","You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of `words` are of **the same length**.

A **concatenated substring** in `s` is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of `words` concatenated.

*   For example, if `words = [ ""ab "", ""cd "", ""ef ""]`, then `""abcdef ""`, `""abefcd ""`, `""cdabef ""`, `""cdefab ""`, `""efabcd ""`, and `""efcdab ""` are all concatenated strings. `""acdbef ""` is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of `words`.

Return _the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in_ `s`. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""barfoothefoobarman "", words = \[ ""foo "", ""bar ""\]
**Output:** \[0,9\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 2 and words\[i\].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.
The substring starting at 0 is  ""barfoo "". It is the concatenation of \[ ""bar "", ""foo ""\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is  ""foobar "". It is the concatenation of \[ ""foo "", ""bar ""\] which is a permutation of words.
The output order does not matter. Returning \[9,0\] is fine too.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""wordgoodgoodgoodbestword "", words = \[ ""word "", ""good "", ""best "", ""word ""\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 4 and words\[i\].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.
There is no substring of length 16 is s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.

Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","To solve the problem of finding all starting indices of concatenated substrings in a given string `s` using an array of strings `words`, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of the concatenated substring:**
   Since all strings in `words` are of the same length, let `word_length` be the length of each word. The length of the concatenated substring will be `word_length * words_length`.

2. **Create a rolling hash for the concatenated substring:**
   We will use a rolling hash to efficiently compare the hash value of each substring of length `word_length * words_length` with the hash value of the concatenated string of `words`.

3. **Calculate the hash value of the concatenated string:**
   Compute the hash value of the concatenated string of `words` using the rolling hash formula.

4. **Iterate through the string `s$:**
   Iterate through `s` and calculate the hash value of each substring of length `word_length * words_length`. Compare this hash value with the hash value of the concatenated string. If they are equal, the starting index of the substring is a valid starting index of a concatenated substring.

5. **Return the starting indices:**
   Collect all the starting indices where the hash values match and return them.

The key idea is to determine which half of the array is sorted and then apply binary search on that half.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the pivot index**: The pivot index `k` is the index where the array is rotated. We can find `k` by comparing the first and last elements of the array. If the first element is greater than the last element, then the array is rotated at some index `k` such that `k > 0`. Otherwise, the array is not rotated (i.e., `k = 0`).

2. **Determine the sorted half**: Once we have identified the pivot index `k`, we can determine which half of the array is sorted. If `k > 0`, then the subarray from `k` to `n-1` is sorted, and the subarray from `0` to `k-1` is sorted. If `k = 0`, then the entire array is sorted.

3. **Apply binary search**: We can apply binary search on the sorted half of the array to find the index of the target value. If the target value is found, we return its index. If the target value is not found, we return `-1`.

    The given problem requires a binary search algorithm. We define two pointers, `left` and `right`, initially set to the first and last index of the array. We then enter a loop that continues as long as left is less than or equal to right. Inside the loop, we calculate the middle index, `mid`, as the average of left and right. If the value at this middle index is equal to the target value, we return the middle index. If the middle value is less than the target value, we set left to `mid + 1`, meaning we search the right half of the remaining array. If the middle value is greater than the target value, we set the right to `mid - 1`, meaning we search the left half of the remaining array. After the loop, if the target value is not found, we return the value of the left pointer, which represents the index where the target value should be inserted.

Binary search is an efficient algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the target is less than the middle element, the search interval is reduced to the left half. If the value of the target is greater than the middle element, the search interval is reduced to the right half. This process continues until the target value is found or the search interval is reduced to a single element.

2. Once an empty cell is found, it tries to insert a number from 1 to 9.
3. For each inserted number, it checks if its placement is valid based on Sudoku rules:
   - The number must not be present in the same row or column.
   - The number must not be present in its corresponding 3x3 grid.
4. It calls itself (backtracks) recursively whenever a valid number is inserted into the cell.
5. If inserting a number fails to lead to a valid solution, the algorithm reverts that cell to '.' and tries the next number.
6. The process is repeated until a valid board is created or all possibilities have failed.
7. Once an empty cell is not found, it considers the board solved and exits the process.
    ","Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy **all of the following rules**:

1.  Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each row.
2.  Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each column.
3.  Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid.

The `'.'` character indicates empty cells.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[ ""5 "", ""3 "", "". "", "". "", ""7 "", "". "", "". "", "". "", "". ""\],\[ ""6 "", "". "", "". "", ""1 "", ""9 "", ""5 "", "". "", "". "", "". ""\],\[ "".

**Explanation:** The input board is shown above and the only valid solution is shown below:

 

**Constraints:**

*   `board.length == 9`
*   `board[i].length == 9`
*   `board[i][j]` is a digit or `'.'`.
*   It is **guaranteed** that the input board has only one solution. John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","To solve the Sudoku puzzle, we can use a backtracking algorithm. The algorithm works by iterating through each cell in the grid and trying to fill it with a digit from 1 to 9. If a digit can be placed in a cell without violating the Sudoku rules, the algorithm moves to the next cell. If a digit cannot be placed in a cell, the algorithm backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different digit.

    The algorithm is a recursive backtracking algorithm. We define a helper function `findCombinations` that takes the following parameters:

1. `startIndex`: the index of the candidates array from which it can start choosing numbers.
2. `remaining`: the remaining sum needed to reach the target.

The base cases are:
- If `remaining` is 0, it means we have found a valid combination, so we return a list containing an empty list.
- If `startIndex` is equal to the length of candidates, or `remaining` is negative, there are no valid combinations, so we return an empty list.

In the function, we first initialize an empty list called `result`. Then, we make two recursive calls to `findCombinations`:

1. Excluding the current candidate at `startIndex` and incrementing `startIndex`, to search for combinations without this candidate.
2. Including the current candidate in the combination, and decreasing `remaining` accordingly (without updating `startIndex`).

After getting results from both recursive calls, we merge them and return the final list of combinations.

The main function `combinationSum` calls `findCombinations` with `startIndex` as 0 and `remaining` as the target, and returns the result after the recursion is done.

1. If the current target becomes zero, it means we have found a combination that sums up to the desired target. Add the current combination to the result list and return.
2. Iterate through the `candidates` list starting from the given index.
   - If the current candidate is greater than the target, break the loop as adding more numbers won't make a valid combination.
   - Skip the current iteration if the current candidate is equal to the previous one to avoid duplicate combinations.
   - Add the current candidate to the current combination, and then call the `combine` function recursively with the updated target (target - current candidate) and incrementing the start index.
   - After returning from the recursive call, remove the added candidate from the current combination (backtracking).

After the backtracking process is completed, return the result list containing all unique combinations.

   - Iterate through the array from index 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each element `nums[i]` in the array, if `nums[i]` is a positive integer and `nums[i] <= n`, mark the presence of `nums[i]` by setting `nums[i]` to `n + 1` (this effectively marks the presence of `nums[i]` without using extra space).

   - Iterate through the array from index 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each element `nums[i]` in the array, if `nums[i]` is still less than or equal to `n`, then `i + 1` is a positive integer that is missing from the array.

    The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach, initializing left and right pointers to the beginning and end of the elevation map, respectively. It also initializes two variables `maxLeft` and `maxRight` to keep track of the maximum heights on the left and right of the pointers, as well as a variable `water` to store the trapped water.

The algorithm iterates through the elevation map until the left pointer is less than the right pointer. In each iteration, it compares the values at both pointers to determine which side is shorter. If the value at the left pointer is less than or equal to the value at the right pointer, it means water can be trapped on the left side up to the height of the shorter bar. The algorithm updates `maxLeft` with the maximum height on the left side and then adds the trapped water (which is the difference between the maximum height and the current height) to the `water` variable. The left pointer is then incremented. If the value at the right pointer is smaller, the same logic is applied to the right side and the right pointer is decremented.

This process is repeated until the left pointer is no longer less than the right pointer, at which point the total trapped water has been calculated and the `water` variable is returned. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) as it only uses constant extra space.

    c. Swap the elements back to their original positions.

This will generate all possible permutations, as it swaps elements in different positions while maintaining the original order in the input array. The termination condition for the recursion is the base case when we reach the end of the array. The complexity of this algorithm is O(N!), as there are N! permutations of an array of N elements.

    We use backtracking to generate permutations. Firstly, we sort the `nums` array to make sure that duplicate numbers are located together. Then, for each recursive backtracking call, we swap the elements in the range `[start, len(nums) - 1]` with `nums[start]`, ignoring already-visited elements by using a `visited` array.

We also skip any element that is equal to the current `start` element to avoid duplicates. After generating a valid permutation by iterating through all indices, we append the current permutation to the result array. When backtracking, we maintain the original order of elements before moving to the next level.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n! * n) since there are n! available permutations and each permutation requires O(n) time to build the solution. The space complexity is O(n) to store the `visited` array and temporary lists.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log(n)) because the loop iterates through the bits of n, and the number of bits in n is proportional to the logarithm of n. The space complexity is O(1), as the space used by the temporary variables does not depend on the size of n.

When placing a queen, check if that position is safe from all previously placed queens in terms of the horizontal, diagonal, and anti-diagonal directions. If the selected position is safe, move on to the next column and try to place another queen there.

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, incrementally building candidates to the solutions and **abstaining** a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be extended to a valid solution.

Here is the step-by-step solution to the **n-queens** puzzle in Python:

1. **Define the Problem:**
   - We need to place `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
   - A queen can attack any piece that is on the same row, column, or diagonal.

2. **Set Up the棋board:**
   - Represent the chessboard as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row.
   - Use `0` to represent an empty space and `1` to represent a queen.

3. **Backtracking Function:**
   - Start with an empty chessboard.
   - Try to place a queen in each column, one by one.
   - For each column, check if it is safe to place a queen in a particular row.
   - If it is safe, place the queen and move to the next column.
   - If it is not safe, backtrack and try the next row in the current column.
   - If all queens are placed successfully, add the chessboard configuration to the list of solutions.

4. ** implementing the Backtracking Function:**
   - Use a recursive function to implement the backtracking algorithm.
   - Use a list to keep track of the current state of the chessboard.
   - Use a set to keep track of the rows and diagonals that are already occupied.

5. **Base Case:**
   - If all `n` queens are placed successfully, add the chessboard configuration to the list of solutions.

6. **Recursive Case:**
   - For each column, try to place a queen in each row.
   - Check if it is safe to place the queen in the current row.
   - If it is safe, place the queen and move to the next column.
   - If it is not safe, backtrack and try the next row in the current column.

7. **Check Safety:**
   - To check if it is safe to place a queen in a particular row, check if the row, the left diagonal, and the right diagonal are already occupied.
   - Use a set to keep track of the rows and diagonals that are already occupied.

8. **Final Solution:**
   - After the backtracking function returns, the list of solutions will contain all distinct solutions to the **n-queens** puzzle.

    The algorithm recursively places queens on columns and checks if the placement is safe, i.e., no queens are attacking each other. 
1. Maintain an array `cols` storing the row indices of placed queens. The index in this array represents the column the queen is placed in. This ensures that no two queens are placed in the same column.
2. Recursively place queens (column-wise).
3. Check for a safe position for each queen in the current column:
   a. Check for same row (`cols[i] == row`).
   b. Check for diagonal attack (`abs(i - col) == abs(cols[i] - row)`).
4. If the current position is safe, place the queen in the current column at the current row position, and continue to place the next queen.
5. If all queens are placed, increment the solution count.
6. If the recursive call finishes, backtrack by removing the queen from the current column and move on to the next row in the same column.
7. The base case is when the `cols` size equals `n`, meaning all queens have been placed safely; increment the count.

This approach considers all possible configurations for placing the n queens while avoiding visiting invalid configurations. It uses backtracking to explore the state space efficiently. The algorithm finds the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

1. **Define the Problem:**
   We need to place `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

2. **Backtracking Function:**
   We will use a recursive function to place the queens one by one in different columns. For each column, we check if we can place a queen in any row without it being attacked by any previously placed queens. If we can, we place the queen and move to the next column. If we can't, we backtrack and try the next row in the current column.

3. **Count Solutions:**
   We will keep a count of the number of valid solutions found.

This helps us to decide whether to continue the current contiguous subarray or start a new one from that element.

This algorithm runs in linear time, \(O(n)\), and uses a single pass through the array.

Here's the step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. Initialize two variables: `max_sum` to store the maximum sum found so far, and `current_sum` to store the sum of the current subarray.
2. Iterate through each element in the array.
3. For each element, add it to the `current_sum`.
4. If the `current_sum` becomes negative, reset it to zero because a negative sum would not contribute to a maximum sum subarray.
5. If the `current_sum` is greater than the `max_sum`, update the `max_sum` with the value of `current_sum`.
6. After iterating through all elements, the `max_sum` will contain the sum of the subarray with the largest sum.

    The algorithm to merge the new interval starts by exploring the non-overlapping intervals before the new one as we are given a sorted list of intervals. We add the explored intervals that came before to the result. After that, we continue exploring intervals that overlap with the new interval and continuously merging them. We update the new interval's starting and ending points according to the merging process until no overlapping intervals remain. We add the merged interval to the result list, and finally, we add the rest of the original intervals present after the new interval. The result will be a merged list of intervals. 
    ","You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the `ith` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` _after the insertion_.

The robot needs to make exactly `m-1` moves down and `n-1` moves right to reach the bottom-right corner. The total number of moves is therefore `m-1 + n-1 = m+n-2`. The number of unique paths is the number of ways to arrange these `m-1` down moves and `n-1` right moves in a sequence of `m+n-2` moves. This is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}\) (or equivalently \(\binom{m+n-2}{n-1}\)).

The binomial coefficient \(\binom{m+n-2}{m-1}\) is calculated as:
\[
\binom{m+n-2}{m-1} = \frac{(m+n-2)!}{(m-1)!(n-1)!}

The idea is to create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to reach the cell `(i, j)` from the starting cell `(0, 0)`. We can fill this array iteratively by considering the possible moves (right or down) and checking if the current cell is an obstacle.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `m x n` with all elements set to 0.
2. Set `dp[0][0]` to 1 because there is exactly one way to be at the starting cell.
3. Iterate over each cell in the grid. For each cell `(i, j)`, if it is not an obstacle, the number of ways to reach it is the sum of the number of ways to reach the cell above it (`dp[i-1][j]`) and the cell to the left of it (`dp[i][j-1]`).

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

2. Set `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 2` as the base cases.

   - When we encounter a double period `'..'`, we remove the current directory and go up a level.

2. Initialize `left` and `right` pointers, `valid` counter for keeping track of characters satisfying the criteria, and `start` and `length` for holding the answer substring information.
3. Iterate through the string `s` using the `right` pointer, and:
    - If the current character exists in the `need` map, update the count of the character in the `window` map, and increment `valid` if the count in the window is less than or equal to the count in need.
4. Check the validity by comparing `valid` with the length of `t`.
    - If valid, update the answer substring's `start` and `length` if the current window's length is less than the current minimum.
    - Then, increment the `left` pointer to slide the window until the current character count in the window goes below the count in `need`. Update the `valid` counter accordingly.

**Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the dictionary for `t`**:
   - Create a dictionary `t_dict` to store the frequency of each character in `t`.

2. **Initialize the two pointers**:
   - Set `left` and `right` to 0. These will be the left and right boundaries of the current window in `s`.

3. **Initialize variables to store the minimum window**:
   - Set `min_length` to a large number (e.g., `m + 1`).
   - Set `min_window` to an empty string.

4. **Iterate over the characters in `s`**:
   - Use a while loop to move the `right` pointer from 0 to `m`.
   - For each character `s[right]` in `s`, update its frequency in a dictionary `s_dict`.
   - Check if the current window contains all characters of `t`:
     - Create a new dictionary ` window_dict` to store the frequency of characters in the current window.
     - Iterate over the keys in `t_dict` and check if each key is in `s_dict` and its frequency in `s_dict` is at least as much as its frequency in `t_dict`.
     - If all keys are present and their frequencies are sufficient, update `min_length` and `min_window` if the current window is smaller than the current `min_length`.

5. **Move the `left` pointer**:
   - If the current window contains all characters of `t`, move the `left` pointer to the right until the window no longer contains all characters of `t` or `left` reaches `right`.

6. **Return the minimum window**:
   - After the loop, if `min_length` is still a large number, return an empty string. Otherwise, return `min_window`.

Additionally, the sky was clear that day.","To solve the problem of removing duplicates from the array `nums` such that each unique element appears at most twice and the relative order of the elements is preserved, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: We start with two pointers, `i` and `j`, where `i` is the slow pointer and `j` is the fast pointer. Initially, both pointers are at the beginning of the array.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**: We iterate through the array using the fast pointer `j`. For each element at position `j`, we check if it is the same as the element at position `i` or `i-1` (if `i` is greater than 0).

3. **  rite Elements**: If the element at position `j` is different from the element at position `i` or `i-1`, it means it is a new unique element or a second occurrence of an existing unique element. In this case, we move the slow pointer `i` to the next position and set the element at position `i` to the element at position `j`.

4. **Continue Iterating**: We continue this process until the fast pointer `j` reaches the end of the array.

5. **Return the Result**: After the loop, the slow pointer `i` will be at the position where the last valid element is located. The value of `i` is the number of elements in the array after removing the duplicates.

    The algorithm is based on a modified binary search. We start by setting two pointers named `left` and `right` at the first and last element of the array, respectively. We then enter a loop, which continues until the `left` pointer is less than or equal to the `right` pointer.

Inside the loop, we first calculate the middle index `mid` using the `left` and `right` pointers. If the middle element of the array is equal to the target, we return true, indicating that the target is found.

If the middle element is equal to the left element, we increment the `left` pointer. If the middle element is greater than the left element, we check if the target is within the left and middle elements. If it is, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one. Otherwise, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one.

If the middle element is still smaller than the left element, we then check if the target is within the middle and right elements. If it is, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one. Otherwise, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one.

After the loop, we return false if the target is not found in the array.

    The algorithm uses a dummy node to simplify the handling of the head node of the linked list. We declare two pointers: `prev` and `curr` which are pointers to the previous and current nodes, respectively. 

The algorithm iterates through the list with the current pointer. If the current node's value is equal to the next node's value, we continue moving the current pointer along the duplicate values. Once we reach the end of duplicates, we check if the previous node's next pointer is pointing to the current node. If it is, it means there were no duplicates (prev and curr are consecutive), so we move the `prev` pointer to the current node. Otherwise, we set `prev.next` to `curr.next` to skip the duplicates. 

Finally, we move the current pointer to the next node, and repeat the process. The resulting list will have all duplicates removed, and the changes will persist as the dummy node is used to reference the head of the modified list.

We do this by iterating through each column `j` and calculating the area of the rectangle with height `dp[i][j]` and width `j - left + 1`, where `left` is the leftmost column with a height greater than or equal to `dp[i][j]`.

   - If the value of the node is less than `x`, move the `left` pointer to the right and swap the values of the nodes at the `left` and `right` pointers.
   - If the value of the node is greater than or equal to `x`, move the `right` pointer to the right.

3. **Stop When `right` reach the End**: Once the `right` pointer reaches the end of the list, stop the iteration.

4. **Set the Partition**: After the iteration, all nodes to the left of the `left` pointer will be less than `x`, and all nodes to the right of the `left` pointer will be greater than or equal to `x`. Set the next node after the `left` pointer as the new head of the list.

   - For each possible split index `i` (where `1 <= i < length(s1)`), split `s1` into `x = s1[:i]` and `y = s1[i:]`.

    The algorithm first sorts the given array, and then it generates all possible subsets. For each subset, it checks if it already exists in the result set. If not, it adds the subset to the result set.

The algorithm uses a backtracking approach. It starts with an empty subset and iteratively adds elements from the input array to the subset. It keeps track of the starting index to avoid creating duplicate subsets.

In the C++ and Java implementations, a `set` data structure is used to store unique subsets. In the Python implementation, Python's `set` is used along with itertools' `combinations` function to achieve the same result. In the JavaScript implementation, a `Set` object is used, but as it doesn't handle array comparisons properly, each subset is converted into a JSON string to compare the string representation of subsets.

At the end, the function returns the result set, converted into the desired format (list of lists or vector of vectors).

- `dp[1] = 1` if `s[0]` is not '0', because there is exactly one way to decode a single character (itself).

1. The last character `s[i-1]` is a valid single-digit number (i.e., `s[i-1]` is between '1' and '9'). In this case, we can decode the last character independently, so `dp[i] += dp[i-1]`.
2. The last two characters `s[i-2]` and `s[i-1]` form a valid two-digit number (i.e., `s[i-2]` is between '1' and '9' and `s[i-1]` is between '0' and '9', and the two-digit number formed by `s[i-2]` and `s[i-1]` is between 10 and 26).

We then call the dfs function recursively, with the current index incremented by one, the current IP appended with the current character and a dot, and incrementing part by 1. If the current number is 0 (which indicates a leading zero), we also break the iteration.

3. **Recursive case**: If the current index is not equal to the length of the string, we consider two possibilities:
   - Insert a dot at the current index.
   - Continue without inserting a dot.

4. **Inserting a dot**: If we insert a dot, we recursively call the function with the next index and add the current segment of the string (from the current index to the next dot or the end of the string) to the current segment.

5. **Continuing without inserting a dot**: If we do not insert a dot, we recursively call the function with the next index and add the current segment of the string (from the current index to the next dot or the end of the string) to the current segment.

6. **Validating the segments**: To ensure that each segment is a valid integer between 0 and 255, we check the range of the segment before adding it to the current segment.

1. Initialize the dimensions of the `dp` array based on the lengths of `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`.
2. Set `dp[0][0]` to true since an empty string is an empty interleaving.
3. Fill in the first row and first column of the `dp` array. If the first character of `s1` matches the first character of `s3`, then `dp[1][j]` is true for all `j` up to the length of `s2`. Similarly, if the first character of `s2` matches the first character of `s3`, then `dp[i][1]` is true for all `i` up to the length of `s1`.
4. For the rest of the `dp` array, fill in each cell `dp[i][j]` based on the following conditions:
   - If the `i`-th character of `s1` matches the `i+j`-th character of `s3`, then `dp[i][j]` is true if `dp[i-1][j]` is true.
   - If the `j`-th character of `s2` matches the `i+j`-th character of `s3`, then `dp[i][j]` is true if `dp[i][j-1]` is true.

    The algorithm follows a simple recursive approach to determine if a given binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST). The key idea is to maintain a range for each node, which is defined by the minimum and maximum values that the node's value should be within. For example, the root node's value should be in the range of (-Infinity, Infinity). When traversing to the left child, the maximum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value, and for traversing to the right child, the minimum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value. The algorithm continues recursively in this manner.

A helper function, `isValidBSTHelper`, is defined and initialized with the root and the range (-Infinity, Infinity). If the node is `null`, it means that we have reached a leaf node and it should return `true`. If the value of the node is not within the specified range, it means that the node does not meet the BST requirement and the helper function should return `false`. If the node is valid, then the helper function proceeds to check for valid BSTs in its left and right subtrees with the updated range.

It will compare the nodes at each level of the tree, and return false if the nodes have different values or if one node is missing in one of the trees. The algorithm will only return true if all nodes in both trees are the same.

At each level, the function checks if both nodes are null, indicating we've reached the end of both trees and they must be the same. Then it checks if either node is null, indicating that one tree is missing a node and they cannot be the same. If both nodes have the same value, we then recursively check their left and right children. If both children are the same, the function returns true.

The function then checks whether the values of both nodes are equal and continues to call itself recursively, but with the arguments changed to evaluate the left subtree and right subtree symmetrically. If the left and right subtrees have symmetric nodes, the function will return true; otherwise, it will return false.

The recursive calls in the helper function flip the direction of traversal for both subtrees to ensure that the subtrees are compared symmetrically. In each recursive call, the appropriate child nodes are visited in opposite directions to make sure they can be properly compared.

    The algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) on both the preorder and inorder traversal results. This algorithm iteratively breaks the inorder sequence into left and right subtrees using the preorder array. The basic idea is that the first element of preorder traversal will always be the root of the tree. Then, we can find that root node's index in the inorder traversal, and create the left subtree from the elements to the left of the index, and the right subtree from the elements to the right of the index. Then we continue this process recursively.

To improve the performance of the search for the index, we can use a map (in C++, Java and JavaScript) or a dictionary (in Python) to store the indices of all elements in the inorder traversal. This way, we don't need to traverse the inorder array every time to find the index of the current element.

Since we're doing this for Python, Java, C++ and JavaScript, some data structures might look a bit different and have different functions to do the same action, but the algorithm used in all languages is the same.

- Preorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- Inorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- A map is used to store the indices for inorder traversal in C++, Java, and JavaScript, while a dictionary is used in Python.
- A helper function is used to recursively construct the tree.
- For Python and JavaScript, the scope of pre_idx is made non-local, so it does not require additional arguments.

    We are given the inorder and postorder traversals of a binary tree, and the task is to reconstruct the binary tree from this information. In the postorder traversal, the last element is the root of the tree. Knowing the root, we can divide the inorder traversal into left and right subtrees. With the knowledge of the left subtree size, we can divide the postorder traversal into left and right subtrees as well. We can then recursively build the left and right subtrees, and construct the tree accordingly.

The provided solution maintains a hashmap to keep the indexes of elements in the inorder traversal for easy access during the construction. It uses a helper function `_build` to carry out the recursive construction. The `_build` function takes in the range of elements to be considered in both inorder and postorder traversals and recursively constructs the tree, by dividing the inorder and postorder ranges into left and right subtrees, using the root found in the postorder traversal.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize a queue**: We will use a queue to perform the BFS. However, since we need to start from the bottom, we will use a stack to keep track of the nodes in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) order.

   - Pop a node from the stack.
   - Add the values of the left and right children of the popped node to the stack (if they exist).

    left = minDepth(root.left)
    right = minDepth(root.right)
    return (left == 0 or right == 0) and left + right + 1 or min(left, right) + 1
```
    
    We perform a depth-first search on the tree. The base case would be an empty tree with a depth of 0.

For each non-null subtree, we recursively find the minimum depth of the left and right children. Then, we have three cases:
1. If both left and right children are null, then the current node is a leaf node, and the minimum depth is 1.
2. If either left or right child is null, we return the depth of the other child + 1.
3. If both children are non-null, we take the minimum depth of both children and add 1.

To handle all the cases in a single line, we use a ternary conditional expression in C++, Java, and JavaScript, and use the `and`-`or` short-circuit syntax in Python. We check if either left or right is 0, and in that case return left + right + 1 which handles cases 1 and 2; otherwise, we return the minimum depth of both children + 1, which handles case 3.

3. **Discounting the Current Value**: For each node, we add its value to the current path and update the current sum. Then we recursively call the function on the left and right children.

Let's define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of distinct subsequences of the first `i` characters of `s` that equal the first `j` characters of `t`.

    The algorithm to populate the next pointers is a simple modification of the pre-order traversal of the binary tree. We start with the root, and for each node, we check if it has left and right children. If so, we set the left child's next pointer to point to the right child. If the current node's next pointer is not null, we set its right child's next pointer to the left child of its next node. Finally, we recursively call the function on the left and right children.

    The basic idea of the algorithm is to perform level-order traversal (Breadth First Search) on the binary tree. We use a queue to store the nodes in each level. For each level, we iterate through its nodes, update the `next` pointer, and add their children to the end of the queue. The `prev` variable holds the previous node in the current level. The `next` pointer of the `prev` node is updated to the current node. The variable `prev` is then set to the current node. Repeat this process until the queue is empty which means we have visited all the nodes in the tree.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize variables:**
   - `max_profit`: This variable will store the maximum profit we can achieve. We start with a profit of 0.
   - `min_price`: This variable will store the minimum price we have seen so far. We start with a minimum price of infinity (or a very large number).

2. ** Iterate through the array:**
   - For each day `i` in the array `prices`, we do the following:
     - Calculate the profit we would get if we sell the stock on day `i` after buying it on the day we have seen so far (i.e., `prices[i] - min_price`).
     - Update the `max_profit` if the profit we get from selling on day `i` is greater than the current `max_profit`.
     - Update the `min_price` if the price on day `i` is less than the current `min_price`.

3. ** Return the maximum profit:**
   - After iterating through the entire array, the `max_profit` variable will contain the maximum profit we can achieve.

We will keep track of the maximum profit we can achieve after each day, considering the constraints of the problem.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit we can achieve after `i` days with `j` transactions.
   - We need to consider three states: `j = 0` (no transactions), `j = 1` (one transaction), and `j = 2` (two transactions).

2. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[i][0] = 0` for all `i` because with no transactions, the profit is 0.
   - `dp[0][1] = 0` because we cannot make a transaction on the first day.
   - `dp[0][2] = 0` because we cannot make two transactions on the first day.

3. **Transition Rules:**
   - For `j = 1` (one transaction):
     - We can either do nothing or buy on the current day.
     - If we do nothing, `dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][1]`.
     - If we buy on the current day, `dp[i][1] = max(dp[i][1], -price[i])`.
   - For `j = 2` (two transactions):
     - We can either do nothing, buy on the current day, or sell on the current day.
     - If we do nothing, `dp[i][2] = dp[i-1][2]`.
     - If we buy on the current day, `dp[i][2] = max(dp[i][2], dp[i-1][1] - price[i])`.
     - If we sell on the current day, `dp[i][2] = max(dp[i][2], dp[i-1][2] + price[i])`.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The maximum profit we can achieve after `n` days with at most two transactions is `dp[n][2]`.

Let's implement this in Python:","python

**Output:** \[\[ ""hit "", ""hot "", ""dot "", ""dog "", ""cog ""\],\[ ""hit "", ""hot "", ""lot "", ""log "", ""cog ""\]\]
**Explanation:** There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
 ""hit "" ->  ""hot "" ->  ""dot "" ->  ""dog "" ->  ""cog ""
 ""hit "" ->  ""hot "" ->  ""lot "" ->  ""log "" ->  ""cog ""

**Example 2:**

*   All the words in `wordList` are **unique**.
*   The **sum** of all shortest transformation sequences does not exceed `105`. Additionally, the sky was clear that day.","To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find all the shortest transformation sequences from `begin word` to `end word` using the given `wordList`. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize the BFS queue**: Start with the `begin word` and an empty path. Also, create a set to keep track of visited words to avoid processing the same word multiple times.

2. **Define the BFS function**: In each iteration of the BFS, dequeue a word and its path. For each word, generate all possible words by changing one letter at a time. If the generated word is in the `wordList` and has not been visited, enqueue it along with the updated path.

3. **Check for the end word**: If the end word is dequeued, it means we have found a transformation sequence. Add this sequence to the result list.

4. **Continue the BFS until the queue is empty**: Repeat the process until the queue is empty. If the end word is not found, return an empty list.

Now we iterate through the original array of numbers, and for each number, we check if `(number - 1)` is not in the `elements` set. If it's not in the set, it means we can start counting a new consecutive sequence.
Next, we create two variables, `currentNum` and `currentSeq`, and initialize them with the current number and 1, respectively.
We then use a while loop to check if the next number (`currentNum + 1`) is in the `elements` set. If it is, we increment both `currentNum` and `currentSeq`. This process will continue, finding consecutive elements in the set, until no more consecutive elements are found.
Finally, to get the length of the longest consecutive sequence, we update the `longestSeq` variable by choosing the maximum value between itself and `currentSeq`. This will keep track of the longest consecutive sequence found so far.
The process continues until all numbers in the original array have been checked, and at the end, `longestSeq` will store the answer - the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

3. Replace all '#'s back to 'O's.
    ","Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, _capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by_ `'X'`.

A region is **captured** by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[ ""X "", ""X "", ""X "", ""X ""\],\[ ""X "", ""O "", ""O "", ""X ""\],\[ ""X "", ""X "", ""O "", ""X ""\],\[ ""X "", ""O "", ""X "", ""X ""\]\]
**Output:** \[\[ ""X "", ""X "", ""X "", ""X ""\],\[ ""X "", ""X "", ""X "", ""X ""\],\[ ""X "", ""X "", ""X "", ""X ""\],\[ ""X "", ""O "", ""X "", ""X ""\]\]
**Explanation:** Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\[ ""X ""\]\]
**Output:** \[\[ ""X ""\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`. John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","To solve the problem of capturing all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X' in an `m x n` matrix `board` containing 'X' and 'O', we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The idea is to iterate through each cell in the matrix and if we find an 'O', we perform a DFS to Mark all the 'O's in the surrounded region as 'X'. We need to ensure that we do not flip 'O's on the border or adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the DFS function**: The DFS function will take the current row `r`, current column `c`, and the matrix `board` as input. It will mark the current cell as visited (we can use a separate visited matrix or mark the cell in place) and then recursively call itself on the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) if they are 'O' and within the matrix bounds.

2. **Iterate through the matrix**: We iterate through each cell in the matrix. If we find an 'O', we check if it is not on the border and if it is not adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped. If it meets these conditions, we call the DFS function on it.

3. **Mark the border cells**: To ensure that we do not flip 'O's on the border, we can mark all border cells as visited before starting the DFS. This way, any 'O' on the border will not be flipped.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:","python
def capture regions(board):
    m, n = len(board), len(board[0])

        for j in range(n):

    return board

def dfs(board, visited, r, c):

    The algorithm is based on depth-first search (DFS). It starts by iterating over substrings at each position and checks if the substring is a palindrome.

When the search reaches the end of the string, it adds the current list to the results list. After searching at a given position, it backtracks to the previous position and continues to search for palindromes. The overall time complexity is O(N * 2^N) where N is the length of the string.

```
    
    The algorithm maintains four variables: `total_gas`, `total_cost`, `start`, and `gas_tank`. We initialize these variables to 0. We then loop through each gas station and perform the following steps:

1. Add the gas at the current station to `total_gas`.
2. Add the cost of traveling from this station to the next one to `total_cost`.
3. Add the net gain/loss of gas (gas[i] - cost[i]) to `gas_tank`.
4. If the `gas_tank` is negative, update the `start` position to the next station and reset the `gas_tank` to 0.

After looping through all the gas stations, we check if `total_gas` is greater than or equal to `total_cost`. If it is, we return the `start` position, as this is the first gas station from which we can make a complete trip. If not, we return -1, because it is not possible to complete the circuit. 

This algorithm guarantees a unique solution because if there are multiple valid starting points, there must be a gas station with a lower cost to travel from it to the next station for each solution. As a result, the one with the lowest starting cost would always be chosen, ensuring uniqueness.

**Input:** gas = \[2,3,4\], cost = \[3,4,3\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == gas.length == cost.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104` John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","To solve this problem, we need to find a starting gas station such that the car can complete a circular route without running out of gas. We can use a greedy algorithm to achieve this.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the net gas available at each station:**
   For each station \( i \), the net gas available is \( gas[i] - cost[i] \). This represents the amount of gas left after traveling from station \( i \) to station \( i+1 \).

2. **Find the starting station:**
   We need to find a starting station \( start \) such that the cumulative net gas from \( start \) to \( start \) (after completing the circle) is non-negative. We can do this by iterating through each station and keeping track of the cumulative net gas. If at any point the cumulative net gas becomes negative, we start over from the next station.

3. **Check if a solution exists:**
   If we can find a starting station such that the cumulative net gas is non-negative after completing the circle, then a solution exists. Otherwise, no solution exists.

Let's implement this in Python:","python
def find_starting_station(gas, cost):
    n = len(gas)

    In this problem, we use two variables, ones and twos, to represent the number of occurrences of each bit in the array's elements.

Initially, both ones and twos are set to 0. We use XOR (^) to count the occurrences of each bit in the array. The reason we use XOR is that it cancels out the same bits, so if a bit occurs twice, it will be 0.

We then loop through each element of the array and use XOR to count the bit occurrences. If a bit occurs for the first time, it's XORed into ones; if it occurs for the second time, it's XORed into twos. If it appears for the third time, it should be removed from both ones and twos. To achieve this, we use the bitwise AND (&) along with the bitwise NOT (~) to clear the bits that appear in twos from ones and vice versa.

Finally, after looping through all the elements of the array, the variable ones will only contain the bits that occurred once in the array, and that is our result. So we return the ones variable.

1. **Initialize a DP Array**: Create a boolean array `dp` of size `n+1`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. `dp[i]` will be `true` if the substring `s[0:i]` can be segmented into dictionary words.

2. **Set Initial Value**: Set `dp[0]` to `true` because an empty string can always be segmented (by definition).

3. **Iterate Through the String**: For each position `i` from 1 to `n` in the string `s`, check if there exists a dictionary word `word` such that `s[j:i]` (where `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`) is equal to `word` and `dp[j]` is `true`. If such a word exists, set `dp[i]` to `true`.

4. **Return the Result**: After iterating through the entire string, `dp[n]` will be `true` if the entire string `s` can be segmented into dictionary words. Otherwise, return `false`.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:","python
def can_segment_string(s, word_dict):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [False] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = True

    The algorithm used is a combination of depth-first search with memoization. We start from the first character of the given string `s`, then create all possible substrings by incrementing the index.

For each substring, we check if it exists in the dictionary. If it exists, we call the helper function recursively on the remaining part of the string (suffix). This will give us all the possible combinations for the suffix. Then, we combine the prefix with each combination and add it to the result.

Memoization is used to store the results of the helper function for each substring encountered, so that we don't need to compute it multiple times. This speeds up the algorithm by reducing repeated computations.

Finally, we return the list of combinations where all the words are found in the dictionary.

We will use a set to keep track of the indices where we have already computed the possible sentences to avoid redundant calculations.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the recursive function**: The function will take the current index `i` in the string `s` and the dictionary `wordDict`. It will return a list of all possible sentences that can be formed starting from index `i`.

2. **Base case**: If `i` is equal to the length of `s`, we have reached the end of the string. In this case, we return a list containing an empty string, which represents a valid sentence with no more words.

3. **Check if we have already computed the result for this index**: If the index `i` is in the set `dp`, we return the precomputed result for this index to avoid redundant calculations.

4. **Iterate over possible word lengths**: We iterate over all possible lengths of the next word in the sentence, from 1 to the minimum of `n - i` (the remaining length of the string) and the maximum word length in `wordDict`. For each length, we check if the substring `s[i:i+length]` is in the dictionary.

5. **Recursively compute the result**: If the substring is in the dictionary, we recursively compute the possible sentences starting from the next index `i + length` and append the current word to each sentence. We then add these sentences to the result list.

6. ** store the result**: After computing the result for the current index, we store it in the set `dp` before returning the result list.

    The idea of the algorithm is using a stack. Initially, the root node is pushed to the stack. Next, we enter a loop that ends when the stack is empty. In each iteration, we pop a node from the stack, and insert its value at the beginning of the result list (to ensure the correct order for the postorder traversal), then, push its left child, and then its right child to the stack (if they are not null). In the end, we return the result list. The algorithm is non-recursive which makes it easier to understand for some. Since the result list will store the output in reversed order, this iterative version avoids the necessity of reversing the final output.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Initialize the LRU cache:**
   - Create an empty dictionary ` cache` to store the key-value pairs.
   - Create an empty circular linked list ` list` to keep track of the order of the keys.

2. **Add a function to add a new key-value pair:**
   - If the key already exists in the dictionary, update the value and move the key to the front of the list.
   - If the key does not exist, add the key to the front of the list and store the value in the dictionary.
   - If the number of keys exceeds the capacity, evict the least recently used key (the key at the end of the list).

3. **Add a function to get the value of a key:**
   - If the key exists in the dictionary, return the value.
   - If the key does not exist, return -1.

4. **Add a function to remove a key from the list:**
   - If the key is at the front of the list, remove it.
   - If the key is not at the front of the list, move it to the end of the list and remove it.

    The insertion sort algorithm for a linked list involves iterating through the list, removing one element at a time, and inserting it into the sorted sublist. We use a dummy node to act as the head of the sorted sublist, which initially has no elements. In each iteration, we compare the current element (its value) to the elements in the sorted sublist, and insert it into its proper position. This is done by updating the ""next"" pointers for the appropriate nodes. The process is repeated until all elements from the original list have been processed and added to the sorted sublist. At the end, the sorted sublist is returned, starting from the next node after the dummy head node.

Next, we merge these single-node lists in a sorted manner. We compare the values of the nodes and connect the nodes accordingly to return the sorted list.

Finally, we combine the sorted lists back together to get the final sorted linked list.
    ","Given the `head` of a linked list, return _the list after sorting it in **ascending order**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[4,2,1,3\]
**Output:** \[1,2,3,4\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[-1,5,3,4,0\]
**Output:** \[-1,0,3,4,5\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 5 * 104]`.
*   `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`

**Follow up:** Can you sort the linked list in `O(n logn)` time and `O(1)` memory (i.e. constant space)? Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","To sort a linked list in ascending order, we can use a ** merge sort** algorithm. Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the list into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together.

Here is the step-by-step process to implement merge sort for a linked list:

1. **Divide**: Recursively divide the list into two halves until each sub list contains only one element.
2. **conquer**: Sort each sub list by making a recursive call to the merge sort function.
3. **Merge**: Merge the sorted sub lists back together into a single sorted list.

    The algorithm uses a binary search approach to find the minimum element in the sorted rotated array. Initially, pointers `left` and `right` are set to the start and end of the array. The midpoint `mid` is calculated as the average of `left` and `right`. The main idea is that whenever `nums[mid]` is greater than `nums[right]`, the minimum element must be in the right half of the array; otherwise, we search in the left half. This ensures that the algorithm runs in O(log n) time, as the search space is reduced by half each iteration. When `left` and `right` meet, the minimum element is found at `left`.
    ","Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

*   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
*   `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","To find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array in \( O(\log n) \) time, we can use a binary search approach. The key observation is that in a rotated sorted array, the minimum element is the only element that is smaller than its previous element.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. ** Initialize two pointers **: `left` and `right` to the start and end of the array respectively.
2. ** While `left < right` **:
   - ** Find the middle point **: `mid = (left + right) // 2`.
   - ** Check if the middle element is the minimum **:
     - If `mid` is greater than `right` (i.e., the array is rotated to the left), then the minimum element is in the right half of the array. So, set `left = mid + 1`.
     - If `mid` is less than or equal to `right` (i.e., the array is rotated to the right), then the minimum element is in the left half of the array. So, set `right = mid`.

1. Calculate mid index.
2. If nums[mid] is greater than nums[high], it means the minimum element lies in the right half of the array, so we set low to mid + 1.
3. If nums[mid] is less than nums[high], it means the minimum element lies in the left half of the array, so we set high to mid.
4. If nums[mid] is equal to nums[high], we cannot be certain in which half the minimum element lies, so we simply decrement high by 1.

At the end, the minimum element will be at index low. The solution takes O(log n) time in the average case and O(n) in the worst case.

**Method read4:**

The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

File file( ""abcde `""); // File is  ""`abcde `"", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  ""abcd "", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  ""e "", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  "" "", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The `read` function will only be called once for each test case.
*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** file =  ""abc "", n = 4
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  ""abc "". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
Note that  ""abc "" is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** file =  ""abcde "", n = 5

    The algorithm relies on the read4 function provided, which reads 4 characters at a time. We read and store these characters in a buffer (`buf4`) and then transfer them one by one into the destination buffer (`buf`) until we reach the desired number of characters (`n`). We repeat this process until we have read `n` characters or reached the end of the `file`. If we reach the end of the file, the read4 function will return less than 4 characters, which is detected and used to break the loop.

In each language, we declare a buffer `buf4` of length 4 to store the characters read using the read4 function. We keep track of the total characters read (`totalRead`) and iterate through the characters in `buf4`, transferring them one by one to the destination buffer `buf`. We make sure not to exceed the requested number of characters `n`.

Once we reach the end of the file, the read4 function will return less than 4 characters. If this happens, we break the loop and return the total number of characters read, which is stored in `totalRead`.
    ","Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method to read `n` characters.

**Method read4:**

The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

File file( ""abcde `""); // File is  ""`abcde `"", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  ""abcd "", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  ""e "", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  "" "", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The `read` function will only be called once for each test case.
*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** file =  ""abc "", n = 4
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  ""abc "". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
Note that  ""abc "" is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** file =  ""abcde "", n = 5
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  ""abcde "". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** file =  ""abcdABCD1234 "", n = 12
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  ""abcdABCD1234 "". We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= file.length <= 500`
*   `file` consist of English letters and digits.
*   `1 <= n <= 1000` Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","To implement the `read` method using the `read4` method, we need to repeatedly call `read4` until we have read `n` characters. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of characters read.
2. Initialize a variable `i` to keep track of the current position in the file.
3. While `count` is less than `n` and `i` is less than the length of the file:
   - Call `read4,buf4` to read 4 characters starting from position `i`.
   - Add the number of characters read to `count`.
   - Update `i` to `i + 4`.
4. If `count` is less than `n`, it means we need to read more characters from the file. However, since we are only allowed to read in multiples of 4, we need to handle the remaining characters separately.
5. If `count` is equal to `n`, return `count`.

Here's the Python code to implement the `read` method:","python

    count = 0

In the `read` method, the first step is to check if we need to read more characters from `read4`. This is done by checking if `buffer_index` is equal to `buffer_len`. If it is, then we call `read4` and reset the `buffer_index` to 0.

If the number of characters read from `read4` is 0, then we have reached the end of the file, so we break out of the loop.

Next, we copy the characters from `buf4` to the destination buffer `buf` until either we have read enough characters (`cnt` equals `n`), or there are no more characters to copy from `buf4` (`buffer_index` equals `buffer_len`). After copying characters, we increment `cnt` and `buffer_index` accordingly.

We iterate through the string with pointer `r`. For each character, we increment its count in the hash map. If we have two or fewer distinct characters in the current substring, we update the current length `cur_len`. If we have more than two distinct characters, we move the pointer `l` to the right, decrementing the count of the character at `l` in the hash map, and removing it if its count becomes zero. We update `cur_len` accordingly in the process.

At each step, we update the maximum length `max_len` with the maximum of `max_len` and `cur_len`. We return `max_len` at the end.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `max_length`: This will store the length of the longest valid substring found so far.
   - `left`: This is the left boundary of the current window.
   - `right`: This is the right boundary of the current window.
   - `char_count`: This is a dictionary that keeps track of the count of each character in the current window.

2. **Move the Right Boundary:**
   - Iterate over the string from left to right, expanding the window by moving the `right` boundary.
   - Update the count of the character at the `right` boundary in the `char_count` dictionary.

3. **Check the Number of Distinct Characters:**
   - If the number of distinct characters in the current window (i.e., the number of keys in `char_count`) exceeds 2, we need to move the `left` boundary to the right.
   - While the number of distinct characters is more than 2, move the `left` boundary and update the count of the character at the `left` boundary in the `char_count` dictionary.

4. **Update the Maximum Length:**
   - After each valid window (i.e., a window with at most 2 distinct characters), update the `max_length` if the current window's length is greater.

5. **Return the Maximum Length:**
   - After iterating over the entire string, return the `max_length`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

*   `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
*   `listA` - The first linked list.
*   `listB` - The second linked list.

*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Input:** intersectVal = 8, listA = \[4,1,8,4,5\], listB = \[5,6,1,8,4,5\], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[4,1,8,4,5\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[5,6,1,8,4,5\]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

**Input:** intersectVal = 2, listA = \[1,9,1,2,4\], listB = \[3,2,4\], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
**Output:** Intersected at '2'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[1,9,1,2,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[3,2,4\]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = \[2,6,4\], listB = \[1,5\], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[2,6,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[1,5\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

*   `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
*   `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 8, listA = \[4,1,8,4,5\], listB = \[5,6,1,8,4,5\], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[4,1,8,4,5\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[5,6,1,8,4,5\]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 2, listA = \[1,9,1,2,4\], listB = \[3,2,4\], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
**Output:** Intersected at '2'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[1,9,1,2,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[3,2,4\]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = \[2,6,4\], listB = \[1,5\], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[2,6,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[1,5\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
*   The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
*   `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104`
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `0 <= skipA < m`
*   `0 <= skipB < n`
*   `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
*   `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

Then, we iterate through the lists, moving the pointer in the longer list one step at a time and the pointer in the shorter list one step at a time. When the two pointers meet, they will be pointing to the intersection node.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Determine the lengths of the two lists.
2. Initialize two pointers, one for each list, at their respective heads.
3. If the lengths of the lists are different, move the pointer in the longer list one step at a time until the lengths are equal.

The key idea is to compare the middle element with its neighbors and eliminate half of the array based on the comparison.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize the search range:**
   - Set the left index `l` to 0.
   - Set the right index `r` to `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array.

   - While `l <= r`, do the following:
     - Calculate the middle index `m` as `l + (r - l) // 2`.
     - Compare the middle element `nums[m]` with its neighbors `nums[m-1]` and `nums[m+1]`.
     - If `m` is a peak element (i.e., `nums[m] > nums[m-1]` and `nums[m] > nums[m+1]`), return `m`.

     - If `nums[m] < nums[m+1]`, then the peak element must be in the right half of the array. Set `l` to `m + 1`.

3. ** handle edge cases:**

4. The remainder of `columnNumber` divided by 26 is the index of the character in the A-Z range, which is added to the `result` string.
5. `columnNumber` is then divided by 26 and the loop continues until `columnNumber` is 0.

1. If `number` and `complement` are the same, we need at least two occurrences of the number in the hashmap to form a pair.
2. If `number` and `complement` are different, we have our required pair and return `true`.

     - If the room contains a demon (negative value), the knight loses health. Therefore, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i+1][j] + (-dungeon[i][j])` and `dp[i][j+1] + (-dungeon[i][j])`.
     - If the room is empty (0 value), the knight's health remains the same. Therefore, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i+1][j]` and `dp[i][j+1]`.
     - If the room contains a magic orb (positive value), the knight gains health. Therefore, `dp[i][j]` is the minimum of `dp[i+1][j] + (-dungeon[i][j])` and `dp[i][j+1] + (-dungeon[i][j])`.

    ","Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = \[
  \[ ""1 "", ""1 "", ""1 "", ""1 "", ""0 ""\],

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`

Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","To solve the problem of finding the number of islands in a given `m x n` 2D binary grid, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The idea is to iterate through each cell in the grid and, if we find a land cell (i.e., a cell with value `1`), we start a DFS from that cell to Mark all the connected land cells as visited. Each DFS call represents a new island.

Here is the step-by-step Python code to solve the problem:","python

A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:

    The algorithm to determine if a number is happy repeatedly performs the sum of the squares of its digits. We can use the slow and fast pointer method (also called the Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm). In this method, we have two pointers (`slow` and `fast`), both initially pointing to the input number `n`. In each iteration, the `slow` pointer moves to the next number in the sequence (by calling `getNext()`) while the `fast` pointer moves to the next of next number in the sequence. If at any point, we find that the `fast` pointer becomes 1, it implies that the number is a happy number. If the `slow` and `fast` pointers become equal and it is not 1, it implies that there is a cycle and the number is not a happy number.

`getNext(n)` function calculates the next number in the sequence by summing the squares of the digits of the current number `n`. This function is called in the main `isHappy(n)` function for updating `slow` and `fast` pointers.

- Assign the `next` attribute of the sentinel node to the given head node.
- Set the `prev` pointer to the sentinel node and the `curr` pointer to the head node.
- Loop through the linked list:
  - If the value of the current node matches the given value, remove it by updating the `next` attribute of the previous node.
  - Otherwise, move the `prev` pointer to the current node.
  - Move the `curr` pointer to the next node.
- After the loop, the new head of the linked list is found in the sentinel node's `next` attribute.

Topological sort is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed graph such that for every directed edge \(u \rightarrow v\), vertex \(u\) comes before vertex \(v\) in the ordering. If a topological sort exists, the graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and it is possible to finish all courses.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. ** Create a graph from the prerequisites:**
   - Initialize an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Initialize an array to keep track of the in-degrees (number of incoming edges) of each vertex.

2. ** build the graph and in-degrees:**
   - For each prerequisite pair \([ai, bi]\), add an edge from \(bi\) to \(ai\) in the adjacency list and increment the in-degree of \(ai\).

3. ** Find all vertices with in-degree 0:**
   - These vertices have no prerequisites and can be taken first. Add them to a queue.

4. ** Perform a topological sort:**
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Remove a vertex from the queue.
     - Add the vertex to the topological order.
     - For each neighbor of the removed vertex, decrease its in-degree by 1.
     - If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.

5. ** Check if all vertices are in the topological order:**
   - If the topological order contains all vertices, it is possible to finish all courses. Otherwise, it is not possible.

The `insert` function iterates through each character in a given word, adding new nodes to the tree if they don't already exist, and finally setting the `isEndOfWord` flag to true at the final node.

The `search` function follows the characters from the root of the Trie to the final node, returning false if any character does not map to a child node, otherwise returning the value of the `isEndOfWord` flag at the final node.

The `startsWith` function is similar to `search`, but returns true if a sequence of characters exists in the Trie, regardless of whether a word terminates at the final node.

   - Initialize a variable `current_sum` to store the sum of the elements in the current subarray. Set it to `0` initially.

2. ** Iterate Through the Array:**
   - Use the `right` pointer to iterate through the array.
   - Add the value of the element at the `right` pointer to `current_sum`.
   - While `current_sum` is greater than or equal to the target, update `min_length` with the minimum of its current value and the length of the current subarray (`right - left + 1`).
   - Subtract the value of the element at the `left` pointer from `current_sum` and move the `left` pointer one step to the right.

3. ** Return the Result:**

*   All the pairs `[ai, bi]` are **distinct**. John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","To solve this problem, we can use a topological sort algorithm. Topological sort is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed graph such that for every directed edge `u -> v`, vertex `u` comes before `v` in the ordering. This algorithm is perfect for our problem because each course has a set of Prerequisites that must be completed before it can be taken.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Create a graph**: We will represent the courses and their Prerequisites as a directed graph. Each course is a vertex, and each Prerequisite is a directed edge from the Prerequisite course to the course that requires it.

2. **Count the in-degrees**: We will count the number of incoming edges (in-degrees) for each vertex. This will help us identify which courses have no Prerequisites or have all their Prerequisites already completed.

3. **Perform topological sort**: We will use a queue to perform the topological sort. We will start with all vertices that have an in-degree of 0 (no Prerequisites) and remove them from the graph one by one, adding them to our ordering. We will repeat this process until the queue is empty.

4. **Check for cycles**: If there are any vertices left in the graph after the topological sort, it means there is a cycle in the graph, and it is impossible to finish all courses. In this case, we return an empty array.

Let's implement this in Python:","python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def find course_order(num_courses, prerequisites):
    # Create a graph
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    in_degrees = [0] * num_courses
    
    for course, prerequisite in prerequisites:
        graph[prerequisite].append(course)
        in_degrees[course] += 1
    
    # queue for topological sort
    queue = deque([i for i in range(num_courses) if in_degrees[i] == 0])
    
    # Perform topological sort
    course_order = []
    while queue:
        course = queue.popleft()
        course_order.append(course)
        for next_course in graph[course]:
            in_degrees[next_course] -= 1
            if in_degrees[next_course] == 0:
                queue.append(next_course)

When we add a word, we walk through the Trie, creating new child nodes if necessary, and set `is_word` to true for the last Trie node representing the word's last character.

When we search for a word, we use a helper function that takes the current Trie node, the word, and the current position in the word. If the current character in the word is a dot (`.`), we search for any matching character by iterating through all its children, recursively calling the helper function with the next position in the word. If the current character in the word is a lowercase letter, we proceed to the corresponding child node and continue the search.

At any point, if we reach the word's end, we check if the `is_word` of the current Trie node is true. If it is, we found a match. Otherwise, the search continues.

1. **Define the DFS function**: The DFS function will take the current position on the board, the current word being formed, and the board itself. It will recursively explore all possible paths from the current position and check if the word formed is in the list of words.

2. **Initialize the result list**: Create an empty list to store all the words found on the board.

3. **Iterate through each cell on the board**: For each cell, check if it is within the bounds of the board and if it has not been used in the current word. If it meets these conditions, add it to the current word and recursively call the DFS function with the next position and the updated word.

- `dp1[i]` represents the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from houses 1 to `i` without robing house `i`.
- `dp2[i]` represents the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from houses `i` to `n` without robing house `i`.

    The algorithm sorts the input array in descending order (non-increasing order). Then it returns the element at the index `k-1`. In the case of the C++ and Python implementations, the built-in `sort()` method was used to sort the array in descending order, while in the Java implementation, a min-heap was used for efficiency. In the Javascript implementation, the custom comparator `(a, b) => b - a` was used to sort the input array in descending order.

Sorting the array in descending order ensures that the kth largest element will be located at the index `k-1` (since indexing starts at 0).

This algorithm is a deterministic algorithm that can find the `kth` smallest element in an unsorted list in linear time. To find the `kth` largest element, we can simply find the `kth` smallest element in the negated array.

Here is the step-by-step implementation of the median of medians algorithm in Python:

1. **Negate the array**: Since we want to find the `kth` largest element, we can negate all elements in the array and then find the `kth` smallest element in the negated array. This will give us the `kth` largest element in the original array.

2. **Median of medians**: The median of medians algorithm works by dividing the array into subarrays of size 5 (or less), finding the median of each subarray, and then recursively finding the median of these medians. This median of medians is used as a pivot to partition the array into two parts: one part with elements less than or equal to the pivot, and the other part with elements greater than or equal to the pivot.

3. **Partition the array**: After finding the median of medians, we partition the array such that all elements less than or equal to the pivot are on the left side, and all elements greater than or equal to the pivot are on the right side.

4. **Recursively find the `kth` smallest element**: Depending on the position of the pivot after partitioning, we can determine whether the `kth` smallest element is in the left part, the right part, or the pivot itself. We then recursively apply the median of medians algorithm to the appropriate part of the array.

Here is the Python code to implement this algorithm:","python
def find_kth_largest element(nums, k):

We keep updating the current combination and decreasing `k` and `n` accordingly as we call the helper function recursively. When we have `k = 0` and `n = 0`, we know we have reached a valid combination and add it to our result list. To prevent revisiting the same combinations, we make sure that the numbers are considered in increasing order (thus, the current value being picked always starts at `current + 1`).

When backtracking, we remove the last considered element from the current combination so that we can try another combination. Following this approach ensures that we visit every potential combination only once and store it if it is valid.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the recursive function**: We'll create a function `find_combinations` that takes the current sum, the current combination, the current starting number, and the target sum `n` as parameters.

2. **Base cases**:
   - If the current sum is equal to `n` and the current combination has exactly `k` numbers, we have found a valid combination. Add this combination to the result list.
   - If the current sum exceeds `n` or the current combination has more than `k` numbers, we stop exploring this path.

3. **Recursive step**:
   - For each number from the current starting number to 9, add it to the current combination and update the current sum.
   - making a recursive call with the updated sum, the updated combination, the next starting number (which is the next number after the current number), and the target sum `n`.
   - After the recursive call, remove the last number from the current combination to backtrack.

4. **Initialize the process**: Start the recursive process with an initial sum of 0, an initial combination of an empty list, and a starting number of 1.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:","python

Next, we iterate through the sorted points. If the height is negative, meaning it's a left point of a building, we add the absolute value of the height to the heights set. If the height is positive, meaning it's a right point of a building, we remove the height from the heights set.

At each iteration, we compare the current maximum height to the previous maximum height. If the current maximum height is different from the previous maximum height, it means we've reached a key point in the skyline, so we add this x-coordinate and the current maximum height to the skyline result list.

We remove elements from the search tree that fall outside the window and add the current element to the search tree, maintaining the window size.

    The algorithm first initializes variables `result`, `sign`, and `num` along with a stack `st`. It iterates through each character of the given string, `s`. If a digit is encountered, we update `num`, otherwise, if an operator, `(` or `)` is found, we perform the appropriate operation and update the variables accordingly. For example, we store the current result and sign onto the stack when we encounter a `(` and calculate the result when we encounter a `)` and use the stack to track the values of previous results and signs. Finally, we return the final result after the iteration is complete.
    ","Given a string `s` representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return _the result of the evaluation_.

**Note:** You are **not** allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

**Input:** s =  "" 2-1 + 2  ""
**Output:** 3

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  ""(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8) ""
**Output:** 23

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105`
*   `s` consists of digits, `'+'`, `'-'`, `'('`, `')'`, and `' '`.
*   `s` represents a valid expression.
*   `'+'` is **not** used as a unary operation (i.e., `""+1 ""` and `""+(2 + 3) ""` is invalid).
*   `'-'` could be used as a unary operation (i.e., `""-1 ""` and `""-(2 + 3) ""` is valid).
*   There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
*   Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer. John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","To solve the problem of evaluating a given string `s` representing a valid mathematical expression without using the built-in `eval()` function, we can use a stack to handle the operations and parentheses. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize a stack** to store the numbers and operators.
2. **Iterate through each character** in the string `s`.
3. **If the character is a digit**:
   - Convert the digit to an integer and推入 the stack.
   - If the next character is an operator,推 the operator into the stack.
   - If the next character is a left parenthesis,推 it into the stack.
4. **If the character is an operator**:
   - If it is a plus or minus sign, pop the top of the stack (which should be a number) and add it to the running total.
   - If it is a left parenthesis, push it into the stack.
5. **If the character is a right parenthesis**:
   - Pop the top of the stack until the top is a left parenthesis.
   - Pop the left parenthesis and discard it.
6. **After iterating through all characters**:
   - Pop all remaining numbers from the stack and add them to the running total.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:","python
def calculate(s):

When we reach a null node, we pop the top of the stack (the leftmost node). This node will be the smallest value in the tree. We continue traversing the right subtrees, decrementing the value of k each time we pop a node from the stack. When the k becomes 0, we return the value of the current node – this is the kth smallest element.

    The algorithm checks if the given integer n is a power of two. First, we check if n is a negative number or zero, in which case it cannot be a power of two, so we return false. 

If n is positive, we can use bitwise manipulation to check if it's a power of two. A power of two in binary representation has only one bit set to 1 (e.g., 1: 001, 2: 010, 4: 100, 8: 1000). When we subtract 1 from a power of two, all the bits from the right of the set bit become 1 (e.g., 1-1: 000, 2-1: 001, 4-1: 011, 8-1: 0111). 

By performing bitwise AND operation (n & (n-1)) between n and (n-1), we can check if there is only one bit set in n. If the result is 0, that means there is no overlapping bit between n and (n-1), indicating that n is a power of two; returning true. Otherwise, return false.

We can use the bitwise AND operation to check if a number has exactly one bit set to 1. If we perform a bitwise AND operation between `n` and `n-1`, the result will be 0 if `n` is a power of two.

One efficient way to do this is to use a fast and a slow pointer to find the middle of the list, then compare the values of the nodes from the middle to the end with the values of the nodes from the beginning to the middle in reverse order.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. **Find the middle of the list using a fast and a slow pointer:**
   - Initialize a fast pointer and a slow pointer at the head of the list.
   - Move the fast pointer two steps at a time and the slow pointer one step at a time.
   - When the fast pointer reaches the end or the next node, the slow pointer will be at the middle or the middle-1 of the list.

2. **Compare the values of the nodes from the middle to the end with the values of the nodes from the beginning to the middle in reverse order:**
   - Initialize a variable to store the value of the head of the list.
   - Iterate from the middle to the end of the list, comparing each value with the value of the head.
   - If any values do not match, return false.
   - If all values match, return true.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:","python

2. Iterate through the given array.
3. Remove the elements that are out of the current window from the front of the deque.
4. Remove the elements that are smaller than the current element from the back of the deque.
5. Push the current index into the deque.
6. If the current index is greater than or equal to k-1 (window size), add the front element of deque into the results list.
7. Return the results list after iterating through the entire array.

    ","You are given an array of integers `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize the DEQ**: Start with an empty DEQ.
2. ** process each element in the array**:
   - **Add the current element to the DEQ**: Ensure that the DEQ always contains elements in decreasing order. This means that the front of the DEQ will always be the maximum element in the current window.
   - **Remove elements from the front of the DEQ if they are outside the current window**: If the front of the DEQ is an element that was added more than \( k \) steps ago, remove it from the DEQ.
   - **Remove elements from the back of the DEQ if they are smaller than the current element**: If the current element is larger than the element at the back of the DEQ, remove the element at the back of the DEQ.
3. ** store the maximum element in the current window**: After adding the current element and removing elements that are outside the current window, the front of the DEQ will contain the maximum element in the current window. Store this maximum element in the result list.

    The algorithm is a recursive divide-and-conquer approach. It starts by iterating through the `input` string and looks for operators (+, -, *). When an operator is found, the problem is divided into two sub-problems: left and right. These sub-problems are independently solved through recursively calling the `diffWaysToCompute` function with corresponding substrings. 

Each recursion returns a list of possible results for each sub-problem. For each operator, we combine these results by iterating through both lists and performing the corresponding operation (addition, subtraction, or multiplication).

If no operators are present in the input string, a base case is reached, and the current number in the input string is returned as the only result. The recursion ultimately produces a list of all possible results for the original expression by combining results from all sub-problems.

2. **Base case**: If the string `s` is empty, return an empty list.

3. **Identify the operators**: Iterate through the string `s` to find all the operators ('+', '-', '*').

5. **Combine the results**: For each pair of results from the two parts, apply the operator to combine them. Add the result to the list of results for the entire string.

                self.word_indexes[word] = []
            self.word_indexes[word].append(i)

    def shortest(self, word1, word2):
        indexes1 = self.word_indexes[word1]

        return min_dist
```    
    The algorithm first initializes a hashmap during instantiation, with each unique word, in the array wordsDict, as keys, and their corresponding indexes (in wordsDict) as values. 

The shortest() function accepts word1 and word2 as input arguments. The function is responsible for calculating and returning the minimum distance between the two input words in the given array wordsDict. To achieve that, it performs the following:

1. Store the index arrays for word1 and word2 in variables `indexes1` and `indexes2`.
2. Initialize variables `i` and `j` to 0, to iterate through the index arrays and initialize `min_dist` to the maximum value possible for the programming language.
3. Perform a while loop with the condition that `i` and `j` are lesser than the length of the arrays `indexes1` and `indexes2`, respectively.
4. Calculate `abs(indexes1[i] - indexes2[j])` and compare it against the current `min_dist`. If smaller, set `min_dist` to the new minimum distance.
5. If `indexes1[i]` is lesser than `indexes2[j]`, then increment `i`, otherwise increment `j`.
6. When the loop terminates, return `min_dist` which holds the shortest distance between the two input words in the array.
    ","Design a data structure that will be initialized with a string array, and then it should answer queries of the shortest distance between two different strings from the array.

Implement the `WordDistance` class:

*   `WordDistance(String[] wordsDict)` initializes the object with the strings array `wordsDict`.
*   `int shortest(String word1, String word2)` returns the shortest distance between `word1` and `word2` in the array `wordsDict`.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ ""WordDistance "",  ""shortest "",  ""shortest ""\]
\[\[\[ ""practice "",  ""makes "",  ""perfect "",  ""coding "",  ""makes ""\]\], \[ ""coding "",  ""practice ""\], \[ ""makes "",  ""coding ""\]\]
**Output**
\[null, 3, 1\]

**Explanation**
WordDistance wordDistance = new WordDistance(\[ ""practice "",  ""makes "",  ""perfect "",  ""coding "",  ""makes ""\]);
wordDistance.shortest( ""coding "",  ""practice ""); // return 3
wordDistance.shortest( ""makes "",  ""coding "");    // return 1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= wordsDict.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `1 <= wordsDict[i].length <= 10`
*   `wordsDict[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
*   `word1` and `word2` are in `wordsDict`.
*   `word1 != word2`
*   At most `5000` calls will be made to `shortest`. Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","To solve the problem of finding the shortest distance between two different strings in a given array, we can use a combination of a hash map and a minimum distance variable. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize the Data Structure:**
   - Create a hash map where the keys are the strings from the array, and the values are their indices.
   - Initialize a variable `minDistance` to a large number (e.g., `Integer.MAX_VALUE`).

2. ** Process Each Query:**
   - For each query `(word1, word2)`, check if both `word1` and `word2` are in the hash map.
   - If they are, calculate the distance between their indices as ` Math.abs(index1 - index2)`.
   - Update the `minDistance` if the calculated distance is smaller.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - After processing all queries, return the `minDistance`.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:","python
import java.util \*;

    // Hash map to store the indices of the strings

    public WordDistance(String[] wordsDict) {
        // Populate the hash map with the indices of the strings
        for (int i = 0; i < wordsDict.length; i++) {
            map put(wordsDict[i], i);
        }
    }

        // Check if both words are in the hash map
        if (map.containsKey(word1) && map.containsKey(word2)) {
            // Calculate the distance between their indices

            // Update the minimum distance if the calculated distance is smaller
            minDistance = Math.min(minDistance, distance);
        }

1. If m is 0, we return an empty string.
2. If m is 1, we return ""0 1 8"" representing the single-digit strobogrammatic numbers.

1. If m is not equal to n, add a '0' in between the characters and concatenate to the result string.
2. Add '1', '6', '8', and '9' in between the characters, and concatenate to the result string.

Then, in the strobogrammaticInRange function, we iterate through the range of lengths from `low` to `high`. For each length, we check if the strobogrammatic number of that length is within the range `[low, high]`, and if it is, we increase the count by 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strings = \[""a""\]
**Output:** \[\[""a""\]\]

    ```python
from collections import defaultdict

def groupStrings(strings):
    groups = defaultdict(list)

    for s in strings:
        key = tuple((ord(c) - ord(s[0])) % 26 for c in s)
        groups[key].append(s)

    return list(groups.values())
```
    
    The idea is to create a unique key for each group of strings, that depends on the relative distances between characters in a string. We iterate through the given strings and create the key for each string by taking the difference between the ASCII code of each character and that of the first character, modulo 26. We add these deltas as comma-separated elements and use them as the key in a map. Where a map is a hashmap in C++ and Java, defaultdict in Python, and Map in JavaScript. For each string, we append it to the list of strings corresponding to its group (key) in the map.

After iterating through all the strings, we return the list of groups from the map.

Note that the modulo operation and `<code>26</code>` come from the number of lowercase English letters which is 26. So, any shift greater than 25 will simply wrap around to the initial letters.
    ","We can shift a string by shifting each of its letters to its successive letter.

*   For example, `""abc ""` can be shifted to be `""bcd ""`.

We can keep shifting the string to form a sequence.

*   For example, we can keep shifting `""abc ""` to form the sequence: `""abc "" -> ""bcd "" -> ... -> ""xyz ""`.

John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","To solve the problem of grouping strings that belong to the same shifting sequence, we need to determine a unique representative for each sequence. One effective way to do this is to find the lexicographically smallest string in each sequence.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Define a function to shift a string**: We need a function that takes a string and returns the next string in the sequence by shifting each letter to its successive letter. For example, ""abc"" would become ""bcd"".

2. **Generate the shifting sequence for each string**: For each string in the input array, generate its shifting sequence until we start repeating strings. We can use a set to keep track of the strings we have already seen in the sequence to know when to stop.

3. **Find the lexicographically smallest string in each sequence**: For each sequence, find the lexicographically smallest string. This string will be the representative of the sequence.

4. **Group the strings by their representatives**: Use a dictionary to group the strings by their lexicographically smallest string in their sequence.

5. **Return the grouped strings**: Return the values of the dictionary as a list of lists.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:","python

1. If the current node is `null`, it returns `true`. This means that an empty tree is considered  a unival tree.

2. We recursively call the helper function for the left and right nodes of the current node.

3. If both left and right subtrees return `true`, it means that they are both unival subtrees. Then, we check if the current node forms a unival subtree by comparing its value with the left and right child nodes when they are not `null`. If the values are the same, we increment the count and return `true` for the current node.

4. If either of the left or right subtree is not unival, we return `false` for the current node.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Define the recursive function**: Let's call the function `count_uni_value_subtrees(root)`. This function will return the number of uni-value subtrees in the binary tree rooted at `root`.

2. **Base case**: If `root` is `None`, it means we have reached a leaf node or an empty tree. In this case, the number of uni-value subtrees is 0.

3. **Recursive case**: If `root` is not `None`, we need to check if the left and right subtrees are uni-value and have the same value as `root`. If they are, then the entire tree rooted at `root` is a uni-value tree. In this case, we increment the count by 1 and recursively count the number of uni-value subtrees in the left and right subtrees. If the left or right subtrees are not uni-value or have a different value than `root`, then the tree rooted at `root` is not a uni-value tree.

2. In the `next()` function, we return the value corresponding to the indices (or iterators) and increment the column (or iterator) by 1.

3. In the `hasNext()` function, we check if we have a valid element and if not, we try to move forward to the next row (or iterator) and reset the column (or iterator) to 0.

3. **Combining Results**: We combine the results from the recursive call with the current factor to form the complete factor combinations.

Initially, `lower_bound` is set to the minimum possible value.

For each number in the preorder array:

1. If the number is less than lower_bound, it means the number is trying to be added as a right child but the value is less than the minimum possible value, hence breaks the binary search tree property. So return false.
   
2. If the number is greater than the top of the stack, it means the number is the right child of the last node encountered. So, we pop from the stack and set the lower_bound to the last popped value until the stack is empty or the number is smaller than the top of the stack.
   
3. Push the number onto the stack.

The colors are represented as follows:
- 0: Red

We will recursively explore each path from the root to the leaves and store the paths as we go.

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. **Define the function**: Let's call the function `find_paths`. It will take the root of the binary tree as an argument and return a list of strings representing all root-to-leaf paths.

2. **Base case**: If the root is `None`, it means we have reached the end of a path, so we return an empty list.

We add the value of the root to the current path and recursively call `find_paths` on the left and right children of the root. For each path returned by the recursive calls, we append the value of the root to the path and add it to the list of paths.

1. **Sort the array**: First, we sort the array `nums` in non-decreasing order. This will allow us to use the three-pointer approach efficiently.

2. **Initialize the count**: Initialize a variable `count` to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of valid triplets.

3. **Iterate over the array**: We will use three pointers, `i`, `j`, and `k`, to find the valid triplets. Start with `i` at the beginning of the array, `j` at `i+1`, and `k` at the end of the array.

4. **Check the sum**: For each value of `i`, we will move `j` and `k` to find pairs \((j, k)\) such that \(nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target\).
   - If \(nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target\), then all pairs \((j, k)\) where \(j < k\) will form a valid triplet with `i`. The number of such pairs is \(k - j\). Add \(k - j\) to `count`.
   - If \(nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] \ge target\), then we need to move `k` to the left to find a smaller sum.

5. **Update the pointers**: After checking the sum, we move `j` to the right and `k` to the left. If `j` reaches `k`, we move `i` to the right and reset `j` to `i+1` and `k` to the end of the array.

    The algorithm uses XOR operation to find the two unique numbers. First, we XOR all numbers in the array (which cancels out the repeating numbers), and the result of this XOR operation is actually the XOR of the two unique numbers. Then, we find the rightmost bit that is set to 1 in this XOR result. This bit will be different for the two unique numbers.

Next, we split the numbers into two groups: one group has that bit set, and the other group doesn't. XOR all numbers in both groups separately, and the result of the XOR operation for each group will be one of the unique numbers. This is because, within each group, the equal numbers will cancel themselves out, leaving the unique numbers as the result.

This algorithm has a linear runtime complexity (O(n)) and uses constant extra space, as required.
    ","Given an integer array `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in **any order**.

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear runtime complexity and uses only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,1,3,2,5\]
**Output:** \[3,5\]
**Explanation: ** \[5, 3\] is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[-1,0\]
**Output:** \[-1,0\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1\]
**Output:** \[1,0\]

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
*   Each integer in `nums` will appear twice, only two integers will appear once. Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","To solve this problem, we can use the properties of the XOR operation. The XOR of a number with itself is zero, and the XOR of a number with zero is the number itself. Therefore, if we XOR all the numbers in the array, the result will be the XOR of the two unique numbers.

Let's denote the two unique numbers as `a` and `b`. The XOR of all the numbers in the array can be written as:
\[ a \oplus b \oplus a \oplus b \oplus \cdots \oplus a \oplus b \]
Since each pair of `a` and `b` cancel each other out, the result is:
\[ a \oplus b \]

Now, we need to find the values of `a` and `b`. We can use the fact that the XOR of a number with itself is zero. If we take the XOR of all the numbers in the array and then find a number that is not zero, we can use that number to split the array into two parts: one part containing `a` and the other part containing `b`.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. **Find the XOR of all the numbers in the array.**
2. **Find a number that is not zero in the array.**
3. **Use the XOR of all the numbers and the number found in step 2 to split the array into two parts.**
4. **XOR all the numbers in each part to find `a` and `b`.**

Let's implement this in Python:","python
def find_unique_numbers(nums):
    # Step 1: Find the XOR of all the numbers in the array
    x = 0
    for num in nums:
        x ^= num
    
    # Step 2: Find a number that is not zero in the array
    y = x
    while y == 0:
        y = nums[0]
    
    # Step 3: Use the XOR of all the numbers and the number found in step 2 to split the array into two parts
    a = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num & y:
            a ^= num
    
    # Step 4: XOR all the numbers in each part to find `a` and `b`
    b = x ^ a
    
    return [a, b]

nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5]

We can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to check these conditions. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize a visited array**: Create an array `visited` of size `n` to keep track of the visited nodes during the DFS. Initialize all elements to `False`.

2. **Perform DFS**: Start the DFS from node `0`. During the DFS, mark each visited node as `True` and recursively visit all its adjacent nodes that have not been visited yet.

3. **Check for cycles**: If during the DFS we encounter a node that is already visited, it means there is a cycle in the graph. In this case, return `False`.

4. **Check for connectivity**: After the DFS, if there are any nodes that are still `False` in the `visited` array, it means the graph is not connected. In this case, return `False`.

    The algorithm uses the topological sorting algorithm with an adjacency list to represent the directed graph. The directed graph's vertices represent each unique character from the words array, and a directed edge between two vertices indicates that the first character appears before the second character in the alien language's dictionary.

It first initializes an adjacency list `graph`, an in-degree HashMap `inDegree` to store the in-degree of each character, and fills the HashMap with the unique characters from the words array, setting the initial in-degree of each character to 0. Then, it iterates through adjacent word pairs from the `words` array and adjacent character pairs from those word pairs, checking if they form an edge in the graph (i.e., the characters are different). If an edge is found, it is added to the graph, and the in-degree of the second character in the pair is incremented. In case we traverse through equal characters and later find the second string is shorter, we return an empty string as this indicates an invalid order.

To find the lexicographical order, we can use the topological sorting algorithm. We initialize a queue to store the characters with an in-degree of 0 (i.e. they have no incoming edges) and perform the following steps until the queue is empty:

1. Pop the front character from the queue and append it to the result string.
2. Iterate over all the neighbors of the popped character in the graph.
3. Decrement the in-degree of each neighbor.
4. Check if the in-degree of the neighbor is 0; if it is, push the character onto the queue.

Finally, if the length of the result string is less than the number of unique characters, return an empty string as it indicates there's no valid lexicographical order. Otherwise, return the result string.

   - Create a set to store all unique letters in the words.
   - Create a dictionary to store the dependencies between the letters. The key will be a letter, and the value will be a list of letters that come after it in the alien language.

2. ** analyzing the words:**
   - For each word in the list, iterate through its letters and add them to the set of unique letters.
   - For each pair of consecutive letters in the word, add a dependency from the first letter to the second letter in the dictionary.

3. **Perform topological sort:**
   - Use a topological sort algorithm to determine the order of the letters based on their dependencies.
   - If there is a cycle in the graph (i.e., a letter depends on itself), return an empty string indicating that there is no valid order.
   - If the topological sort is successful, return the sorted list of letters as a string.

When decoding, the receiving side searches for the delimiter and extracts the string's length just before each delimiter. It then uses that length to extract the original string extending from the position after the delimiter. It iterates over the received encoded string until all substrings have been extracted.

You are not allowed to solve the problem using any serialize methods (such as `eval`).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** dummy\_input = \[ ""Hello "", ""World ""\]
**Output:** \[ ""Hello "", ""World ""\]
**Explanation:**
Machine 1:
Codec encoder = new Codec();
String msg = encoder.encode(strs);
Machine 1 ---msg---> Machine 2

Machine 2:
Codec decoder = new Codec();
String\[\] strs = decoder.decode(msg);

**Example 2:**

**Input:** dummy\_input = \[ "" ""\]
**Output:** \[ "" ""\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
*   `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
*   `strs[i]` contains any possible characters out of `256` valid ASCII characters.

**Follow up:** Could you write a generalized algorithm to work on any possible set of characters? Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","To solve the problem of encoding and decoding a list of strings to a single string and back, we can use a simple approach where we concatenate all the strings in the list with a unique separator. This separator will help us to distinguish between the different strings when we decode the encoded string.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. ** encode **:
   - Initialize an empty string `encoded_string`.
   - Iterate through each string `str` in the list `strs`.
   - Add `str` to `encoded_string` followed by a unique separator (e.g., a vertical bar `|`).
   - After adding the last string, remove the separator from the end of `encoded_string`.

2. ** decode **:
   - Initialize an empty vector `strs2`.
   - Iterate through the characters of `encoded_string`.
   - When you encounter the separator `|`, add the substring from the start of the current segment to `strs2` and reset the segment.
   - After reading the last segment, add it to `strs2`.

Here is the Python code implementing the above algorithm:","python
def encode(strs):
    encoded_string = """"
    separator = ""|""
    for str in strs:
        encoded_string += str + separator
    encoded_string = encoded_string[:-1]  # Remove the last separator
    return encoded_string

def decode(s):
    strs2 = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        while i < len(s) and s[i]!= separator:
            i += 1
        if i < len(s):
           (strs2.append(s[i + 1:i + 1 + s[i + 1].length()]))
            i += 1 + s[i + 1].length()
    return strs2

# Example usage
dummy_input = [""Hello "", ""World""]

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Convert the BST to an In-Order List:**
   Perform an in-order traversal of the binary search tree to convert it into a sorted list. This is because the in-order traversal of a binary search tree yields a sorted sequence of its elements.

2. **Find theIndex of the Target Value:**
   Use binary search to find the index of the target value in the sorted list. If the target value is not found, find the index where it would be if it were inserted into the list.

3. **Determine the Range of indices:**
   Once we have the index of the target value, we need to determine the range of indices in the sorted list that are within the \( k \) closest values to the target. This range will be from \( \text{index} - \left\lfloor \frac{k-1}{2} \right\rfloor \) to \( \text{index} + \left\lfloor \frac{k-1}{2} \right\rfloor \).

    The algorithm is based on binary search. The idea is to find the pivot index 'mid' such that there are 'mid' number of elements greater than or equal to 'mid'. Since the array is sorted, we can leverage binary search by comparing the middle element's value to the number of elements on its right side (which can be calculated as 'n - mid'). If the number of elements on the right side is equal to the value at mid, we found the h-index. Otherwise, if the number of elements on the right side is less than the value at mid, we move our search to the left half of the array. If the number of elements is greater than the value at mid, we move our search to the right half of the array. This process ensures logarithmic time complexity as we eliminate half of the array in each iteration. Once our search is complete (right becomes less than left), we return the final h-index as 'n - left'.

The h-index is the maximum value of \( h \) such that the researcher has published at least \( h \) papers that have each been cited at least \( h \) times.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Binary Search Approach:**
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array respectively.
   - While `left` is less than or equal to `right`, do the following:
     - Calculate the middle index `mid` as \( \left( \frac{left + right}{2} \right) \).
     - Check if the number of papers with at least \( mid \) citations is at least \( mid \).
       - If \( citations[mid] \geq mid \), then the h-index could be \( mid \) or greater. So, set `left` to \( mid + 1 \).
       - If \( citations[mid] < mid \), then the h-index must be less than \( mid \). So, set `right` to \( mid - 1 \).
   - After the loop, the h-index will be the value of `right`.

2. ** Check Function:**
   - To check if the number of papers with at least \( h \) citations is at least \( h \), we can use a simple loop:
     - Initialize a counter `count` to 0.
     - Iterate through the array from the current `mid` to the end.
     - If \( citations[i] \geq h \), increment `count`.
     - If `count` becomes greater than or equal to \( h \), return true.
     - If `count` becomes less than \( h \), return false.

        different = (same + different) * (k - 1)
        same = temp

```
    
    We start with two cases when n equals to 0 or 1.
If n equals 0, it means there are no posts, so the result will be 0.
If n equals 1, it means there is only one post and k colors to choose from, so the result will be k.

After that, we create two variables: `same` and `different`. `same` stores the number of ways to color a fence at position i, such that the color of post i is the same as that of post i-1. `different` stores the number of ways to color the post at position i, such that the color of post i is different from that of post i-1.

For the first two posts, there are k ways to paint them the same color, and k*(k-1) ways to paint them different colors.

Then we use a loop starting from the third post (i=2) to the last post (i=n-1).
At each iteration, we update `different` by adding the previous `same` and `different` values and multiply by (k-1). This is because for different colors, they can either come from previous same colors or different colors, hence the addition. And then we multiply it by (k-1) to consider all possible color combinations excluding the previous color. After that, we update `same` by the previous `different` value, because now we need to consider the current post having the same color as the previous post.

Finally, we return the total number of ways which is the sum of `same` and `different`.

John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","To solve the problem of painting a fence with \( n \) posts using \( k \) different colors such that no three consecutive posts have the same color, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define \( dp[i][j] \) as the number of ways to paint the first \( i \) posts such that the \( i \)-th post is painted with color \( j \).

The base cases are:
- For \( i = 1 \), any of the \( k \) colors can be used, so \( dp[1][j] = 1 \) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( k \).
- For \( i = 2 \), any of the \( k \) colors can be used for the second post, so \( dp[2][j] = k \) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( k \).

For \( i \geq 3 \), the \( i \)-th post can be painted with color \( j \) if the \((i-1)\)-th post is painted with a different color or the \((i-2)\)-th post is painted with a different color than the \((i-1)\)-th post. Therefore, we have:
\[ dp[i][j] = \sum_{l \neq j} dp[i-1][l] + \sum_{l \neq j} dp[i-2][l] \]
This can be simplified to:
\[ dp[i][j] = (k-1) \cdot (dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-2][j]) \]

However, a more efficient way to compute this is to use the following recurrence relation:
\[ dp[i] = (k-1) \cdot (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) \]
where \( dp[i] \) is the total number of ways to paint the first \( i \) posts.

1. **Divide the people into two groups**: If \( n \) is even, divide the people into two groups of \( \frac{n}{2} \). If \( n \) is odd, divide the people into one group of \( \frac{n-1}{2} \) and one group of \( \frac{n+1}{2} \).

2. **Recursively find the celebrity in each group**: Use the `knows` function to determine which group contains the celebrity. If a person in the first group knows everyone in the second group, then the celebrity must be in the first group. Otherwise, the celebrity must be in the second group.

3. **Base case**: If \( n = 1 \), then the only person is the celebrity.

4. **Combine the results**: Once we have found the celebrity in each group, we need to check if the celebrity from the first group knows the celebrity from the second group.

    The algorithm used here is a binary search approach which starts with the range from the first to the last version. In each iteration, it takes the middle point and checks if it's a bad version by calling `isBadVersion()` API.

If the middle version is bad, this means that the first bad version is either the middle version or somewhere on the left side of the range. So, we update the right end of the range to the middle version.

If the middle version is not bad, the first bad version must be somewhere on the right side of the range. So, we update the left end of the range to the middle version + 1.

The loop will continue until the left and right pointers converge, indicating that we have found the first bad version. As a result, we return the value of the left pointer.

This algorithm has a complexity of O(log n), as it reduces the search range by half at each iteration hence minimizing the number of calls to the API.

    The ZigzagIterator class is initialized with two vectors `v1` and `v2`. The `hasNext()` method checks whether there are any remaining elements in either vector. When the `next()` method is called, decide which vector to take the element from based on the current indices comparing to the lengths of the vectors. If there're more elements in the first vector or equal number of elements in both but the current index of the first vector is less than the current index of the second vector, we take the element from the first vector. Otherwise, we take the element from the second vector. And in every step, we move the index of the chosen vector forward. We can swap the vectors every time we decide which vector to take the element from so that the implementation can work for k > 2 vectors (cyclic order).
    ","Given two vectors of integers `v1` and `v2`, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

Implement the `ZigzagIterator` class:

*   `ZigzagIterator(List v1, List v2)` initializes the object with the two vectors `v1` and `v2`.
*   `boolean hasNext()` returns `true` if the iterator still has elements, and `false` otherwise.
*   `int next()` returns the current element of the iterator and moves the iterator to the next element.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1,2\], v2 = \[3,4,5,6\]
**Output:** \[1,3,2,4,5,6\]

    The algorithm is based on a backtracking approach. We initialize a helper function with the initial parameters, such as the starting position, expression, and running sum. The helper function is then called recursively for each possible operator insertion. When the position reaches the end of the input string, we check if the running sum equals the target. If it does, we add the current expression to the result.

We use these parameters in the helper function:

- `pos`: The current position in the input string
- `currVal`: The current value of the expression up until this point
- `prevVal`: The value before the last operator we inserted
- `currExpr`: The expression string that we are building up

To avoid leading zeros in operands, we use a check to terminate the loop if we encounter a zero at the start.

Inside the helper function, we iterate over the possible next positions ('i') in the input string and decide which operation to perform at the current position:

1. Base case: When the current position is 0, we simply update the current value and expression with no operator.
2. Addition: We update the current value by adding the parsed value, and append ""+"" followed by the substring to the expression.
3. Subtraction: We update the current value by subtracting the parsed value, and append ""-"" followed by the substring to the expression.
4. Multiplication: We update the current value by first subtracting the previous value, then adding the product of the previous value and the parsed value, and append ""*"" followed by the substring to the expression.

After the helper function iterates through all possibilities, we return the result as a list of expressions that evaluate to the target value.

    The PeekingIterator class implements an iterator that supports the peek operation in addition to the regular hasNext and next methods. The constructor takes an existing iterator or iterable object, and initializes the class variables for keeping track of the next value and the internal iterator.

The peek method returns the next value in the sequence, without advancing the internal iterator. The next method returns the next value in the sequence and advances the internal iterator by calling its next method. The hasNext method checks if there are more elements left in the sequence by checking if the internal iterator's next value is not the end.

In all these implementations:

- C++ implementation uses the STL iterator standards and a vector iterator as input
- Java implementation uses the Iterator interface and expects an iterator of any collection implementing Iterable
- Python implementation accepts any iterable object as the input.
- JavaScript implementation assumes given input iterable supports the iterator protocol

The successor of a node `p` is the node with the smallest key greater than `p.val`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[2,1,3\], p = 1
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1\], p = 6
**Output:** null
**Explanation:** There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is `null`.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
*   `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   All Nodes will have unique values. Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","To find the in-order successor of a given node `p` in a binary search tree, we can use the properties of binary search trees. The in-order successor of a node `p` is the next node in the in-order sequence of the tree. This means it is the smallest node in the right sub tree of `p` (if it exists), or the next node in the in-order sequence of the left sub tree if the right sub tree is empty.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm to find the in-order successor:

1. If `p` has a right child, then the in-order successor is the leftmost node in the right sub tree of `p`. This is because the leftmost node in the right sub tree is the smallest node in that sub tree, and thus the next smallest node in the entire tree.
2. If `p` does not have a right child, then the in-order successor is the next node in the in-order sequence of the left sub tree. This means we need to find the in-order successor of `p` in the left sub tree.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:","python
def in_order_successor(root, p):
    if root is None:
        return None

    if p == root:
        if root right is None:

        else:
            return root right left

    if p val < root val:
        return in_order_successor(root left, p)

    The algorithm uses BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the shortest distances from empty rooms to gates. We first create a queue `q` and add all the gates' coordinates to it. Then, we create an array `directions` containing possible moves (up, down, left, right).

While the queue is not empty, we loop through all the gates in the queue, and for each gate, we explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right) and check if they are empty rooms. If they are, we update their distance to be 1 more than the current gate's distance, and add these neighbors to the queue. Once a room's distance is updated, it will not be updated again because that's the shortest distance found. The process continues until all reachable empty rooms have their distances updated.

This algorithm operates in O(m*n) time complexity, where m and n are the dimensions of the grid rooms, since each cell is visited once.

1. **Initialize the BFS queue**: Start by adding all the gate positions (where `rooms[i][j] == 0`) to a BFS queue. Also, initialize a visited matrix to keep track of the rooms that have already been processed.

2. **Perform BFS**: For each gate position, perform a BFS to update the distances of all the empty rooms. In each step of the BFS, move to the neighboring rooms (up, down, left, right) and update their distances if they are empty and have not been visited yet. Add these rooms to the BFS queue.

3. **Update the distances**: As we perform the BFS, update the distance of each empty room with the minimum distance found so far. If a room is reach from a gate, its distance will be the distance of the gate plus one.

4. **Finalize the distances**: After the BFS is complete, all the empty rooms will have been updated with their distances to the nearest gate. If a room was not reached by the BFS, it means it is impossible to reach it from any gate, so it should be filled with `2147483647`.

The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: **live** (represented by a `1`) or **dead** (represented by a `0`). Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

    Create a new board called `result` with the same dimensions as the input board. For each cell in the input board, count the live neighbors (the 8 neighboring cells). Then apply the following rules:
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die and all other dead cells stay dead.

To count live neighbors, iterate through a predefined list of relative coordinates `dirs` representing the eight neighboring cells. For each neighboring coordinate, check if it is inside the grid, and if the corresponding cell in the input board is live. If so, increment the counter of live neighbors.

Finally, update the cell in the result board using the rules.
    ","According to [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life): ""The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. ""

The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: **live** (represented by a `1`) or **dead** (represented by a `0`). Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, return _the next state_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[0,1,0\],\[0,0,1\],\[1,1,1\],\[0,0,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[0,0,0\],\[1,0,1\],\[0,1,1\],\[0,1,0\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = \[\[1,1\],\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** \[\[1,1\],\[1,1\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 25`
*   `board[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

**Follow up:**

*   Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
*   In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

A string `s` **matches** a `pattern` if there is some **bijective mapping** of single characters to strings such that if each character in `pattern` is replaced by the string it maps to, then the resulting string is `s`.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. **Check the lengths of the pattern and the string `s`.**
   If the lengths are not equal, it is impossible for `s` to match the pattern.

2. **Create a frequency count of each character in the pattern and each string in `s`.**
   Since the mapping is bijective, each character in the pattern must map to a unique string in `s`, and each string in `s` must map to a unique character in the pattern.

3. **Iterate through the pattern and check if each character maps to a unique string in `s`.**
   If a character in the pattern maps to a string that has already been mapped to by another character, or if a string in `s` has already been mapped to by another string, then the mapping is not bijective.

Let's break down the reasoning:

1. If `n` is a multiple of 4, the player whose turn it is will always lose. This is because the opponent can always make the remaining number of stones a multiple of 4 again, and this process will continue until the heap is empty.
2. If `n` is not a multiple of 4, the player whose turn it is can always make the remaining number of stones a multiple of 4. This means that the opponent will be forced to face a multiple of 4, and thus lose.

If the opponent doesn't win, the function returns true as it guarantees a win for the starting player. If no such situation occurs, the function returns false.

The runtime complexity of this algorithm is O(n * 2^n) where n is the length of the input string. The reason for this complexity is that, in the worst-case, we may have to explore every possible state of the game tree, and there are 2^n possible game states.
    ","You are playing a Flip Game with your friend.

You are given a string `currentState` that contains only `'+'` and `'-'`. You and your friend take turns to flip **two consecutive** `""++ ""` into `""-- ""`. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move, and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Return `true` _if the starting player can **guarantee a win**_, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** currentState =  ""++++ ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle  ""++ "" to become  ""+--+ "".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** currentState =  ""+ ""
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= currentState.length <= 60`
*   `currentState[i]` is either `'+'` or `'-'`.

**Follow up:** Derive your algorithm's runtime complexity. John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","To determine if the starting player can guarantee a win in the Flip Game, we need to analyze the game's state and the possible moves. The key is to use the concept of a ""winning position"" and a ""losing position"". A winning position is one where the player whose turn it is can force a win, and a losing position is one where any move the player makes will leave the opponent in a winning position.

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let's define a function `can_win(s)` that returns `True` if the string `s` is a winning position for the starting player, and `False` otherwise.

The base case is when the string is empty or has only one character. In these cases, the starting player cannot make a move, so the starting player loses. Therefore, `can_win("""") = False` and `can_win(""+"") = False`.

For a string of length `n` greater than 1, the starting player can make a move if there are two consecutive `++` in the string. If the starting player makes such a move, the string will be transformed into a new string with two fewer characters. The starting player wins if the new string is a losing position for the opponent. Therefore, we can write the recurrence relation as follows:","python
def can_win(s):
    if s == """" or s == ""+"":
        return False
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if s[i:i+2] == ""++"":
            if not can_win(s[:i] + s[i+2:]):

    The algorithm for solving the median in a list of integers works by maintaining two heaps, a max-heap for the left half and a min-heap for the right half. When a new number is added, it is compared to the max value of the left max-heap. If the number is smaller or equal, it is added to the left heap. If the number is larger, it is added to the right min-heap. Then, we balance the two heaps by ensuring that their sizes never differ by more than one. This ensures that the median is always easily accessible as either the largest value in the left heap or the average of the largest value in the left heap and the smallest value in the right heap. The algorithm has an O(log N) time complexity, where N is the number of elements in the list.

This approach ensures that the median can be found in constant time after each addition.

Here is the step-by-step implementation in Python:

1. **Initialize the Heaps:**
   - Create a Max heap to store the smaller half of the numbers.
   - Create a Min heap to store the larger half of the numbers.

2. **Add a Number:**
   - If the number is less than or equal to the root of the Max heap, add it to the Max heap.
   - If the number is greater than the root of the Max heap, add it to the Min heap.
   - After adding the number, ensure that the sizes of the two Heaps differ by at most 1. If they differ by more than 1, remove the root from the heap that has more elements.

3. **Find the Median:**
   - If the sizes of the two Heaps are equal, the median is the average of the roots of the two Heaps.
   - If the Max heap has more elements than the Min heap, the median is the root of the Max heap.
   - If the Min heap has more elements than the Max heap, the median is the root of the Min heap.

1. **Identify the coordinates of all friends:**
   Iterate through the grid and collect the coordinates of all cells that contain a `1`.

2. **Find the median of the x-coordinates:**

    The algorithm uses a Depth-First Search traversal (specifically, pre-order) to serialize the binary tree into a comma-separated string. Each empty node is represented by a ""null"" string.

To deserialize the data string back into a tree structure, the algorithm processes the comma-separated string and interprets each item it encounters. If the item is ""null"", it sets the node to null. Otherwise, it creates a TreeNode with the value and recursively sets left and right children. The deserialization also uses a pre-order traversal, which corresponds to the serialized string format.

It also updates an array `longestPath` that stores the longest path seen so far, allowing multiple levels of the recursive function calls to access and update it.

For each node, the function first calls itself recursively for left and right child nodes. Then, it checks if the left and right children are consecutive values to the current value, and if so, adds the corresponding paths to `currPath`. Finally, it compares `currPath` with the maximum path found so far and updates the `longestPath` array accordingly. The longest consecutive path is returned after the recursion is complete.

1. **Define a function ` longConsecutivePath ` that takes the root of the binary tree as an argument.**

2. ** Initialize a variable ` max_length ` to 0. This will store the length of the longest consecutive sequence path found so far.**

3. ** Define a helper function ` dfs ` that takes a node and its current length as arguments.**

4. ** In the ` dfs ` function, check if the node is ` None`. If it is, return 0.**

5. ** Initialize a variable ` left_length ` to 0 and a variable ` right_length ` to 0. These will store the lengths of the longest consecutive sequence paths in the left and right subtrees, respectively.**

6. ** If the value of the current node is one more than the value of its left child, set ` left_length ` to ` dfs(rootleft) + 1`. Otherwise, set ` left_length ` to 0.**

7. ** If the value of the current node is one more than the value of its right child, set ` right_length ` to ` dfs(rootright) + 1`. Otherwise, set ` right_length ` to 0.**

8. ** Update ` max_length ` by taking the maximum of ` max_length`, ` left_length`, and ` right_length`.**

9. ** Return the maximum of ` left_length ` and ` right_length ` + 1 (to include the current node).**

10. ** Call the ` dfs ` function on the root of the tree and return ` max_length `.

Then, it employs a nested loop to iterate over the input array from the second element onwards. In the inner loop, we compare each element from the 0th index to `i-1` with the current element at `i`. If the current element is greater than the previous element, we update the `dp[i]` value by taking the maximum of the current `dp[i]` value and the `dp[j]` value of the previous element + 1, which indicates the length of the increasing subsequence.

Finally, we update the max_length variable after each outer loop by taking its maximum from the array `dp`. After completing the iterations, we return the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    The algorithm uses the concept of prefix-sum to answer range-sum queries efficiently. In the constructor, we iterate through the input `nums` array and build an additional `pSum` array, which stores the prefix sum for each position i, i.e., sum of all elements from index 0 to index i (inclusive) of `nums`.

The `sumRange` method is simply a matter of taking the difference between two elements in the prefix-sum array. This difference will be the sum of elements between the given `left` and `right` indices (inclusive) in the input array.

The algorithm has a time complexity of O(1) for `sumRange` queries after the O(n) pre-processing of the input array during the constructor call. The space complexity is O(n) for the `pSum` array.

The prefix sum at an index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to and including the element at index `i`. With prefix sums, we can calculate the sum of any range in constant time.

Here's how we can implement the `Num Array` class:

1. ** Initialize the prefix sum array:**
   - Create a new array `prefixSums` of the same length as `nums`.
   - Set `prefixSums[0]` to `nums[0]`.
   - For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, set `prefixSums[i]` to `prefixSums[i-1] + nums[i]`.

2. ** Implement the `sumRange` method:**
   - If `left` is 0, return `prefixSums[right]` (the sum of the first `right+1` elements).
   - Otherwise, return `prefixSums[right] - prefixSums[left-1]` (the sum of the elements from `left` to `right` inclusive).

Here's the Python code for the implementation:","python
def Num Array(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    prefixSums = [0] * (n + 1)

    We can preprocess the matrix by creating a 2D array `dp` to store the sum of all elements in the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(i, j)` for each position `(i, j)`.

This way, we only need to calculate the sum once for each rectangle.

After preprocessing, we can answer the query `sumRegion(row1, col1, row2, col2)` in constant time. The sum of the elements in the query rectangle can be calculated as follows: `dp[row2 + 1][col2 + 1] - dp[row1][col2 + 1] - dp[row2 + 1][col1] + dp[row1][col1]`. This is done by taking the sum of all elements in the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(row2, col2)` and then subtracting the sums of the rectangles from `(0, 0)` to `(row1 - 1, col2)` and from `(0, 0)` to `(row2, col1 - 1)`, and finally adding the sum of the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(row1 - 1, col1 - 1)` to avoid double subtraction.

This involves precomputing the sum of all elements in the submatrix that starts from the top-left corner and ends at each cell in the matrix. This precomputation allows us to answer range sum queries in constant time.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the NumMatrix object:**
   - Create a 2D array ` prefixSum` of the same dimensions as the input matrix `matrix`.
   - Fill `prefixSum` such that `prefixSum[i][j]` contains the sum of all elements in the submatrix from \((0, 0)\) to \((i, j)\).

2. **Implement the `sumRegion` method:**
   - Use the precomputed `prefixSum` array to find the sum of the elements in the rectangular region defined by \((row1, col1)\) and \((row2, col2)\).
   - The sum of the elements in the rectangular region can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \text{prefixSum[row2][col2]} - \text{prefixSum[row1-1][col2]} - \text{prefixSum[row2][col1-1]} + \text{prefixSum[row1-1][col1-1]}
     \]
     This formula works because it subtracts the sums of the submatrices that are outside the desired region and then adds back the sum of the submatrix that is subtracted twice.

The Union Find data structure allows us to efficiently perform union and find operations on a set of elements, which in this case will represent the connected components (islands) in the grid.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the Union Find Data Structure:**
   - Create an array `root` of size `m * n` where each element represents the root of a tree (island). Initially, each cell is its own root.
   - Create an array ` size` of size `m * n` where each element represents the size of the tree (island). Initially, each cell has a size of 1.

2. **Define the Union Function:**
   - The union function takes two roots and合并 them into a single tree. This is done by finding the roots of the two trees and making one root the root of the other tree. The size of the new tree is the sum of the sizes of the two original trees.

3. **Define the Find Function:**
   - The find function takes a root and returns the root of the tree that contains the given root. This is done by following the parent pointers until we reach the root.

4. ** Process Each Add Land Operation:**
   - For each position \((r, c)\) in `positions`, convert the position into a index in the 2D grid by calculating \(i = r * n + c\).
   - Perform the union operation on the root of the cell at index \(i\) and its neighbors (if they are land cells).
   - Update the number of islands by subtracting 1 if the union operation resulted in a合并 of two islands.

5. **Return the Result:**
   - After processing all add land operations, return the array of the number of islands after each operation.

    The algorithm uses a prefix sum array to efficiently answer the range sum queries. The idea is to pre-process the input array by creating an auxiliary array prefixSum, where prefixSum[i] stores the sum of the first i elements. This allows us to compute the sum of elements in a range [left, right] in constant time, by simply returning the difference between prefixSum[right+1] and prefixSum[left]. To generate the prefixSum array, we iterate through the input array nums, and for each element, we add its value to the prefixSum array using the previous prefixSum value.

The time complexity of creating the prefixSum array is O(n) and each range sum query will take O(1) time since we just need to access and subtract two elements in the prefixSum array.

This array will store the sum of all elements in the submatrix from the top-left corner to each cell in the original matrix. This allows us to calculate the sum of any rectangular region in constant time.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Initialize the prefix sum array**: Create a new 2D array `prefixSum` with dimensions `m+1` by `n+1` and fill it with zeros. The extra row and column are used to handle edge cases when calculating the prefix sums.

2. **Calculate the prefix sums**: Iterate through the original matrix and update the prefix sum array accordingly. For each cell `(i, j)`, the prefix sum `prefixSum[i+1][j+1]` is the sum of all elements in the submatrix from `(0, 0)` to `(i, j)`.

3. **Update a cell**: To update the value of a cell `(row, col)` to `val`, we need to adjust the prefix sums of all cells that include this cell. This can be done by adding and subtracting the appropriate values from the prefix sum array.

4. **Calculate the sum of a rectangular region**: To find the sum of the elements in the rectangle defined by its upper left corner `(row1, col1)` and lower right corner `(row2, col2)`, we use the prefix sums. The sum is given by:
   \[
   \text{sum} = \text{prefixSum[row2+1][col2+1]} - \text{prefixSum[row1][col2+1]} - \text{prefixSum[row2+1][col1]} + \text{prefixSum[row1][col1]}

John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","To find all minimum height trees (MHTs) in a given tree, we need to consider the properties of trees and their heights. The height of a tree is the maximum number of edges in any path from the root to a leaf. A tree with \( n \) nodes has \( n-1 \) edges, and the height of a tree is minimized when the tree is as balanced as possible.

Here is a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Understand the Tree Structure**: We start by representing the tree as a graph. Each node is connected to its children through the edges given.

2. **Calculate the Height of Each Node**: We use a depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the height of each node in the tree. The height of a node is the maximum height of its children plus one.

3. **Identify the MHTs**: The root of a minimum height tree is a node that, when chosen as the root, results in the minimum possible height for the tree. We can find these roots by identifying the nodes that have the minimum height among all nodes in the tree.

3. **Repeat until we have the \(n\)-th super ugly number**: Continue this process until we have generated \(n\) super ugly numbers.

Let's implement this in Python:","python
def nth_super_ugly_number(n, primes):
    # Initialize the list of super ugly numbers with the first one
    super_ugly = [1]

    # Generate the next super ugly number until we have n of them

        next_ugly = float('inf')
        for prime in primes:
            new_number = super_ugly[-1] * prime

    The algorithm for vertical order traversal works as follows:
1. Create a mapping of columns to their corresponding node values. Initialize a queue to store nodes and their columns, starting with the root at column 0.
2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the node and column. Add the node's value to the corresponding column in the mapping.
3. Enqueue the node's left and right children with their respective column values (left child gets column -1, right child gets column +1).
4. After the queue is empty, collect the node values for each column in order and put them into the result array.

The algorithm works for each language implementation.

1. **Initialize a queue** to store the nodes and their positions. Each element in the queue will be a tuple containing the node and its vertical position.
2. ** Initialize a dictionary** to store the nodes' values grouped by their vertical positions.

4. ** While the queue is not empty**, do the following:
   - Pop a node and its vertical position from the queue.
   - Add the node's value to the dictionary at its vertical position.
   - Add the left child of the node to the queue with a vertical position that is one less than the current vertical position.
   - Add the right child of the node to the queue with a vertical position that is one more than the current vertical position.

    The algorithm uses a modified merge sort to track the count of smaller elements to the right of each element in the array. The modification is made to merge function. During the merge process, whenever an element from the right side of the array is merged into the sorted subarray (meaning it's smaller than some elements), the count for those elements from the left side of the array is updated by adding the number of elements in the left subarray processed so far. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) due to the merge sort, and space complexity is O(n) for the auxiliary arrays used.
