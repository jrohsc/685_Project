    The algorithm leverages a hash map (unordered_map in C++, HashMap in Java, dictionary in Python, and Map in JavaScript). It iterates through the given 'nums' array and calculates the complementary value (target - current value). If the complementary value is already in the hash map, it means that we found a solution, and we return those indices. If the complement is not in the hash map, we store the current element in the hash map with its index. If the algorithm doesn't find the solution, it returns an empty array or throws an exception (in Java).

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?","To solve the problem of finding two numbers in an array that add up to a given target, we can use a two-pointer approach. This approach works by sorting the array and then using two pointers to find the pair of numbers that add up to the target.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Sort the array**: This ensures that the numbers are in ascending order, which will help us find the pair more efficiently.
2. ** Initialize two pointers**: One pointer, `left`, starts at the beginning of the array, and the other pointer, `right`, starts at the end of the array.
3. ** Iterate until the pointers meet**: In each iteration, we check if the sum of the numbers at the `left` and `right` pointers is equal to the target.
   - If the sum is equal to the target, we have found the pair. We return the indices of these two numbers.
   - If the sum is less than the target, we move the `left` pointer to the right to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is greater than the target, we move the `right` pointer to the left to decrease the sum.
4. **Continue until the pointers meet**: We repeat this process until the `left` and `right` pointers meet. If they meet and we have not found a pair, it means there is no pair in the array that adds up to the target.

This approach involves maintaining a sliding window that expands and contracts as we iterate through the string.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize Pointers and Variables:**
   - Set two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the string.
   - Use a dictionary to keep track of the last position of each character encountered.
   - Initialize a variable `max_length` to 0 to store the length of the longest substring found.

2. **Iterate Through the String:**
   - Move the `right` pointer to the right, one character at a time.
   - For each character, check if it is already in the current substring (i.e., if it is in the dictionary and its last position is within the current substring).
   - If the character is in the current substring, move the `left` pointer to the right of its last position.
   - Update the last position of the character in the dictionary.
   - Calculate the length of the current substring (i.e., `right - left + 1`).
   - Update `max_length` if the current substring is longer.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - After iterating through the entire string, return `max_length`.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python:","python
def length_of_longest_substring(s):

1. **Determine the total number of elements**: Let `m` be the length of `nums1` and `n` be the length of `nums2`. The total number of elements in the merged array is `m + n`.

2. **Find the median position**: The median position in the merged array can be calculated as:
   - If `m + n` is odd, the median is at position \(\left\lfloor \frac{m+n}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\).
   - If `m + n` is even, the median is the average of the elements at positions \(\left\lfloor \frac{m+n}{2} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m+n}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\).

3. **Binary search for the median**: We can use binary search to find the median by comparing elements from both arrays. We need to find an index `i` in `nums1` and an index `j` in `nums2` such that:
   - `i + j = \left\lfloor \frac{m+n}{2} \right\rfloor` (for odd total elements)
   - `i + j = \left\lfloor \frac{m+n}{2} \right\rfloor` or `i + j = \left\lfloor \frac{m+n}{2} \right\rfloor + 1` (for even total elements)

4. **Compare elements**: At each step of the binary search, compare the elements at the current indices `i` and `j`:
   - If `nums1[i] < nums2[j]`, then the median must be in the right half of `nums1` or the left half of `nums2`.
   - If `nums1[i] > nums2[j]`, then the median must be in the left half of `nums1` or the right half of `nums2`.
   - If `nums1[i] = nums2[j]`, then this element is the median.

We will then iterate over all possible substrings of `s` and update the table accordingly.

    We use Dynamic Programming to solve this problem. We store intermediate results in a 2D boolean array `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` indicates whether the first `i` characters of `s` match the first `j` characters of `p`. We then loop through the characters of both strings and update the `dp` table.

If the current characters in `s` and `p` are equal or `p` has a '.', we update the `dp[i][j]` to the value `dp[i - 1][j - 1]`, because the match continues.

If the current character in `p` is '*', we have two options:

1. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as 0 occurrences. We update the `dp[i][j]` value to `dp[i][j - 2]`.
2. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as at least 1 occurrence. We update `dp[i][j]` to the value of `dp[i - 1][j] && (s[i - 1] == p[j - 2] || p[j - 2] == '.')`.

Finally, `dp[m][n]` stores the result, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of strings `s` and `p` respectively.
    ","Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where:

*   `'.'` Matches any single character.​​​​
*   `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""aa "", p =  ""a ""
**Output:** false
**Explanation:**  ""a "" does not match the entire string  ""aa "".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""aa "", p =  ""a\* ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** '\*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes  ""aa "".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  ""ab "", p =  "".\* ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**  "".\* "" means  ""zero or more (\*) of any character (.) "".

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 20`
*   `1 <= p.length <= 20`
*   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
*   `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'.'`, and `'*'`.
*   It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character `'*'`, there will be a previous valid character to match.","To solve the problem of regular expression matching with support for ` '.' ` and ` *' ` in Python, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will create a 2D boolean array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the first `i` characters of the string `s` match the first `j` characters of the pattern `p`.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize the 2D array `dp` with `dp[0][0] = True` because an empty pattern matches an empty string.
2. Fill in the first row of `dp` to handle the case where the pattern starts with ` *' `.
3. Fill in the rest of the `dp` array by considering the current characters of `s` and `p` and the previous states.

Let's implement this in Python:","python
def is_match(s, p):
    m = len(s)
    n = len(p)
    dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = True

    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if p[j - 1] == '*':
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1]

    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if p[j - 1] == '.' or p[j - 1] == s[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            elif p[j - 1] == '*':

    The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach, with one pointer starting from the left end and the other from the right end. It calculates the area between these two lines and updates the maximum area if the current area is larger than the previously calculated maximum area. If the height at the left pointer is less than the height at the right pointer, it moves the left pointer to the right. Otherwise, it moves the right pointer to the left. The algorithm continues until the pointers meet.

This algorithm ensures that the maximum area is found without having to check all possible pairs of lines because it always chooses the pair of lines with the maximum possible distance and minimum height difference at each step.

1. ** Initialize Pointers:**
   - Place one pointer at the beginning of the array (left) and another at the end of the array (right).

2. ** Calculate Area:**
   - The area of the container formed by the two lines and the x-axis is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{width} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - The width of the container is the distance between the two pointers, which is \( \text{right} - \text{left} \).
   - The height of the container is the minimum height of the two lines at the current positions of the pointers.

3. ** Update Pointers:**
   - Move the pointer that points to the shorter line towards the other pointer. This is because moving the pointer with the higher line would not increase the height of the container and would only decrease the width, potentially reducing the area.

4. ** Update Maximum Area:**
   - After each move, calculate the new area and update the maximum area found so far.

5. ** Repeat:**
   - Continue this process until the two pointers meet.

The numerals are written largest to smallest from left to right, but there are specific rules for subtraction. A smaller numeral placed before a larger numeral means subtraction. This happens for the pairs (I, V), (I, X), (X, L), (X, C), (C, D), and (C, M).

We can solve this problem by using a greedy algorithm. We start with the largest Roman numeral and subtract it from the given number as many times as possible until the number is reduced to zero. We then move to the next largest Roman numeral and repeat the process until the number is completely converted.

2. Initialize an empty string to store the Roman numeral.

3. **Use two-pointers**: For each `i`, we set two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the beginning and end of the remaining part of the array (from `i+1` to the end). We then move these pointers towards each other until they meet, checking if the sum of `nums[left]` and `nums[right]` equals `-nums[i]`.
4. **Add triplets to the result**: If `nums[left] + nums[right] = -nums[i]`, we add the triplet \([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]}\) to our result. We then move the pointers to the next elements, skipping any duplicates.

1. **Sort the array**: First, we sort the array `nums` in ascending order. This allows us to use the two-pointer technique effectively.

2. **Iterate through the array**: We iterate through the array with a loop, where the current element is denoted as `nums[i]`. For each `i`, we use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to find the other two elements that, when added to `nums[i]`, give a sum closest to `target`.

3. **Use two pointers**: Initialize `left` to `i + 1` and `right` to `n - 1` (the end of the array). Then, we move the pointers based on the sum of the three elements:
   - If the sum is less than `target`, we move `left` to the right to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is greater than `target`, we move `right` to the left to decrease the sum.
   - If the sum is equal to `target`, we return the sum immediately.

4. **Update the closest sum**: For each iteration, we calculate the absolute difference between the current sum and the target. If this difference is smaller than the previous closest difference, we update the closest sum.

2. **Use four pointers**: We will use four pointers, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, to find the quadruplets. We start with `a` at the beginning of the array, `b` at `a+1`, `c` at `b+1`, and `d` at `c+1`. We then move these pointers around to find all possible quadruplets that sum up to the target.

3. **Check the sum**: For each combination of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, we check if `nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d]` equals the target. If it does, we add the quadruplet to our result list. If it is less than the target, we move `d` to the right. If it is greater than the target, we move `c` to the right.

4. **Avoid duplicates**: To avoid duplicate quadruplets, we ensure that each quadruplet is unique. This is done by checking if the current quadruplet is the same as the previous quadruplet before adding it to the result list. We also move the pointers so that they do not revisit the same elements.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:","python
def fourSum(nums, target):
    nums.sort()

The algorithm uses a depth-first search to construct valid combinations of parentheses. It starts with `n` open parentheses and increments the number of close parentheses as it places an open parenthesis.

1. If the given array of linked-lists is empty, we return a null pointer.
2. The main function `mergeKLists` merges the first two lists in the array of linked-lists and appends the results (merged list) at the end of the array. It will then remove the merged lists from the beginning of the array. This process is repeated until only one linked-list remains in the array.
3. The function `merge2Lists` is used for merging two sorted linked-lists. The smallest element of the two lists is chosen as the head node and recursively merged with the rest of the lists.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(kN) and a space complexity of O(1), where k is the number of linked-lists, and N is the total number of nodes across all linked-lists.

3. **Merge the lists**: While the heap is not empty, do the following:
   - Pop the smallest element from the heap.
   - Add this element to the result list.
   - If there is a next element in the list from which the smallest element was taken, add it to the heap.

4. **Return the Number of Unique Elements**: After iterating through the entire array, the value of `j` will be the number of unique elements in the array.

    1. First, we handle the edge case where dividend = -2^31 and divisor = -1. The result must be 2^31, but since it's out of the signed integer range, we should return 2^31 - 1.
2. Calculate the sign of the result based on the signs of dividend and divisor.
3. We use the bitwise shift operator to handle divisions by powers of 2. In each iteration, we initialize the temp variable as the absolute value of the divisor to calculate how many times it fits into the remaining dividend. We then use another loop to repeatedly double the temp variable (by bitwise left shift) and check if the dividend is still greater or equal. If so, we also double the 'multiple' value associated with temp, as that's the actual quotient in the current iteration.
4. When the shifting loop exits, we subtract the current temp from dividend and accumulate the current multiple to our answer.
5. Once the dividend is less than the divisor, we break the loop and return the signed quotient by multiplying the sign variable to our answer.

1. **Determine the sign of the quotient:**
   - If both `dividend` and `divisor` have the same sign (both positive or both negative), the quotient will be positive.
   - If `dividend` and `divisor` have different signs, the quotient will be negative.

   - Subtract the absolute value of `divisor` from the absolute value of `dividend` until the result is less than the absolute value of `divisor`.
   - Count the number of subtractions performed.

4. **Determine the final quotient:**
   - If the original signs of `dividend` and `divisor` were the same, the quotient is the count of subtractions.
   - If the original signs were different, the quotient is the negative of the count of subtractions.

5. ** handle overflow:**
   - If the quotient is greater than `231 - 1`, return `231 - 1`.
   - If the quotient is less than `-231`, return `-231`.

Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. **Calculate the total length of the concatenated string:**
   Since each word in `words` has the same length, the total length of the concatenated string is `words length * word length`.

2. **Create a frequency map for the words:**
   Create a frequency map (or dictionary) to count the occurrences of each word in `words`.

3. **Iterate through the string `s` and check for concatenated substrings:**
   Iterate through `s` with a window of size equal to the total length of the concatenated string. For each window, check if the substring of `s` within the window is a permutation of the words.

4. **Check if a substring is a permutation:**
   To check if a substring is a permutation, compare the frequency map of the words in `words` with the frequency map of the words in the substring. If the frequency maps are the same, the substring is a permutation.

5. **Add the starting index to the result if the substring is a permutation:**

    The algorithm is a variation of binary search. The main idea is to decide whether the target is in the left or the right half of the current subarray. If nums[mid] >= nums[left], the left half is sorted. If target is in the range [nums[left], nums[mid]), set right = mid - 1. Otherwise, set left = mid + 1. If nums[mid] < nums[left], the right half must be sorted. If target is in the range (nums[mid], nums[right]], set left = mid + 1. Otherwise, set right = mid - 1. Continue the process until the target is found or the subarray is empty, in which case return -1. This algorithm has a runtime complexity of O(log n) because it eliminates half of the remaining elements at each step, similar to a binary search.
    ","There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return _the index of_ `target` _if it is in_ `nums`_, or_ `-1` _if it is not in_ `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,6,7,0,1,2\], target = 0
**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[4,5,6,7,0,1,2\], target = 3
**Output:** -1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1\], target = 0
**Output:** -1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
*   All values of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
*   `-104 <= target <= 104`","To solve this problem, we can use a modified binary search algorithm. The key observation is that after a rotation, the array can be divided into two parts: one part is sorted in ascending order, and the other part is also sorted in ascending order. We can use this property to find the target value in the array.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Find the pivot index**: The pivot index `k` is the index where the array is rotated. We can find `k` by comparing the first and last elements of the array. If the first element is greater than the last element, then the array is rotated at some index `k` such that `k > 0`. Otherwise, the array is not rotated (i.e., `k = 0`).

2. **Perform binary search**: Once we have the pivot index `k`, we can perform a binary search on the array to find the target value. We need to consider two cases:
   - If the target value is in the first part of the array (i.e., between `nums[0]` and `nums[k-1]`), we perform binary search on this part.
   - If the target value is in the second part of the array (i.e., between `nums[k]` and `nums[n-1]`), we perform binary search on this part.

3. **Return the result**: If the target value is found, return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

Here is the Python code for the solution:","python

    The given problem requires a binary search algorithm. We define two pointers, `left` and `right`, initially set to the first and last index of the array. We then enter a loop that continues as long as left is less than or equal to right. Inside the loop, we calculate the middle index, `mid`, as the average of left and right. If the value at this middle index is equal to the target value, we return the middle index. If the middle value is less than the target value, we set left to `mid + 1`, meaning we search the right half of the remaining array. If the middle value is greater than the target value, we set the right to `mid - 1`, meaning we search the left half of the remaining array. After the loop, if the target value is not found, we return the value of the left pointer, which represents the index where the target value should be inserted.

2. Once an empty cell is found, it tries to insert a number from 1 to 9.
3. For each inserted number, it checks if its placement is valid based on Sudoku rules:
   - The number must not be present in the same row or column.
   - The number must not be present in its corresponding 3x3 grid.
4. It calls itself (backtracks) recursively whenever a valid number is inserted into the cell.
5. If inserting a number fails to lead to a valid solution, the algorithm reverts that cell to '.' and tries the next number.
6. The process is repeated until a valid board is created or all possibilities have failed.

    The algorithm is a recursive backtracking algorithm. We define a helper function `findCombinations` that takes the following parameters:

1. `startIndex`: the index of the candidates array from which it can start choosing numbers.
2. `remaining`: the remaining sum needed to reach the target.

The base cases are:
- If `remaining` is 0, it means we have found a valid combination, so we return a list containing an empty list.
- If `startIndex` is equal to the length of candidates, or `remaining` is negative, there are no valid combinations, so we return an empty list.

In the function, we first initialize an empty list called `result`. Then, we make two recursive calls to `findCombinations`:

1. Excluding the current candidate at `startIndex` and incrementing `startIndex`, to search for combinations without this candidate.
2. Including the current candidate in the combination, and decreasing `remaining` accordingly (without updating `startIndex`).

After getting results from both recursive calls, we merge them and return the final list of combinations.

The main function `combinationSum` calls `findCombinations` with `startIndex` as 0 and `remaining` as the target, and returns the result after the recursion is done.

1. **Define the recursive function**: We'll define a function `find_combinations` that takes the current combination, the current index in the `candidates` array, and the remaining target sum as parameters.

2. **Base case**: If the remaining target sum is 0, we have found a valid combination. Add the current combination to the result list.

3. **Recursive case**: For each candidate at the current index, if the candidate is less than or equal to the remaining target sum, add it to the current combination and make a recursive call with the updated combination, the next index, and the reduced remaining target sum.

4. ** Avoid duplicates**: To ensure that we only get unique combinations, we can pass the current index as the second parameter to the recursive function. This way, we can skip adding the same candidate again if it has already been added in a previous level of recursion.

```

    
    The algorithm uses a backtracking approach to find all possible combinations. It starts by sorting the input `candidates` array/list. Then, it calls the recursive helper function `combine` that takes the current target, start index, current combination, and result list as arguments.

1. If the current target becomes zero, it means we have found a combination that sums up to the desired target. Add the current combination to the result list and return.
2. Iterate through the `candidates` list starting from the given index.
   - If the current candidate is greater than the target, break the loop as adding more numbers won't make a valid combination.
   - Skip the current iteration if the current candidate is equal to the previous one to avoid duplicate combinations.
   - Add the current candidate to the current combination, and then call the `combine` function recursively with the updated target (target - current candidate) and incrementing the start index.
   - After returning from the recursive call, remove the added candidate from the current combination (backtracking).

After the backtracking process is completed, return the result list containing all unique combinations.
    ","Given a collection of candidate numbers (`candidates`) and a target number (`target`), find all unique combinations in `candidates` where the candidate numbers sum to `target`.

Each number in `candidates` may only be used **once** in the combination.

**Note:** The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** candidates = \[10,1,2,7,6,1,5\], target = 8
**Output:** 
\[
\[1,1,6\],
\[1,2,5\],
\[1,7\],
\[2,6\]
\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** candidates = \[2,5,2,1,2\], target = 5
**Output:** 
\[
\[1,2,2\],
\[5\]
\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= candidates.length <= 100`
*   `1 <= candidates[i] <= 50`
*   `1 <= target <= 30`","To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach. We will iterate through the `candidates` list and for each number, we will check if it can be included in the current combination. If it can, we will add it to the combination and recursively call the function with the updated combination and the remaining target. After the recursive call, we will remove the number from the combination to backtrack and try the next number.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:","python
def find_combinations(candidates, target):
    result = []
    candidates.sort()
    backtrack(result, candidates, target, 0, [])

    The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach, initializing left and right pointers to the beginning and end of the elevation map, respectively. It also initializes two variables `maxLeft` and `maxRight` to keep track of the maximum heights on the left and right of the pointers, as well as a variable `water` to store the trapped water.

The algorithm iterates through the elevation map until the left pointer is less than the right pointer. In each iteration, it compares the values at both pointers to determine which side is shorter. If the value at the left pointer is less than or equal to the value at the right pointer, it means water can be trapped on the left side up to the height of the shorter bar. The algorithm updates `maxLeft` with the maximum height on the left side and then adds the trapped water (which is the difference between the maximum height and the current height) to the `water` variable. The left pointer is then incremented. If the value at the right pointer is smaller, the same logic is applied to the right side and the right pointer is decremented.

This process is repeated until the left pointer is no longer less than the right pointer, at which point the total trapped water has been calculated and the `water` variable is returned. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) as it only uses constant extra space.

2. Fill in the first row of `dp` based on whether the pattern starts with `*`. If it does, then `dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1]` because `*` can match an empty string.
3. For each other cell `dp[i][j]`, check if the current characters of `s` and `p` match or if the pattern character is `*`. If they match or the pattern character is `*`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]` or `dp[i][j-1]` or `dp[i-1][j-1]` depending on the previous matches.
4. If the pattern character is `?`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]` because `?` matches any single character.

    We initialize jumps to count the number of jumps, current_end to keep track of the farthest index we can reach with the current number of jumps, and current_farthest to keep track of the farthest index that can be reached from the current position.

We loop through the array up to the second last element. For each index, we calculate and store the farthest index that can be reached from the current index. If the current index equals the current end, we increment the jumps, as we need one more jump to reach or go beyond the current end, and update the current_end with the current_farthest value.

Finally, we return the number of jumps which represents the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the last index.
    ","You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at `nums[0]`.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index `i`. In other words, if you are at `nums[i]`, you can jump to any `nums[i + j]` where:

*   `0 <= j <= nums[i]` and
*   `i + j < n`

Return _the minimum number of jumps to reach_ `nums[n - 1]`. The test cases are generated such that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,1,1,4\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,3,0,1,4\]
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
*   It's guaranteed that you can reach `nums[n - 1]`.","To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will keep track of the farthest we can reach from the current position and update our position accordingly. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize the current position `i` to 0 and the farthest we can reach `max_reach` to 0.
2. Iterate through the array from `i` to `n-1`.
3. For each index `i`, update `max_reach` to the maximum of `max_reach` and `i + nums[i]`.
4. If `max_reach` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, return the number of jumps taken.
5. If `max_reach` is less than `n-1`, increment the number of jumps taken and update `i` to `max_reach`.

Here's the Python code for the solution:","python

    The algorithm uses backtracking to generate all possible permutations. It works by swapping the elements in the input array in a recursive manner.

1. The base case is when the index reaches the last element of the array; at this point, we append the current configuration to the ""results"" list.
2. For each index, we iterate from `index` to the end of the array, performing the following steps:
    a. Swap `index` and `i` elements.
    b. Recursively call the helper function with `index + 1`.
    c. Swap the elements back to their original positions.

This will generate all possible permutations, as it swaps elements in different positions while maintaining the original order in the input array. The termination condition for the recursion is the base case when we reach the end of the array. The complexity of this algorithm is O(N!), as there are N! permutations of an array of N elements.

    We use backtracking to generate permutations. Firstly, we sort the `nums` array to make sure that duplicate numbers are located together. Then, for each recursive backtracking call, we swap the elements in the range `[start, len(nums) - 1]` with `nums[start]`, ignoring already-visited elements by using a `visited` array.

We also skip any element that is equal to the current `start` element to avoid duplicates. After generating a valid permutation by iterating through all indices, we append the current permutation to the result array. When backtracking, we maintain the original order of elements before moving to the next level.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n! * n) since there are n! available permutations and each permutation requires O(n) time to build the solution. The space complexity is O(n) to store the `visited` array and temporary lists.

If no safe positions are found in the current column, then go back to the previous column and move the queen to another safe position. Repeat this process until all queens are placed in a valid configuration or all possible arrangements have been tried. During the process, whenever we successfully place `n` queens on the board, add that configuration to our result list. Finally, return the list of all unique solutions found.
    ","The **n-queens** puzzle is the problem of placing `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer `n`, return _all distinct solutions to the **n-queens puzzle**_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4
**Output:** \[\[ "".Q.. "", ""...Q "", ""Q... "", ""..Q. ""\],\[ ""..Q. "", ""Q... "", ""...Q "", "".Q.. ""\]\]
**Explanation:** There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 9`","To solve the **n-queens** puzzle, we can use a backtracking algorithm. Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, incrementally building candidates to the solutions and **abstaining** a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be extended to a valid solution.

Here is the step-by-step Python code to solve the **n-queens** puzzle:

1. **Define the Problem:**
   - We need to place `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard.
   - No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

2. **Set Up the棋board:**
   - Use a 2D list to represent the chessboard, where each cell can either be empty (denoted by `'}`) or occupied by a queen (denoted by `Q`).

3. **Backtracking Function:**
   - Start from the first row and try to place a queen in each column of the current row.
   - If a queen can be placed in a column without attacking any other queens, move to the next row and repeat the process.
   - If all queens are placed successfully, we have found a solution.
   - If we cannot place a queen in any column of the current row, backtrack to the previous row and try to place the queen in a different column.

4. **Check Validity:**
   - Before placing a queen in a cell, check if it is safe to place the queen there. A queen is safe if it is not in the same row, column, or diagonal as any other queen.

5. **Implement the Algorithm:**
   - Use a recursive function to implement the backtracking algorithm.
   - Keep track of the current state of the chessboard and the solutions found.

    The algorithm recursively places queens on columns and checks if the placement is safe, i.e., no queens are attacking each other. 
1. Maintain an array `cols` storing the row indices of placed queens. The index in this array represents the column the queen is placed in. This ensures that no two queens are placed in the same column.
2. Recursively place queens (column-wise).
3. Check for a safe position for each queen in the current column:
   a. Check for same row (`cols[i] == row`).
   b. Check for diagonal attack (`abs(i - col) == abs(cols[i] - row)`).
4. If the current position is safe, place the queen in the current column at the current row position, and continue to place the next queen.
5. If all queens are placed, increment the solution count.
6. If the recursive call finishes, backtrack by removing the queen from the current column and move on to the next row in the same column.
7. The base case is when the `cols` size equals `n`, meaning all queens have been placed safely; increment the count.

This approach considers all possible configurations for placing the n queens while avoiding visiting invalid configurations. It uses backtracking to explore the state space efficiently. The algorithm finds the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

We update the new interval's starting and ending points according to the merging process until no overlapping intervals remain.

    The idea is to use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We create a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `m` x `n` to store the number of unique paths to reach each cell in the grid.

Initially, we fill out the first row and first column of the `dp` array with 1 since there is only one way to reach any cell in the first row or first column: by moving either right along the first row or down along the first column.

Then, for every other cell in the `dp` array, we can calculate the number of unique paths to that cell by summing the number of unique paths to the cell above it and to the cell to its left. We can do this because the robot can only move down or right, so the paths to the current cell must have come from those two directions.

Finally, we return the value at the bottom-right corner of the `dp` array, which represents the number of unique paths the robot can take to reach the destination.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

Firstly, the number of rows and columns (m and n) are computed. Then, we initialize the left and right pointers (l and r).

In each step of the binary search, we calculate the middle index (mid) and get the corresponding value (mid_val) in the matrix. To get the value in the matrix, we divide mid by n and take the remainder.

We then compare the mid_val with the target. If it is equal to the target, we return true. If it's less than the target, we move the left pointer to the next position (mid + 1). Otherwise, we move the right pointer (mid - 1).

1. **Understand the Problem**: We have an \(m \times n\) matrix where each row is sorted in non-decreasing order, and the first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row. We need to find if a given target integer is in the matrix.

2. **Binary Search Approach**: We can treat the matrix as a single sorted list of length \(m \cdot n\). This is because the rows are sorted, and the first element of each row is greater than the last element of the previous row, which ensures that the entire matrix is sorted when read row by row.

3. ** Implement Binary Search**: We can use Python's built-in `binary_search` function from the ` bisect` module to find the position of the target in the matrix. The `binary_search` function returns the index of the target if it is found, or the index where it would be inserted if it is not found.

    The algorithm can be explained using three pointers: `red`, `white`, and `blue`. `red` is responsible for tracking the position where the next 0 should be moved to, starting from the beginning of the array. Likewise, `blue` is responsible for tracking the position where the next 2 should be swapped to, starting from the end of the array. `white` is responsible for iterating through the array.

While `white` is less than or equal to `blue`, check the current `nums[white]` value. If it is 0, swap it with the value at index `red`, and increment both `red` and `white`. If it is 1, simply increment `white`. If it is 2, swap the value at index `white` with the value at index `blue`, and decrement `blue` without incrementing `white` since the newly swapped value at index `white` might be 0 or 2.

1. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - Initialize three pointers: `red` at the beginning of the array (index 0), `white` at the current position (index 0), and `blue` at the end of the array (index `n-1`).

2. **Iterate Through the Array:**
   - Iterate through the array from the beginning to the end.
   - For each element at index `i`:
     - If the element is 0 (red), swap it with the element at the `red` pointer and increment both `red` and `white`.
     - If the element is 1 (white), do nothing and increment `white`.
     - If the element is 2 (blue), swap it with the element at the `blue` pointer and decrement `blue`.

3. **Stop When Pointers Meet:**
   - The iteration stops when `white` and `blue` meet or cross each other.

4. **Final Array:**

    The algorithm uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum window substring. We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window. 

1. Initialize an unordered_map or dictionary for `need` to store characters and their counts in `t`, and another for `window` to store characters and their counts in the current window.
2. Initialize `left` and `right` pointers, `valid` counter for keeping track of characters satisfying the criteria, and `start` and `length` for holding the answer substring information.
3. Iterate through the string `s` using the `right` pointer, and:
    - If the current character exists in the `need` map, update the count of the character in the `window` map, and increment `valid` if the count in the window is less than or equal to the count in need.
4. Check the validity by comparing `valid` with the length of `t`.
    - If valid, update the answer substring's `start` and `length` if the current window's length is less than the current minimum.
    - Then, increment the `left` pointer to slide the window until the current character count in the window goes below the count in `need`. Update the `valid` counter accordingly.
5. Return the answer substring, or empty string if no window was found.
    ","Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return _the **minimum window**_ **_substring_** _of_ `s` _such that every character in_ `t` _(**including duplicates**) is included in the window_. If there is no such substring, return _the empty string_ `"" ""`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""ADOBECODEBANC "", t =  ""ABC ""
**Output:**  ""BANC ""
**Explanation:** The minimum window substring  ""BANC "" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""a "", t =  ""a ""
**Output:**  ""a ""
**Explanation:** The entire string s is the minimum window.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  ""a "", t =  ""aa ""
**Output:**  "" ""
**Explanation:** Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == t.length`

**Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?","To solve the problem of finding the minimum window substring of `s` that contains all characters of `t`, we can use a two-pointer approach along with a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of characters in `t` and the current window in `s`.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the dictionary for `t`**:
   - Create a dictionary `t_dict` to store the frequency of each character in `t`.

2. **Initialize the two pointers**:
   - Set `left` and `right` to 0. These will be the left and right boundaries of the current window in `s`.

3. **Initialize variables for the minimum window**:
   - Set `min_length` to a large number (e.g., `m + 1`).
   - Set `min_window` to an empty string.

4. **Iterate over the characters in `s`**:
   - Use a while loop to move the `right` pointer from 0 to `m`.
   - For each character `s[right]` in `s`, update its frequency in a dictionary `s_dict`.
   - Check if the current window contains all characters of `t`:
     - Create a new dictionary `current_dict` by copying `s_dict`.
     - Remove characters from `current_dict` that are not in `t_dict` or have a frequency less than their frequency in `t_dict`.
     - If `current_dict` is empty, it means the current window contains all characters of `t`.
     - Update `min_length` and `min_window` if the current window is smaller than the current `min_length`.

5. **Move the `left` pointer**:
   - If the current window contains all characters of `t`, move the `left` pointer to the right until the window no longer contains all characters of `t` or `left` reaches `right`.

6. **Return the minimum window**:
   - After the loop, if `min_length` is still a large number, return an empty string. Otherwise, return `min_window`.

After the call, we ""undo"" the decision by removing the number from the current combination (backtracking).

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: We start with two pointers, `i` and `j`, where `i` is the slow pointer and `j` is the fast pointer. Initially, both pointers are at the beginning of the array.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**: We iterate through the array using the fast pointer `j`. For each element at position `j`, we check if it is the same as the element at position `i` or `i-1` (if `i` is greater than 0).

3. **  rite Elements**: If the element at position `j` is different from the element at position `i` or `i-1`, it means it is a new unique element or a second occurrence of an existing unique element. In this case, we move the slow pointer `i` to the next position and set the element at position `i` to the element at position `j`.

4. **Continue Iterating**: We continue this process until the fast pointer `j` reaches the end of the array.

5. **Return the Result**: After the loop, the slow pointer `i` will be at the position where the last valid element is located. The value of `i` is the number of elements in the array after removing the duplicates.

    The algorithm is based on a modified binary search. We start by setting two pointers named `left` and `right` at the first and last element of the array, respectively. We then enter a loop, which continues until the `left` pointer is less than or equal to the `right` pointer.

Inside the loop, we first calculate the middle index `mid` using the `left` and `right` pointers. If the middle element of the array is equal to the target, we return true, indicating that the target is found.

If the middle element is equal to the left element, we increment the `left` pointer. If the middle element is greater than the left element, we check if the target is within the left and middle elements. If it is, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one. Otherwise, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one.

If the middle element is still smaller than the left element, we then check if the target is within the middle and right elements. If it is, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one. Otherwise, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one.

After the loop, we return false if the target is not found in the array.

**Follow up:** This problem is similar to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, but `nums` may contain **duplicates**. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?","To solve the problem of finding a target value in a rotated sorted array that may contain duplicates, we can use a modified binary search approach. The key is to handle the rotation and duplicates in a way that allows us to efficiently determine if the target is in the array.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the rotation point:**
   - The rotation point is the index where the array is divided into two parts. The left part is greater than or equal to the right part.
   - We can use binary search to find the rotation point. The rotation point `k` is the index where `nums[k] >= nums[k+1]`.

2. **Perform binary search:**
   - Once we have the rotation point, we can perform a binary search in the appropriate part of the array.
   - If the target is in the range of the left part (from `0` to `k`), we search in the left part.
   - If the target is in the range of the right part (from `k+1` to `n-1`), we search in the right part.
   - If the target is equal to the rotation point, we return `true`.

3. **Handle duplicates:**
   - When handling duplicates, we need to ensure that we do not fall into an infinite loop. We can do this by checking if the current element is equal to the target before returning `true` or `false`.
   - If the current element is equal to the target, we return `true`.
   - If the current element is equal to the next element, we move to the next element without incrementing the search range.

    The algorithm uses a dummy node to simplify the handling of the head node of the linked list. We declare two pointers: `prev` and `curr` which are pointers to the previous and current nodes, respectively. 

The algorithm iterates through the list with the current pointer. If the current node's value is equal to the next node's value, we continue moving the current pointer along the duplicate values. Once we reach the end of duplicates, we check if the previous node's next pointer is pointing to the current node. If it is, it means there were no duplicates (prev and curr are consecutive), so we move the `prev` pointer to the current node. Otherwise, we set `prev.next` to `curr.next` to skip the duplicates. 

Finally, we move the current pointer to the next node, and repeat the process. The resulting list will have all duplicates removed, and the changes will persist as the dummy node is used to reference the head of the modified list.

    The algorithm to delete all duplicates in a sorted linked list simply iterates through the list and compares the value of the current node with the value of the next.

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: Create two pointers, `left` and `right`. The `left` pointer will point to the head of the list, and the `right` pointer will point to the next node after the head.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Iterate through the list using the `right` pointer. For each node:
   - If the value of the node is less than `x`, move the `left` pointer to the right and swap the values of the nodes at the `left` and `right` pointers.
   - If the value of the node is greater than or equal to `x`, move the `right` pointer to the right.

3. **Stop When `right` reach the End**: Once the `right` pointer reaches the end of the list, stop the iteration.

4. **Set the Partition**: After the iteration, all nodes to the left of the `left` pointer will be less than `x`, and all nodes to the right of the `left` pointer will be greater than or equal to `x`. Set the next node after the `left` pointer as the new head of the list.

Then, we iterate through the length of strings, dividing the strings into smaller substrings and checking if these substrings can be rearranged to form the scrambled string.

We can use a recursive approach to check all possible ways to divide and rearrange the substrings of `s1` to see if they can form `s2`. However, since the algorithm involves random choices, we need to consider all possible permutations of the substrings.

A more efficient approach is to use a set to keep track of all possible permutations of the substrings of `s1` and check if `s2` is in this set.

    The algorithm first sorts the given array, and then it generates all possible subsets. For each subset, it checks if it already exists in the result set. If not, it adds the subset to the result set.

The algorithm uses a backtracking approach. It starts with an empty subset and iteratively adds elements from the input array to the subset. It keeps track of the starting index to avoid creating duplicate subsets.

In the C++ and Java implementations, a `set` data structure is used to store unique subsets. In the Python implementation, Python's `set` is used along with itertools' `combinations` function to achieve the same result. In the JavaScript implementation, a `Set` object is used, but as it doesn't handle array comparisons properly, each subset is converted into a JSON string to compare the string representation of subsets.

At the end, the function returns the result set, converted into the desired format (list of lists or vector of vectors).

1. **Define the recursive function**: We'll define a function `find_subsets` that takes the current index in the array, the current subset, and the list of subsets found so far.
2. **Base case**: If the current index is equal to the length of the array, we add the current subset to the list of subsets and return.
3. **Recursive case**: For each element at the current index, we have two choices:
   - Include the element in the current subset and move to the next index.
   - Exclude the element from the current subset and move to the next index.
4. **Avoid duplicates**: To avoid duplicate subsets, we can sort the array first and then use a set to keep track of the subsets we have already found. However, a simpler approach is to use a set to check if a subset is already in the list of subsets before adding it.

Here's the Python code for the solution:","python

The base cases are:
- `dp[0] = 1` because there is exactly one way to decode an empty string (do nothing).
- `dp[1] = 1` if `s[0]` is not '0', because there is exactly one way to decode a single character (itself).

For `i` from 2 to `n` (where `n` is the length of the string), we can decode the string in two ways:
1. By taking the first character of the string and decode it alone. This is possible if `s[0]` is not '0'. The number of ways to do this is `dp[i-1]`.
2. By taking the first two characters of the string and decode them together. This is possible if the two-digit number formed by `s[0]` and `s[1]` is between 10 and 26. The number of ways to do this is `dp[i-2]`.

Therefore, the recurrence relation is:
\[ dp[i] = dp[i-1] \text{ if } s[0] \neq '0' \text{ and } \text{the two-digit number formed by } s[0] \text{ and } s[1] \text{ is not between 10 and 26} \]
\[ dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] \text{ if } s[0] \neq '0' \text{ and } \text{the two-digit number formed by } s[0] \text{ and } s[1] \text{ is between 10 and 26} \]

We then call the dfs function recursively, with the current index incremented by one, the current IP appended with the current character and a dot, and incrementing part by 1. If the current number is 0 (which indicates a leading zero), we also break the iteration.

2. **Base case**: If the current index `i` is equal to the length of the string `s`, we have reached the end of the string. At this point, we check if the current list of dots forms a valid IP address. If it does, we add it to the result list. If it doesn't, we do nothing.

3. **Recursive case**: If the current index `i` is not equal to the length of the string `s`, we have two options:
   - Insert a dot at the current index.
   - Do not insert a dot at the current index.

   For each option, we update the current list of dots and make a recursive call to `find_ip_addresses` with the updated parameters. After the recursive call, we remove the last dot from the list to backtrack.

4. **Check for valid IP address**: To check if a list of dots forms a valid IP address, we need to ensure that:

2. Set `dp[0][0]` to true since an empty string is an empty interleaving.
3. Fill in the first row and first column of the `dp` array. If the first character of `s1` matches the first character of `s3`, then `dp[1][j]` is true for all `j` up to the length of `s2`. Similarly, if the first character of `s2` matches the first character of `s3`, then `dp[i][1]` is true for all `i` up to the length of `s1`.
4. For the rest of the `dp` array, fill in each cell `dp[i][j]` based on the following conditions:
   - If the `i`-th character of `s1` matches the `i+j`-th character of `s3`, then `dp[i][j]` is true if `dp[i-1][j]` is true.
   - If the `j`-th character of `s2` matches the `i+j`-th character of `s3`, then `dp[i][j]` is true if `dp[i][j-1]` is true.

    The algorithm follows a simple recursive approach to determine if a given binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST). The key idea is to maintain a range for each node, which is defined by the minimum and maximum values that the node's value should be within. For example, the root node's value should be in the range of (-Infinity, Infinity). When traversing to the left child, the maximum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value, and for traversing to the right child, the minimum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value. The algorithm continues recursively in this manner.

A helper function, `isValidBSTHelper`, is defined and initialized with the root and the range (-Infinity, Infinity). If the node is `null`, it means that we have reached a leaf node and it should return `true`. If the value of the node is not within the specified range, it means that the node does not meet the BST requirement and the helper function should return `false`. If the node is valid, then the helper function proceeds to check for valid BSTs in its left and right subtrees with the updated range.

During the traversal, we will keep track of the last visited node and identify the two nodes that are out of order. Once we identify these two nodes, we can swap their values to restore the BST.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Perform an in-order traversal of the tree and store the nodes in a list.**
2. **Identify the two nodes that are out of order.**
3. **Swap the values of these two nodes.**

    # Perform an in-order traversal of the tree
    queue = deque([root])
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        if last_visited and current_val < last_visited_val:

                first_swapped = last_visited
            second_swapped = current
        last_visited = current

The algorithm will only return true if all nodes in both trees are the same.

At each level, the function checks if both nodes are null, indicating we've reached the end of both trees and they must be the same. Then it checks if either node is null, indicating that one tree is missing a node and they cannot be the same. If both nodes have the same value, we then recursively check their left and right children. If both children are the same, the function returns true. If at any point nodes are found to be different, the function returns false.

The function then checks whether the values of both nodes are equal and continues to call itself recursively, but with the arguments changed to evaluate the left subtree and right subtree symmetrically. If the left and right subtrees have symmetric nodes, the function will return true; otherwise, it will return false.

The recursive calls in the helper function flip the direction of traversal for both subtrees to ensure that the subtrees are compared symmetrically. In each recursive call, the appropriate child nodes are visited in opposite directions to make sure they can be properly compared.

    The algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) on both the preorder and inorder traversal results. This algorithm iteratively breaks the inorder sequence into left and right subtrees using the preorder array. The basic idea is that the first element of preorder traversal will always be the root of the tree. Then, we can find that root node's index in the inorder traversal, and create the left subtree from the elements to the left of the index, and the right subtree from the elements to the right of the index. Then we continue this process recursively.

To improve the performance of the search for the index, we can use a map (in C++, Java and JavaScript) or a dictionary (in Python) to store the indices of all elements in the inorder traversal. This way, we don't need to traverse the inorder array every time to find the index of the current element.

Since we're doing this for Python, Java, C++ and JavaScript, some data structures might look a bit different and have different functions to do the same action, but the algorithm used in all languages is the same.

- Preorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- Inorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- A map is used to store the indices for inorder traversal in C++, Java, and JavaScript, while a dictionary is used in Python.
- A helper function is used to recursively construct the tree.

    We are given the inorder and postorder traversals of a binary tree, and the task is to reconstruct the binary tree from this information. In the postorder traversal, the last element is the root of the tree. Knowing the root, we can divide the inorder traversal into left and right subtrees. With the knowledge of the left subtree size, we can divide the postorder traversal into left and right subtrees as well. We can then recursively build the left and right subtrees, and construct the tree accordingly.

The provided solution maintains a hashmap to keep the indexes of elements in the inorder traversal for easy access during the construction. It uses a helper function `_build` to carry out the recursive construction. The `_build` function takes in the range of elements to be considered in both inorder and postorder traversals and recursively constructs the tree, by dividing the inorder and postorder ranges into left and right subtrees, using the root found in the postorder traversal.

    left = minDepth(root.left)
    right = minDepth(root.right)
    return (left == 0 or right == 0) and left + right + 1 or min(left, right) + 1
```
    
    We perform a depth-first search on the tree. The base case would be an empty tree with a depth of 0.

For each non-null subtree, we recursively find the minimum depth of the left and right children. Then, we have three cases:
1. If both left and right children are null, then the current node is a leaf node, and the minimum depth is 1.
2. If either left or right child is null, we return the depth of the other child + 1.
3. If both children are non-null, we take the minimum depth of both children and add 1.

To handle all the cases in a single line, we use a ternary conditional expression in C++, Java, and JavaScript, and use the `and`-`or` short-circuit syntax in Python. We check if either left or right is 0, and in that case return left + right + 1 which handles cases 1 and 2; otherwise, we return the minimum depth of both children + 1, which handles case 3.

2. **Recursive Function**: We will use a recursive function to perform the DFS. The function will take the current node, the current path, and the current sum as parameters. It will explore all paths from the current node to its children.

3. **Base Case**: If the current node is a leaf (i.e., it has no children), we check if the current sum equals the target sum. If it does, we add the current path to the result list.

4. **Recursive Case**: If the current node is not a leaf, we recursively call the function for each child of the current node, updating the current path and the current sum.

6. **Perform the DFS**: We call the recursive function with the root node, an empty path, and a current sum of 0.

Let's define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of distinct subsequences of the first `i` characters of `s` that equal the first `j` characters of `t`.

The base cases are:
- `dp[0][0] = 1` because an empty string is a subsequence of an empty string.
- `dp[i][0] = 1` for all `i` because an empty string is a subsequence of any string.
- `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `j > 0` because a non-empty string cannot be a subsequence of an empty string.

For `i > 0` and `j > 0`, the recurrence relation is:
- If `s[i-1] == t[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]`.

    The algorithm to populate the next pointers is a simple modification of the pre-order traversal of the binary tree. We start with the root, and for each node, we check if it has left and right children. If so, we set the left child's next pointer to point to the right child. If the current node's next pointer is not null, we set its right child's next pointer to the left child of its next node. Finally, we recursively call the function on the left and right children.

}

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

The `next` pointer of the `prev` node is updated to the current node. The variable `prev` is then set to the current node. Repeat this process until the queue is empty which means we have visited all the nodes in the tree.

This approach allows us to visit each level of the tree from left to right and set the next pointers accordingly.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize a queue**: Start by adding the root node to a queue. This will allow us to process the tree level by level.

2. ** Process each level**: While the queue is not empty, perform the following steps:
   - Get the number of nodes at the current level by getting the size of the queue.
   - For each node at the current level, do the following:
     - Set the next pointer of the current node to the next node in the queue.
     - Add the left and right children of the current node to the queue.
   - After processing all nodes at the current level, set the next pointer of the last node in the queue to `NULL` to indicate the end of the level.

2. Iterate through the list of prices.
3. For each price, update the `min_price` if the current price is lower than the current `min_price`.
4. Calculate the profit if we sell the stock at the current price (i.e., current price - `min_price`).
5. Update the `max_profit` if the current profit is greater than the current `max_profit`.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit we can achieve after `i` days with `j` transactions.
   - We need to consider three states: `dp[i][0]` (no transactions), `dp[i][1]` (one transaction), and `dp[i][2]` (two transactions).

2. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[0][0] = 0` (no transactions on the first day).
   - `dp[0][1] = -prices[0]` (one transaction on the first day, we buy the stock).
   - `dp[0][2] = -prices[0]` (two transactions on the first day, we buy the stock).

3. **Transition Rules:**
   - For `dp[i][0]` (no transactions):
     \[
     dp[i][0] = \max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2])
     \]
     Since we are not making any transactions, the maximum profit remains the same as the previous day.
   - For `dp[i][1]` (one transaction):
     \[
     dp[i][1] = \max(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][0] + prices[i])
     \]
     We can either keep the same number of transactions or buy the stock on the current day.
   - For `dp[i][2]` (two transactions):
     \[
     dp[i][2] = \max(dp[i-1][2], dp[i-1][1] + prices[i])
     \]
     We can either keep the same number of transactions or sell the stock on the current day.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The maximum profit after all days with at most two transactions is `dp[n-1][2]`.

Let's implement this in Python:","python

    n = len(prices)

   - Start with the `begin word` in the queue.
   - Create a set to keep track of visited words to avoid processing the same word multiple times.

2. **Define a function to get all neighbors of a word:**
   - A neighbor of a word is another word that differs by exactly one letter.
   - Iterate through each letter in the word and replace it with every other letter in the alphabet to generate all possible neighbors.

3. **Perform BFS:**
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Dequeue a word from the queue.
     - If the word is the `end word`, add the current transformation sequence to the result list.
     - If the word has not been visited, mark it as visited and add all its neighbors to the queue.

4. **Return the result:**
   - If the `end word` is found, return the list of all shortest transformation sequences.
   - Otherwise, return an empty list.

Here's the Python code implementing the above algorithm:","python

    In this problem, we use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`:

1. Create an unordered set `dict` or `word_set` with all the words from `wordList` for fast look-up, and check if it contains the `endWord`.
2. Create a queue for BFS, initialize it with `beginWord`, and initialize `steps` variable to 1.
3. Repeat the following steps while the queue is not empty:
   a) For each level of BFS, store the current level size, and create an empty set for `current_level` (only in Python & JavaScript).
   b) Iterate for each word in the current BFS level:
      - Dequeue the next `currentWord`, and check for `endWord`; if found return the current `steps` value.
      - Iterate through each character of the `currentWord`; for every character, replace it with 26 possible lowercase alphabets.
        - If the new word is in the `dict` or `word_set`, enqueue it in the queue, and remove it. In Python and JavaScript, also add it to the `current_level` set.
      - Revert the character back to the original character.
   c) Increment the `steps` value by 1, and in Python/javascript, update the `word_set` by removing words present in `current_level`.

Now we iterate through the original array of numbers, and for each number, we check if `(number - 1)` is not in the `elements` set. If it's not in the set, it means we can start counting a new consecutive sequence.
Next, we create two variables, `currentNum` and `currentSeq`, and initialize them with the current number and 1, respectively.
We then use a while loop to check if the next number (`currentNum + 1`) is in the `elements` set. If it is, we increment both `currentNum` and `currentSeq`. This process will continue, finding consecutive elements in the set, until no more consecutive elements are found.
Finally, to get the length of the longest consecutive sequence, we update the `longestSeq` variable by choosing the maximum value between itself and `currentSeq`. This will keep track of the longest consecutive sequence found so far.
The process continues until all numbers in the original array have been checked, and at the end, `longestSeq` will store the answer - the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

*   `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.","To solve the problem of capturing all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X' in an `m x n` matrix `board` containing 'X' and 'O', we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The idea is to iterate through each cell in the matrix and if we find an 'O' that is surrounded by 'X', we will flip it and all other 'O's in the same region to 'X'. We need to ensure that we do not flip any 'O's that are on the border or adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define a function ` capture regions` that takes the matrix `board` as input.**

2. **Define a function ` dfs` that performs a depth-first search starting from a given cell `(i, j)`. This function will mark all cells in the region as visited and flip their values from 'O' to 'X'.**

3. **Iterate through each cell in the matrix. If a cell contains an 'O', check if it is surrounded by 'X'. If it is, call ` dfs` on that cell.**

4. **To check if a cell is surrounded by 'X', we need to check its four neighbors (top, bottom, left, right). If any of the neighbors are 'O', then the cell is not surrounded by 'X' and should not be flipped.**

5. **After iterating through all cells, the matrix `board` will contain the captured regions.**

Here is the Python code for the solution:","python

    m, n = len(board), len(board[0])

When the search reaches the end of the string, it adds the current list to the results list. After searching at a given position, it backtracks to the previous position and continues to search for palindromes. The overall time complexity is O(N * 2^N) where N is the length of the string.

1. **Define a function to check if a substring is a palindrome:**
   - A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.
   - We can use a two-pointer approach to check if a substring is a palindrome.

2. **Define a function to generate all possible palindrome partitions:**
   - We will use a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible partitions.
   - We will keep track of the current partition and recursively add palindromic substrings to it.
   - When we reach the end of the string, we add the current partition to the result.

3. **Implement the backtracking function:**
   - Start with an empty partition.
   - Iterate through the string from the current position to the end.
   - For each position, check if the substring from the current position to the current index is a palindrome.
   - If it is a palindrome, add it to the current partition and recursively call the backtracking function with the next position.
   - After the recursive call, remove the last added substring from the current partition to backtrack.

4. **Combine the results:**
   - After the backtracking function returns, combine all the partitions into a list.

    The solution uses dynamic programming with an array `dp` of length `n+1` representing  the minimum cuts. `is_palindrome` is a 2D matrix that stores whether the substring from `i` to `j` of string `s` is palindromic or not.

We first initialize the `dp` array with values (i-1) for each index 'i'. This represents the maximum possible cuts needed to satisfy the condition.

Then, we iterate over the string in a nested loop. For each substring `s[i:j]`, we check if it is a palindrome. If it is a palindrome, we'll update the `dp` array with the minimum value between the current value of the `dp` array and the value of the `dp` array at `[i]` plus 1. By doing this, we are considering all possible cuts for a palindromic partition of string `s`.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

   - Iterate from the start to the middle of the substring and compare characters at corresponding positions.

    The algorithm maintains four variables: `total_gas`, `total_cost`, `start`, and `gas_tank`. We initialize these variables to 0. We then loop through each gas station and perform the following steps:

1. Add the gas at the current station to `total_gas`.
2. Add the cost of traveling from this station to the next one to `total_cost`.
3. Add the net gain/loss of gas (gas[i] - cost[i]) to `gas_tank`.
4. If the `gas_tank` is negative, update the `start` position to the next station and reset the `gas_tank` to 0.

After looping through all the gas stations, we check if `total_gas` is greater than or equal to `total_cost`. If it is, we return the `start` position, as this is the first gas station from which we can make a complete trip. If not, we return -1, because it is not possible to complete the circuit.

If we can, we return the starting index. If we can't, we move to the next gas station and repeat the process until we find a valid starting point or determine that no valid starting point exists.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable `total_gas` to store the total amount of gas available and a variable `total_cost` to store the total cost of traveling around the circuit.
2. Initialize a variable `current_gas` to store the current amount of gas in the tank, starting with 0.
3. Initialize a variable `start_index` to store the starting gas station's index, starting with 0.
4. Iterate through each gas station from 0 to `n-1`.
   - Add the gas at the current gas station to `total_gas`.
   - Add the cost at the current gas station to `total_cost`.
   - Subtract the cost at the current gas station from `current_gas`.
   - If `current_gas` becomes negative, set `start_index` to the next gas station and reset `current_gas` to 0.
5. After the loop, check if `total_gas` is less than `total_cost`. If it is, return -1, indicating that it is not possible to travel around the circuit.
6. Otherwise, return `start_index`.

    In this problem, we use two variables, ones and twos, to represent the number of occurrences of each bit in the array's elements.

Initially, both ones and twos are set to 0. We use XOR (^) to count the occurrences of each bit in the array. The reason we use XOR is that it cancels out the same bits, so if a bit occurs twice, it will be 0.

We then loop through each element of the array and use XOR to count the bit occurrences. If a bit occurs for the first time, it's XORed into ones; if it occurs for the second time, it's XORed into twos. If it appears for the third time, it should be removed from both ones and twos. To achieve this, we use the bitwise AND (&) along with the bitwise NOT (~) to clear the bits that appear in twos from ones and vice versa.

Finally, after looping through all the elements of the array, the variable ones will only contain the bits that occurred once in the array, and that is our result. So we return the ones variable.

   - Specifically, for each word `word` in `word_dict`, check if `s[i - len(word)]` is a valid position (i.e., `dp[i - len(word)]` is `True`) and if the word `word` matches the substring `s[i - len(word): i]`.

3. **Update the DP Array:**
   - If a valid word is found, set `dp[i]` to `True`.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The final answer is `dp[n]`, which indicates whether the entire string `s` can be segmented into dictionary words.

    The algorithm used is a combination of depth-first search with memoization. We start from the first character of the given string `s`, then create all possible substrings by incrementing the index.

For each substring, we check if it exists in the dictionary. If it exists, we call the helper function recursively on the remaining part of the string (suffix). This will give us all the possible combinations for the suffix. Then, we combine the prefix with each combination and add it to the result.

Memoization is used to store the results of the helper function for each substring encountered, so that we don't need to compute it multiple times. This speeds up the algorithm by reducing repeated computations.

Finally, we return the list of combinations where all the words are found in the dictionary.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the recursive function**: The function will take the current index of the string `s` and the current sentence being built. If the current index reaches the end of the string, we add the current sentence to the list of possible sentences.

2. ** Iterate through the dictionary**: For each word in the dictionary, check if the word starting at the current index is a valid segment of the string `s`. If it is, we update the current sentence by adding the word and recursively call the function with the next index.

3. **Base case**: If the current index reaches the end of the string, we add the current sentence to the list of possible sentences.

    The idea of the algorithm is using a stack. Initially, the root node is pushed to the stack. Next, we enter a loop that ends when the stack is empty. In each iteration, we pop a node from the stack, and insert its value at the beginning of the result list (to ensure the correct order for the postorder traversal), then, push its left child, and then its right child to the stack (if they are not null). In the end, we return the result list. The algorithm is non-recursive which makes it easier to understand for some. Since the result list will store the output in reversed order, this iterative version avoids the necessity of reversing the final output.

The key idea is to visit the leftmost node of the tree first, then its right sibling, and so on, while keeping track of the nodes we have visited.

- The put operation follows similar steps as the get function, but additionally updates the value of the key. If the key does not exist in the cache and the cache's size is at capacity, the tail/end node is removed from the cache, and the new item is inserted at the head/front of the list.

The list will be used to determine the least recently used key. When the number of keys exceeds the capacity, we will remove the least recently used key from the list.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Initialize the LRU cache:**
   - Create an empty dictionary ` cache` to store the key-value pairs.
   - Create an empty list ` order` to keep track of the order of the keys.
   - Set the ` capacity` of the cache.

2. **Implement the ` get ` function:**
   - If the key is not in the dictionary, return `-1`.
   - If the key is in the dictionary, remove it from the list and return its value.

3. **Implement the ` put ` function:**
   - If the key is already in the dictionary, update its value and move it to the front of the list.
   - If the key is not in the dictionary, add it to the dictionary and the list. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity, remove the least recently used key (the last element in the list).

    The insertion sort algorithm for a linked list involves iterating through the list, removing one element at a time, and inserting it into the sorted sublist. We use a dummy node to act as the head of the sorted sublist, which initially has no elements. In each iteration, we compare the current element (its value) to the elements in the sorted sublist, and insert it into its proper position. This is done by updating the ""next"" pointers for the appropriate nodes. The process is repeated until all elements from the original list have been processed and added to the sorted sublist. At the end, the sorted sublist is returned, starting from the next node after the dummy head node.

3. Join the reversed array of words into a single string with a space delimiter. In C++, we concatenate words with a space but avoid adding an extra space at the end. In Java, we use `String.join()`, in Python, use `join()` on the delimiter string, and in JavaScript, use `join()` on the array.

    The overall algorithm is based on the binary search. We maintain two pointers low and high, initially set to the first and last indices of array nums. Then we perform the following steps until low is less than high:

1. Calculate mid index.
2. If nums[mid] is greater than nums[high], it means the minimum element lies in the right half of the array, so we set low to mid + 1.
3. If nums[mid] is less than nums[high], it means the minimum element lies in the left half of the array, so we set high to mid.
4. If nums[mid] is equal to nums[high], we cannot be certain in which half the minimum element lies, so we simply decrement high by 1.

At the end, the minimum element will be at index low. The solution takes O(log n) time in the average case and O(n) in the worst case.

Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?","To find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array that may contain duplicates, we can use a modified binary search approach. The key idea is to use the properties of the sorted and rotated array to determine which half of the array to search in.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. ** Initialize two pointers **: `left` and `right` to the start and end of the array respectively.
2. ** While `left < right` **:
   - ** Find the middle point **: `mid = (left + right) // 2`.
   - ** Check if the middle element is the minimum **:
     - If `nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]`, then `nums[mid]` is the minimum element.
     - If `nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]`, then the minimum element is in the right half of the array. Update `left` to `mid + 1`.
     - If `nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]`, then we cannot determine which half the minimum element is in based on the middle element alone. In this case, we need to check the entire array, but we can reduce the search space by incrementing `left` by 1.
3. ** When `left == right` **: The minimum element is `nums[left]`.

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

File file( ""abcde `""); // File is  ""`abcde `"", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  ""abcd "", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  ""e "", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  "" "", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The read function may be **called multiple times**.
*   Please remember to **RESET** your class variables declared in Solution, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see [here](https://leetcode.com/faq/) for more details.
*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.
*   It is guaranteed that in a given test case the same buffer `buf` is called by `read`.

sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
Assume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.

    The algorithm uses a buffer `buf4` to store characters read from the `read4` method. We initialize two variables, `buffer_index` to keep track of the current position in `buf4` and `buffer_len` to store the number of characters read from `read4`.

In the `read` method, the first step is to check if we need to read more characters from `read4`. This is done by checking if `buffer_index` is equal to `buffer_len`. If it is, then we call `read4` and reset the `buffer_index` to 0.

If the number of characters read from `read4` is 0, then we have reached the end of the file, so we break out of the loop.

Next, we copy the characters from `buf4` to the destination buffer `buf` until either we have read enough characters (`cnt` equals `n`), or there are no more characters to copy from `buf4` (`buffer_index` equals `buffer_len`). After copying characters, we increment `cnt` and `buffer_index` accordingly.

When the loop is finished, the result is the total number of characters read, which is stored in `cnt`.

   - Create a variable `count` to keep track of the number of characters read so far.

2. **Loop Through Queries:**
   - For each query `n`, we need to read `n` characters from the file.
   - Use the `read4` method to read 4 characters at a time.
   - Update the `count` variable after each call to `read4`.
   - If `count` reaches or exceeds `n`, break out of the loop.

3. **Handle Remaining Characters:**
   - If `count` is less than `n` after reading all possible 4-character blocks, read the remaining characters from the file.
   - Update the `count` variable.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - Return the `count` variable.

    The algorithm implements a sliding window approach. We maintain two pointers `l` and `r` representing the left and right ends of the current substring. We also maintain a hash map `char_count` to store the counts of distinct characters in the current substring.

We iterate through the string with pointer `r`. For each character, we increment its count in the hash map. If we have two or fewer distinct characters in the current substring, we update the current length `cur_len`. If we have more than two distinct characters, we move the pointer `l` to the right, decrementing the count of the character at `l` in the hash map, and removing it if its count becomes zero. We update `cur_len` accordingly in the process.

At each step, we update the maximum length `max_len` with the maximum of `max_len` and `cur_len`. We return `max_len` at the end.

This approach involves maintaining a window of characters that can expand and shrink as we iterate through the string.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `max_length`: This will store the length of the longest valid substring found so far.
   - `left`: This will be the left boundary of the sliding window.
   - `right`: This will be the right boundary of the sliding window.
   - `char_count`: This will be a dictionary to keep track of the count of each character in the current window.

2. **Iterate Through the String:**
   - For each character `s[right]` in the string:
     - Increment the count of `s[right]` in `char_count`.
     - If the number of distinct characters in the window is greater than 2, we need to shrink the window from the left.
       - While the number of distinct characters is greater than 2, decrease the count of `s[left]` in `char_count` and increment `left`.
     - After shrinking the window, update `max_length` with the maximum of the current window length (`right - left + 1`) and the previous `max_length`.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - After iterating through the entire string, `max_length` will contain the length of the longest substring that contains at most two distinct characters.

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

*   `listA` - The first linked list.
*   `listB` - The second linked list.

    The algorithm first checks if the length of string `s` is greater than the length of string `t`. If true, it swaps the two strings and continues the checks. Next, the algorithm checks if the length difference between the strings is greater than 1, returning `false` if so since it's not possible to meet the one edit distance criteria in that case.

The algorithm iterates through the characters of the two strings. If it encounters a mismatched character it checks if the insertion or deletion of a character can yield the other string, and if not, it checks if the replacement of the mismatched character in string `s` can yield string `t`. If it iterates through both strings without finding a mismatch, it returns `true` if the length difference of the strings is 1 to ensure only one character has been inserted. Otherwise, it returns `false`.
    ","Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if they are both one edit distance apart, otherwise return `false`.

A string `s` is said to be one distance apart from a string `t` if you can:

*   Insert **exactly one** character into `s` to get `t`.
*   Delete **exactly one** character from `s` to get `t`.
*   Replace **exactly one** character of `s` with **a different character** to get `t`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""ab "", t =  ""acb ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** We can insert 'c' into s to get t.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  "" "", t =  "" ""
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** We cannot get t from s by only one step.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length, t.length <= 104`
*   `s` and `t` consist of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits.","To determine if two strings `s` and `t` are one edit distance apart, we need to check if we can transform `s` into `t` by performing exactly one of the following operations:

1. Insert a character into `s`.
2. Delete a character from `s`.
3. Replace a character in `s` with a different character.

We can use a two-pointer approach to compare the characters of `s` and `t` and count the number of differences. If the number of differences is exactly 1, then `s` and `t` are one edit distance apart. If the number of differences is more than 1, then `s` and `t` are not one edit distance apart.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:","python
def is_one_edit_distance(s, t):
    # If the lengths of s and t differ by more than 1, they cannot be one edit distance apart.
    if abs(len(s) - len(t)) > 1:
        return False

    # Initialize two pointers to compare the characters of s and t.
    i, j = 0, 0

    # Count the number of differences.
    differences = 0

    # Iterate through the characters of s and t.

        if s[i]!= t[j]:

        else:

    For this problem, we can use the binary search. Instead of comparing the mid-element to the target value, we compare it with its neighbors. Based on the comparison, we adjust the left and right pointers accordingly:

1. Initialize left and right pointer, `left = 0` and `right = nums.length - 1`.
2. While `left < right`, do the following:
   a. Calculate the mid index, `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`.
   b. If `nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]`, move the left pointer to `mid + 1`.
   c. Else, move the right pointer to the `mid`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize the search range:**
   - Set the left index `l` to 0.
   - Set the right index `r` to `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the array.

2. ** Binary search loop:**
   - While `l <= r`, do the following:
     - Calculate the middle index `m` as `l + (r - l) // 2`.
     - Compare the middle element `nums[m]` with its neighbors `nums[m-1]` and `nums[m+1]`.
     - If `m` is a peak element (i.e., `nums[m] > nums[m-1]` and `nums[m] > nums[m+1]`), return `m`.
     - If `nums[m] < nums[m-1]`, then the peak element must be in the left half of the array. Set `r` to `m - 1`.
     - If `nums[m] < nums[m+1]`, then the peak element must be in the right half of the array. Set `l` to `m + 1`.

3. ** handle edge cases:**
   - If the array has only one element, that element is a peak element. Return the index of that element.
   - If the array has two elements, compare them and return the index of the larger element.

1. **Split the version numbers into revisions:**
   - Use the `split` method to split `version1` and `version2` by the dot `.""`.
   - This will give us two lists of strings, where each string is a revision.

2. ** Pad the shorter list with zeros:**
   - Determine the maximum length of the two lists.
   - Pad the shorter list with zeros to make both lists the same length.

3. **Compare the revisions:**
   - Iterate through the padded lists and compare each pair of revisions.
   - If a revision in `version1` is less than the corresponding revision in `version2`, return `-1`.
   - If a revision in `version1` is greater than the corresponding revision in `version2`, return `1`.
   - If all revisions are equal, return `0`.

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, where `left` starts at the beginning of the array (index 0) and `right` starts at the end of the array (index `n-1`).

   - If the sum is equal to the target, return the indices `left+1` and `right+1` (since the indices are 1-indexed).
   - If the sum is less than the target, move the `left` pointer one step to the right (increase `left` by 1).
   - If the sum is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer one step to the left (decrease `right` by 1).

1. We start by initializing an empty string called `result` that will store the final column title.
2. In a while loop, we continue until the `columnNumber` is greater than 0.
3. We subtract 1 from `columnNumber`, as the base representation starts from A (1).
4. The remainder of `columnNumber` divided by 26 is the index of the character in the A-Z range, which is added to the `result` string.
5. `columnNumber` is then divided by 26 and the loop continues until `columnNumber` is 0.

2. **Convert words to individual characters**: Next, we convert the reversed string into a list of characters. This allows us to manipulate each character individually.

3. **Reverse each word**: We then iterate through the list of characters and reverse each word. Since each word is now a list of characters, we can use the `reverse()` method to reverse the order of the characters in each word.

4. **Convert back to a string**: Finally, we convert the list of characters back into a string. This gives us the final reversed order of the words.

This will keep track of the most profitable second transaction after buying a stock at the highest possible profit for the first transaction.

    while n:

```
    
    The algorithm for this problem is straightforward. We use a bitwise AND operation with 1 to check the rightmost bit of the input integer `n`. If the result is 1, then the rightmost bit is a '1', and we increment the `count`. We continue to check the rest of the bits by shifting `n` to the right (`>>` in C++/Python or `>>>` in Java/JavaScript, since Java/JavaScript use signed right shift) to remove the rightmost bit. The loop continues until `n` becomes 0, which means there are no more '1' bits. Finally, we return the `count` of 1 bits.

Note that the '>>>=' unary operator in Java and JavaScript is used to avoid sign extension when shifting right. This ensures that the shift is done in an unsigned manner.
    ","Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Note:**

*   Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
*   In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 3**, the input represents the signed integer. `-3`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The input binary string **00000000000000000000000000001011** has a total of three '1' bits.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The input binary string **00000000000000000000000010000000** has a total of one '1' bit.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
**Output:** 31
**Explanation:** The input binary string **11111111111111111111111111111101** has a total of thirty one '1' bits.

**Constraints:**

*   The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`.

**Follow up:** If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?","To solve the problem of finding the number of '1' bits in the binary representation of an unsigned integer, we can use a simple algorithm that iterates through each bit of the integer and counts the number of '1's. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Convert the integer to its binary representation**: Since the integer is given as a binary string of length 32, we can directly work with the binary string.

2. **Iterate through each bit**: We will loop through each character in the binary string from left to right.

3. **Count the '1's**: For each character in the binary string, if it is '1', we increment a counter.

4. **Return the count**: After iterating through all the bits, we return the counter value, which represents the number of '1' bits in the binary representation.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:","python
def count_ones(n):
    # Convert the integer to its binary representation as a string
    binary_str = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # Initialize a counter for the number of '1's
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each character in the binary string
    for bit in binary_str:
        # If the bit is '1', increment the counter
        if bit == '1':
            count += 1
    
    # Return the count of '1's

The recurrence relation for `dp[i]` can be defined as follows:
- If we do not rob the `i`-th house, then the maximum amount of money we can robust from the first `i` houses is the same as the maximum amount of money we can robust from the first `i-1` houses, i.e., `dp[i] = dp[i-1]`.
- If we rob the `i`-th house, then we cannot rob the `(i-1)`-th house, so the maximum amount of money we can robust from the first `i` houses is the sum of the money in the `i`-th house and the maximum amount of money we can robust from the first `i-2` houses, i.e., `dp[i] = nums[i] + dp[i-2]`.

We need to consider the base cases:
- If `i = 0`, then `dp[0] = 0` (we have not robbed any houses).
- If `i = 1`, then `dp[1] = nums[1]` (we can rob the first house).

    The function uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the binary tree level by level. We use a queue to keep track of nodes at the current level. 

The algorithm starts by adding the root node to the queue. Then, while the queue is not empty, we iteratively process each level. During each iteration, we calculate the size of the current level, then loop through each node of that level. If we reach the last node of the current level, i.e. `(i == level_size - 1)`, we add that node's value to the result list. After processing the current node, we add its left and right children to the queue if they exist. 

After traversing the entire tree, we return the result list. The algorithm is the same for all languages, with the only differences being syntactical.

*   Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1.
*   Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy.

Return `true` _if_ `n` _is a happy number, and_ `false` _if not_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 19
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

def get_next(n):

    while n > 0:
        digit = n % 10
        sum += digit * digit
        n //= 10
    return sum

        slow = get_next(slow)
        fast = get_next(get_next(fast))
    return fast == 1
```
    
    The algorithm to determine if a number is happy repeatedly performs the sum of the squares of its digits. We can use the slow and fast pointer method (also called the Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm). In this method, we have two pointers (`slow` and `fast`), both initially pointing to the input number `n`. In each iteration, the `slow` pointer moves to the next number in the sequence (by calling `getNext()`) while the `fast` pointer moves to the next of next number in the sequence. If at any point, we find that the `fast` pointer becomes 1, it implies that the number is a happy number. If the `slow` and `fast` pointers become equal and it is not 1, it implies that there is a cycle and the number is not a happy number.

`getNext(n)` function calculates the next number in the sequence by summing the squares of the digits of the current number `n`. This function is called in the main `isHappy(n)` function for updating `slow` and `fast` pointers.

- First, create a sentinel node to handle edge cases for the head node.
- Assign the `next` attribute of the sentinel node to the given head node.
- Set the `prev` pointer to the sentinel node and the `curr` pointer to the head node.
- Loop through the linked list:
  - If the value of the current node matches the given value, remove it by updating the `next` attribute of the previous node.
  - Otherwise, move the `prev` pointer to the current node.
  - Move the `curr` pointer to the next node.
- After the loop, the new head of the linked list is found in the sentinel node's `next` attribute.

Topological sort is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed graph such that for every directed edge \(u \rightarrow v\), vertex \(u\) comes before vertex \(v\) in the ordering. If a topological sort exists, the graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and it is possible to finish all courses.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. ** Create a graph from the prerequisites:**
   - Initialize an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Initialize an array to keep track of the in-degrees (number of incoming edges) of each vertex.

2. ** build the graph and in-degrees:**
   - For each prerequisite pair \([ai, bi]\), add an edge from \(bi\) to \(ai\) in the adjacency list and increment the in-degree of \(ai\).

3. ** Find vertices with in-degree 0:**
   - These vertices have no prerequisites and can be taken first. Add them to a queue.

4. ** Perform topological sort:**
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Remove a vertex from the queue.
     - Add the vertex to the topological order.
     - For each neighbor of the removed vertex, decrease its in-degree by 1.
     - If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.

5. ** Check if all vertices are in the topological order:**
   - If the topological order contains all vertices, it is possible to finish all courses. Otherwise, it is not possible.

    The Trie data structure is implemented as a tree, where each node has a mapping of characters to their corresponding child nodes. Every node also has an `isEndOfWord` flag to indicate if any word ends at this node. 

The `insert` function iterates through each character in a given word, adding new nodes to the tree if they don't already exist, and finally setting the `isEndOfWord` flag to true at the final node.

The `search` function follows the characters from the root of the Trie to the final node, returning false if any character does not map to a child node, otherwise returning the value of the `isEndOfWord` flag at the final node.

The `startsWith` function is similar to `search`, but returns true if a sequence of characters exists in the Trie, regardless of whether a word terminates at the final node.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize Pointers and Variables:**
   - Set two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start of the array.
   - Initialize a variable `min_length` to store the minimal length of the subarray. Set it to `0` initially.
   - Initialize a variable `current_sum` to store the sum of the elements in the current subarray. Set it to `0` initially.

2. **Iterate Through the Array:**
   - Use the `right` pointer to expand the subarray by adding elements to `current_sum`.
   - While `current_sum` is less than the target, move the `right` pointer to the right and add the new element to `current_sum`.
   - Once `current_sum` is greater than or equal to the target, update `min_length` with the length of the current subarray if it is smaller than the current `min_length`.
   - Move the `left` pointer to the right to reduce the size of the subarray and update `current_sum` by subtracting the element at the `left` pointer.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - After iterating through the array, return the `min_length`. If `min_length` is still `0`, it means no subarray meets the condition, so return `0`.

Here's the Python code implementing this algorithm:","python

    This problem can be solved using the Topological Sort algorithm, which works in the following way:

2. Initialize an adjacency list, `adjList`, to store the outgoing courses from a prerequisite course.
3. Fill `adjList` while iterating through the prerequisites array.
4. Create a queue, `q`, and enqueue all the nodes whose in-degree is 0; these nodes represent the starting points in this topological sort.
5. Initialize an array or list called `order` to store the final ordering.
6. While `q` is not empty, perform the following steps:
    - Dequeue the front node `curr`.
    - Append `curr` to the `order`.
    - Iterate through all the outgoing courses (neighbors) of `curr`. For each neighboring node `next`, decrease the in-degree of `next` by 1. If the in-degree of `next` becomes 0, enqueue `next` to `q`.
7. Finally, if the length of the `order` is equal to the total number of courses, return the `order`. Otherwise, return an empty array/list, indicating that it is impossible to finish all the courses.

Topological sort is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed graph such that for every directed edge `u -> v`, vertex `u` comes before `v` in the ordering. This is exactly what we need to do here: order the courses such that each course `ai` comes after all its prerequisites `bi`.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. ** Create a graph from the prerequisites:**
   - Initialize an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Initialize a list to keep track of the in-degrees (the number of incoming edges) for each vertex.

2. ** build the graph and in-degrees:**
   - For each prerequisite pair `[ai, bi]`, add an edge from `bi` to `ai` in the adjacency list and increment the in-degree of `ai`.

3. ** Find all vertices with in-degree 0:**
   - These vertices have no prerequisites and can be taken first. Add them to a queue.

4. ** Perform the topological sort:**
   - While the queue is not empty, do the following:
     - Remove a vertex from the queue.
     - Add this vertex to the result list.
     - For each neighbor of the removed vertex, decrease its in-degree by 1.
     - If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.

5. ** Check if all vertices have been processed:**
   - If the result list has the same length as the number of courses, then all vertices have been processed, and the result list is a valid topological order. Otherwise, it is impossible to finish all courses, and we return an empty list.

When we add a word, we walk through the Trie, creating new child nodes if necessary, and set `is_word` to true for the last Trie node representing the word's last character.

When we search for a word, we use a helper function that takes the current Trie node, the word, and the current position in the word. If the current character in the word is a dot (`.`), we search for any matching character by iterating through all its children, recursively calling the helper function with the next position in the word. If the current character in the word is a lowercase letter, we proceed to the corresponding child node and continue the search.

At any point, if we reach the word's end, we check if the `is_word` of the current Trie node is true. If it is, we found a match. Otherwise, the search continues.

*   `void addWord(word)` Adds `word` to the data structure, it can be matched later.
*   `bool search(word)` Returns `true` if there is any string in the data structure that matches `word` or `false` otherwise. `word` may contain dots `'.'` where dots can be matched with any letter.

\[null,null,null,null,false,true,true,true\]

**Explanation**
WordDictionary wordDictionary = new WordDictionary();

wordDictionary.addWord( ""mad "");
wordDictionary.search( ""pad ""); // return False
wordDictionary.search( ""bad ""); // return True

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= word.length <= 25`
*   `word` in `addWord` consists of lowercase English letters.
*   `word` in `search` consist of `'.'` or lowercase English letters.

*   At most `104` calls will be made to `addWord` and `search`.","To solve this problem, we can use a tree data structure where each node represents a character in a word. Each node will have children corresponding to the possible next characters in the word. When a word is added, we will create a path in the tree corresponding to that word.

If we reached the end of the word, then we know that this word is found in the board.

We will iterate through each cell on the board and check if we can form a word starting from that cell by moving to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) and checking if the word formed is in the list of words.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the DFS function**: The DFS function will take the current position on the board, the current word being formed, and the board itself. It will recursively explore all possible paths from the current position and check if the word formed is in the list of words.

2. **Initialize the result list**: Create an empty list to store all the words found on the board.

3. **Iterate through each cell on the board**: For each cell, check if it is within the bounds of the board and if it has not been used in the current word. If it meets these conditions, add it to the current word and recursively call the DFS function with the new position and the updated word. If the word formed is in the list of words, add it to the result list.

4. **Return the result list**: After iterating through all the cells, return the result list containing all the words found on the board.

                current_comb.pop()

    result = []
    helper(k, n, 0, [], result)
    return result
```

    
    The algorithm is based on a backtracking approach. We use a helper function which takes some parameters: `k` and `n` to limit the combinations, `current` which is the last considered element, `current_comb` which is the current combination being formed, and `result` which is the list of all valid combinations found so far.

We keep updating the current combination and decreasing `k` and `n` accordingly as we call the helper function recursively. When we have `k = 0` and `n = 0`, we know we have reached a valid combination and add it to our result list. To prevent revisiting the same combinations, we make sure that the numbers are considered in increasing order (thus, the current value being picked always starts at `current + 1`).

When backtracking, we remove the last considered element from the current combination so that we can try another combination. Following this approach ensures that we visit every potential combination only once and store it if it is valid.
    ","Find all valid combinations of `k` numbers that sum up to `n` such that the following conditions are true:

*   Only numbers `1` through `9` are used.
*   Each number is used **at most once**.

Return _a list of all possible valid combinations_. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 3, n = 7
**Output:** \[\[1,2,4\]\]
**Explanation:**
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
There are no other valid combinations.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** k = 3, n = 9
**Output:** \[\[1,2,6\],\[1,3,5\],\[2,3,4\]\]
**Explanation:**
1 + 2 + 6 = 9
1 + 3 + 5 = 9
2 + 3 + 4 = 9
There are no other valid combinations.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** k = 4, n = 1
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** There are no valid combinations.
Using 4 different numbers in the range \[1,9\], the smallest sum we can get is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and since 10 > 1, there are no valid combination.

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= k <= 9`
*   `1 <= n <= 60`","To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach. We will start with an empty combination and add numbers from 1 to 9 one by one, ensuring that we do not use any number more than once and that the sum of the current combination does not exceed `n`. If the sum of the current combination equals `n` and we have used exactly `k` numbers, we add the combination to the result list. If the sum exceeds `n` or we have used more than `k` numbers, we backtrack and try the next number.

Here is the Python code to implement this approach:","python

    The algorithm starts by iterating through all the given buildings and creating a list of x-coordinates paired with the height of the buildings, where the left points are negated. We then sort the list of points by x-coordinate. Additionally, we also create a sorted multiset (C++)/TreeSet (Java)/SortedList (Python)/SortedSet (JavaScript) of building heights, initialized with a single 0 height.

Next, we iterate through the sorted points. If the height is negative, meaning it's a left point of a building, we add the absolute value of the height to the heights set. If the height is positive, meaning it's a right point of a building, we remove the height from the heights set.

At each iteration, we compare the current maximum height to the previous maximum height. If the current maximum height is different from the previous maximum height, it means we've reached a key point in the skyline, so we add this x-coordinate and the current maximum height to the skyline result list. 

This algorithm ensures we receive a sorted list of key points in the skyline, without consecutive horizontal lines of equal height.

1. **Divide the buildings into two halves**: recursively find the skyline for the left half and the right half.
2. ** merge the two skylines**: combine the skylines from the left and right halves into a single skyline.

Let's break down the steps in more detail:

### Step 1: Divide the buildings into two halves
We can use a recursive function to divide the buildings into two halves. If the list of buildings has only one building, we return a list containing that building's key points. Otherwise, we find the middle index of the list and divide the list into two sublists.

### Step 2: Merge the two skylines
To merge the two skylines, we need to combine the key points from both skylines while ensuring that there are no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height. We can do this by iterating through the key points of both skylines and comparing their heights.

    The algorithm uses dynamic programming to find the largest square containing only 1's. It starts by creating a 2D table, `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the size of the largest square ending at position (i, j) in the input matrix. The dimensions of `dp` are m+1 and n+1 to accommodate zero-indexing, and all elements are initialized to zero. 

The algorithm iterates through each element in the input matrix. If the current element is 1, it sets the corresponding entry in `dp` to the minimum of the neighboring `dp` values (i.e., the values at top, left, and top-left) plus 1, which represents the size of the current square. The maxSize variable keeps track of the current largest square size, and at the end, the area of the largest square is returned by squaring maxSize.

The recurrence relation for `dp[i][j]` can be defined as follows:
- If `matrix[i][j] == 0`, then `dp[i][j] = 0` because a square cannot exist at this position.
- If `matrix[i][j] == 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is the minimum of the four adjacent cells (top, left, top-left, and left-top) plus 1. This is because the side length of the square at `(i, j)` is limited by the smallest side length of the squares at its adjacent positions.

We will iterate through the matrix and update the `dp` matrix accordingly. The maximum value in the `dp` matrix will give us the side length of the largest square containing only `1`'s. The area of this square will be the square of this maximum value.

For every push operation, we first push the new element into q2, then move all the elements in the q1 to q2, and then swap both queues. The pop and top operations will always operate on q1, which maintains the elements in the reverse order, simulating the LIFO order of a stack. The empty operation simply checks if q1 is empty.

The time complexity for push is O(n), while the time complexities for top, pop, and empty are O(1).
    ","Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (`push`, `top`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyStack` class:

*   `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
*   `int pop()` Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
*   `int top()` Returns the element on the top of the stack.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the stack is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

*   You must use **only** standard operations of a queue, which means that only `push to back`, `peek/pop from front`, `size` and `is empty` operations are valid.
*   Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ ""MyStack "",  ""push "",  ""push "",  ""top "",  ""pop "",  ""empty ""\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 2, 2, false\]

**Explanation**
MyStack myStack = new MyStack();
myStack.push(1);
myStack.push(2);
myStack.top(); // return 2
myStack.pop(); // return 2
myStack.empty(); // return False

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= x <= 9`
*   At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `empty`.
*   All the calls to `pop` and `top` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the stack using only one queue?","To implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues, we can use the following approach:

1. ** push(x) **: To push an element `x` onto the stack, we add it to the back of the first queue.
2. ** top() **: To get the top element of the stack, we need to move all elements from the first queue to the second queue except the last one. The last element in the second queue will be the top element of the stack.
3. ** pop() **: To remove the top element from the stack, we move all elements from the second queue to the first queue except the last one. The last element in the first queue will be the top element, which we then remove.
4. ** empty() **: To check if the stack is empty, we check if both queues are empty.

Here is the Python code for the implementation:","python

    def __init__(self):

    The algorithm uses an iterative approach to perform an in-order traversal of the binary search tree (BST). We make use of a stack to keep track of the visited nodes. Starting with the root node, we traverse the left subtree until we reach the leftmost node, pushing each node onto the stack along the way. 

When we reach a null node, we pop the top of the stack (the leftmost node). This node will be the smallest value in the tree. We continue traversing the right subtrees, decrementing the value of k each time we pop a node from the stack. When the k becomes 0, we return the value of the current node – this is the kth smallest element.

We repeat the traversal until the desired kth smallest element is found. The time complexity is O(H + k) where H is the height of the tree.

    The algorithm checks if the given integer n is a power of two. First, we check if n is a negative number or zero, in which case it cannot be a power of two, so we return false. 

If n is positive, we can use bitwise manipulation to check if it's a power of two. A power of two in binary representation has only one bit set to 1 (e.g., 1: 001, 2: 010, 4: 100, 8: 1000). When we subtract 1 from a power of two, all the bits from the right of the set bit become 1 (e.g., 1-1: 000, 2-1: 001, 4-1: 011, 8-1: 0111). 

By performing bitwise AND operation (n & (n-1)) between n and (n-1), we can check if there is only one bit set in n. If the result is 0, that means there is no overlapping bit between n and (n-1), indicating that n is a power of two; returning true. Otherwise, return false.

When we need to pop or peek the front element, we check if stack2 is empty; if so, pop all elements from stack1 and push them to stack2. The front element of the queue then would be on the top of the stack2. If stack2 is not empty, just pop or peek the top element of stack2.

To check if the queue is empty, we just need to check if both the stacks are empty.

    The algorithm is a recursive depth-first search on the binary tree. It starts from the root and traverses the tree until it finds either of the two nodes, p or q. When it finds one of the nodes, it returns that node up the recursion chain. When both left and right subtrees have returned a non-null value, it means the current node is the lowest common ancestor, because both p and q have been found below the current node. Else, if either the left or the right subtree returns a non-null value, the function returns that value, signaling up the recursion chain that a target node has been found.

1. **Convert the matrix into a single sorted list**: Since the matrix is sorted both row-wise and column-wise, we can convert it into a single sorted list by performing a diagonal traversal. This means we start from the top-left corner and move diagonally down to the right, then move up to the left, and so on.

2. **Perform binary search on the sorted list**: Once we have the sorted list, we can use binary search to find the `target` value. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

    while i < m and j < n:
        sorted_list.append(matrix[i][j])

            i += 1

    The algorithm is a recursive divide-and-conquer approach. It starts by iterating through the `input` string and looks for operators (+, -, *). When an operator is found, the problem is divided into two sub-problems: left and right. These sub-problems are independently solved through recursively calling the `diffWaysToCompute` function with corresponding substrings. 

Each recursion returns a list of possible results for each sub-problem. For each operator, we combine these results by iterating through both lists and performing the corresponding operation (addition, subtraction, or multiplication).

If no operators are present in the input string, a base case is reached, and the current number in the input string is returned as the only result. The recursion ultimately produces a list of all possible results for the original expression by combining results from all sub-problems.

1. **Define the recursive function**: We need a function that takes a string `s` and returns a list of all possible results from computing all different ways to group numbers and operators in `s`.

2. **Base case**: If the string `s` is empty, return an empty list.

3. **Identify the operators**: Iterate through the string `s` to find all the operators. For each operator, split the string into two parts: the part before the operator and the part after the operator.

4. **Recursive calls**: For each operator, recursively call the function on the two parts and combine the results using the operator.

5. **Combine the results**: For each pair of results from the two parts, apply the operator and add the result to the list of results for the entire string.

6. **Return the final list**: After processing all the operators, return the list of all possible results.

It then iterates through the string `t`. For each character in `t`, it checks if the frequency count of that character in the hash table is greater than 0.

If both `index1` and `index2` are not -1 (meaning both words have been found at least once), calculate the absolute difference between the indices and update `minDistance` if the current distance is less than the previous minimum distance.

Return `minDistance` once the loop is done iterating.
    ","Given an array of strings `wordsDict` and two strings that already exist in the array `word1` and `word2`, return _the shortest distance between the occurrence of these two words in the list_.

We will iterate through the array and keep track of the last positions where `word1` and `word2` were found. The distance between these two positions will be the shortest distance between the two words.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize two variables `last_word1` and `last_word2` to -1. These variables will store the last positions of `word1` and `word2` respectively.
2. Iterate through the array `wordsDict`.
3. For each word in the array, check if it is equal to `word1` or `word2`.
4. If the word is equal to `word1`, update `last_word1` to the current index.
5. If the word is equal to `word2`, update `last_word2` to the current index.
6. After updating `last_word1` or `last_word2`, calculate the distance between `last_word1` and `last_word2` as `abs(last_word1 - last_word2)`.
7. Keep track of the minimum distance found so far.
8. After iterating through the entire array, return the minimum distance.

Inside the loop, the code adds the possible pairs of strobogrammatic digits (""1"" + s + ""1"", ""6"" + s + ""9"", ""8"" + s + ""8"", ""9"" + s + ""6"") and for even lengths only, it adds 0s as well (""0"" + s + ""0"").

We can use a recursive approach to generate all strobogrammatic numbers of length `n`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Base Case**: If `n` is 1, the strobogrammic numbers are simply the digits `0`, `1`, and `8`.
2. **Recursive Case**: If `n` is greater than 1, we can build the strobogrammic numbers by considering the first and last digits. The first digit can be `1`, `6`, `8`, or `9` (it cannot be `0` because it would make the number shorter than `n` when rotated). The last digit must be the corresponding digit that swaps with the first digit when rotated. For example, if the first digit is `6`, the last digit must be `9`. The remaining digits in the middle can be any strobogrammic number of length `n-2`.

We will create a helper function that takes two arguments m and n where m represents the remaining length of the number, and n represents the original length of the number. This helper function will return the strobogrammatic numbers of that length as a space-separated string.

In the helper function:

1. If m is 0, we return an empty string.
2. If m is 1, we return ""0 1 8"" representing the single-digit strobogrammatic numbers.
3. If n is 0, we return ""11 69 88 96"" representing the two-digit strobogrammatic numbers.

For each character `a` in the strobogrammatic numbers of length `m-2`:

1. If m is not equal to n, add a '0' in between the characters and concatenate to the result string.
2. Add '1', '6', '8', and '9' in between the characters, and concatenate to the result string.

Then, in the strobogrammaticInRange function, we iterate through the range of lengths from `low` to `high`. For each length, we check if the strobogrammatic number of that length is within the range `[low, high]`, and if it is, we increase the count by 1.

Finally, we return the total count of strobogrammatic numbers within the specified range.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define a function to calculate the shift pattern of a string:**
   - Initialize an array `shifts` of size 26 (for the 26 letters of the English alphabet) with all elements set to 0.
   - Iterate through each character in the string.
   - For each character, calculate its position in the alphabet ( subtract 'a' from the character's ASCII value).
   - Update the `shifts` array by incrementing the value at the position of the current character by 1.
   - Return the `shifts` array.

2. **Group the strings based on their shift patterns:**
   - Create a dictionary to store the shift patterns as keys and the strings as values.
   - Iterate through each string in the `strings` array.
   - Calculate the shift pattern of the current string using the function defined above.
   - If the shift pattern is already a key in the dictionary, add the current string to the corresponding value list.
   - If the shift pattern is not a key in the dictionary, create a new key with the shift pattern and add the current string to the value list.

    The algorithm uses a recursive helper function `helper()`. This helper function takes a TreeNode and it returns a boolean value. This value indicates if the current subtree (rooted at the node) is a unival subtree or not. While doing this, it also updates the count of unival subtrees encountered.

1. If the current node is `null`, it returns `true`. This means that an empty tree is considered  a unival tree.

2. We recursively call the helper function for the left and right nodes of the current node.

3. If both left and right subtrees return `true`, it means that they are both unival subtrees. Then, we check if the current node forms a unival subtree by comparing its value with the left and right child nodes when they are not `null`. If the values are the same, we increment the count and return `true` for the current node.

4. If either of the left or right subtree is not unival, we return `false` for the current node.

Finally, we return the count of unival subtrees found during the traversal of the entire tree.
    ","Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the number of **uni-value**_ _subtrees_.

A **uni-value subtree** means all nodes of the subtree have the same value.

*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`","To solve the problem of finding the number of uni-value subtrees in a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will define a recursive function that checks if a given subtree is uni-value and counts the number of uni-value subtrees in it.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Base Case**: If the root is `None`, it means we have reached a leaf node or an empty tree. In this case, we return 0 because there are no subtrees to consider.

2. **Recursive Case**: If the root is not `None`, we need to check if the left and right subtrees are uni-value and if the root value is the same as the values in its subtrees. If all these conditions are satisfied, we return 1 (for the current subtree) plus the number of uni-value subtrees in the left and right subtrees. Otherwise, we return the number of uni-value subtrees in the left and right subtrees.

2. In the `next()` function, we return the value corresponding to the indices (or iterators) and increment the column (or iterator) by 1.

3. In the `hasNext()` function, we check if we have a valid element and if not, we try to move forward to the next row (or iterator) and reset the column (or iterator) to 0.

If it does, we add the current combination of factors to the result.

To avoid duplicates, we ensure that the next factor in the sequence is greater than or equal to the previous one by passing a ""start"" variable in the helper function. This ensures that we always explore factors in a non-decreasing order.

At each recursive step, we first check if the current value of `n` is divisible by the current factor (i.e., it has no remainder when divided). If it is, we update the path with the current factor and call the helper function with the updated value of `n` divided by the current factor. After the recursive call returns, we remove the last factor from the path to backtrack to the previous level and explore other factors.

    We use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. Initially, if there are no houses to paint, we return 0.

The base case is when `i = 0`. For each color, the cost to paint the first house is simply the cost of that color:
\[ dp[0][0] = costs[0][0] \]
\[ dp[0][1] = costs[0][1] \]
\[ dp[0][2] = costs[0][2] \]

For `i > 0`, the cost to paint the `i`-th house with color `j` is the cost of painting the `i`-th house with color `j` plus the minimum cost of painting the `(i-1)`-th house with a different color. Therefore, we have:
\[ dp[i][0] = costs[i][0] + \min(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2]) \]
\[ dp[i][1] = costs[i][1] + \min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][2]) \]
\[ dp[i][2] = costs[i][2] + \min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1]) \]

After filling in the `dp` array, the minimum cost to paint all houses is the minimum value among `dp[n-1][0]`, `dp[n-1][1]`, and `dp[n-1][2]`.

    The idea is to find the pattern for the single digit that will be the outcome of repeatedly summing up a number's digits. Observe that for numbers 1-9, the single digit outcome is the number itself. For numbers 10-18 (i.e., 1+0, 1+1, 1+2, ..., 1+8), the single digit outcome is 1-9 again. This pattern repeats.

In the given code, we return the value computed from the formula `1 + (num - 1) % 9`. The formula derives from the observation mentioned above. Here's the explanation:

- Subtracting 1 shifts the sequence to range from 0 to 8 instead of 1 to 9.
- Taking num modulo 9 reveals the repeating 0-8 pattern.
- Adding 1 offsets the range back to 1-9.

This algorithm works for all positive integer numbers, and the result is the single digit number that is the outcome of repeatedly summing up the original number's digits.

The digital root of a non-zero integer is the single digit number that is equivalent to the original number modulo 9, with the exception that the digital root of 9 is 9.

1. If the number `num` is 0, return 0.
2. If the number `num` is not 0, find the remainder when `num` is divided by 9. If the remainder is 0, return 9. Otherwise, return the remainder.

3. **Fix the first element**: For each \(i\), we fix the first element of the triplet as \(nums[i]\).

4. **Use two pointers**: We use two pointers, \(j\) and \(k\), to find the other two elements of the triplet. We start with \(j = i+1\) and \(k = n-1\). We then move the pointers based on the sum of the elements at these positions:
   - If \(nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target\), then all pairs \((j, k)\) will form a valid triplet with \(i\). So, we add the number of valid pairs to our result and move \(j\) to the right.
   - If \(nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] \ge target\), then we move \(k\) to the left.

Then, we find the rightmost bit that is set to 1 in this XOR result. This bit will be different for the two unique numbers.

Next, we split the numbers into two groups: one group has that bit set, and the other group doesn't. XOR all numbers in both groups separately, and the result of the XOR operation for each group will be one of the unique numbers. This is because, within each group, the equal numbers will cancel themselves out, leaving the unique numbers as the result.

The XOR of a number with itself is 0, and the XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself. Therefore, if we XOR all the elements in the array, the result will be the XOR of the two unique elements, since all the other elements will cancel each other out.

Let's denote the two unique elements as `a` and `b`. Then, we have:
\[ a \oplus b = \text{XOR of all elements in the array} \]

We can use this bit to divide the elements into two groups: those with the bit set and those without the bit set. Since `a` and `b` have different values for this bit, they will be in different groups.

5. If all nodes have not been visited, return false.
6. If there is no cycle and all nodes have been visited, return true.

The 'hasCycle' function checks for the cycle recursively. When visiting a node, mark it as visited. For each neighbor of the current node, if the neighbor is not the parent and has been visited, return true as a cycle is found. If the neighbor is not visited, call the 'hasCycle' function recursively. If the recursion returns true, a cycle has been found. Else, return false as no cycle is found in the current neighbors.
    ","You have a graph of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given an integer n and a list of `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the graph.

Return `true` _if the edges of the given graph make up a valid tree, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, edges = \[\[0,1\],\[0,2\],\[0,3\],\[1,4\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= edges.length <= 5000`
*   `edges[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= ai, bi < n`
*   `ai != bi`
*   There are no self-loops or repeated edges.","To determine if the given edges form a valid tree, we need to check two conditions:
1. The graph is connected.
2. The graph has no cycles.

We can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to check these conditions. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize a visited array**: This array will keep track of the nodes that have been visited during the DFS.
2. ** Initialize a parent array**: This array will keep track of the parent of each node in the DFS tree. The parent of a node is the node from which it was visited.
3. **Perform DFS from each unvisited node**: Start the DFS from each node that has not been visited yet. During the DFS, mark each node as visited and set its parent.
4. **Check for cycles**: If we encounter a node that is already visited and is not the parent of the current node, then there is a cycle in the graph.
5. **Check for connectivity**: If there is any node that has not been visited after performing DFS from all nodes, then the graph is not connected.

Here is the Python code to implement this approach:","python

    The algorithm uses the topological sorting algorithm with an adjacency list to represent the directed graph. The directed graph's vertices represent each unique character from the words array, and a directed edge between two vertices indicates that the first character appears before the second character in the alien language's dictionary.

It first initializes an adjacency list `graph`, an in-degree HashMap `inDegree` to store the in-degree of each character, and fills the HashMap with the unique characters from the words array, setting the initial in-degree of each character to 0. Then, it iterates through adjacent word pairs from the `words` array and adjacent character pairs from those word pairs, checking if they form an edge in the graph (i.e., the characters are different). If an edge is found, it is added to the graph, and the in-degree of the second character in the pair is incremented. In case we traverse through equal characters and later find the second string is shorter, we return an empty string as this indicates an invalid order.

To find the lexicographical order, we can use the topological sorting algorithm. We initialize a queue to store the characters with an in-degree of 0 (i.e. they have no incoming edges) and perform the following steps until the queue is empty:

1. Pop the front character from the queue and append it to the result string.
2. Iterate over all the neighbors of the popped character in the graph.
3. Decrement the in-degree of each neighbor.
4. Check if the in-degree of the neighbor is 0; if it is, push the character onto the queue.

Finally, if the length of the result string is less than the number of unique characters, return an empty string as it indicates there's no valid lexicographical order. Otherwise, return the result string.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the letters and their dependencies:**
   - Create a set `letters` to store all unique letters in the words.
   - Create a dictionary ` depends` to store the dependencies between letters. The key is a letter, and the value is a list of letters that depend on it.

2. **弹珠 the dependencies:**
   - For each word in the list, iterate through its letters and add dependencies. If a letter appears before another letter in the word, add the letter that appears later to the list of dependencies of the letter that appears earlier.

3. **Perform topological sort:**
   - Use a topological sort algorithm to determine the order of the letters. Start with letters that have no dependencies and add them to a queue. Remove a letter from the queue and add its dependents to the queue.

4. **Check for cycles:**
   - If there are any cycles in the dependencies, there is no valid order for the letters. Return an empty string.

5. **Construct the result:**
   - If there are no cycles, return the order of the letters as a string.

When decoding, the receiving side searches for the delimiter and extracts the string's length just before each delimiter. It then uses that length to extract the original string extending from the position after the delimiter. It iterates over the received encoded string until all substrings have been extracted.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Convert the BST to an In-Order List:**
   Perform an in-order traversal of the binary search tree to convert it into a sorted list. This is because the in-order traversal of a binary search tree yields a sorted sequence of its elements.

2. **Find theIndex of the Target Value:**
   Use binary search to find the index of the target value in the sorted list. If the target value is not found, find the index where it would be if it were inserted into the list.

3. **Determine the Range of indices:**
   Once we have the index of the target value, we need to determine the range of indices in the sorted list that are within the `k` closest values to the target. This range will be centered around the index of the target value.

4. **Extract the k Closest Values:**
   Extract the `k` values from the sorted list based on the determined range of indices.

Let's implement this approach in Python:","python

        in_order_traversal(node right)
    in_order_traversal(root)

    # Step 2: Find the index of the target value
    index = bisect(in_order_list, target)

    # Step 3: Determine the range of indices
    left_index = max(0, index - k // 2)
    right_index = min(len(in_order_list) - 1, index + k // 2)

    # Step 4: Extract the k closest values

    The algorithm is based on binary search. The idea is to find the pivot index 'mid' such that there are 'mid' number of elements greater than or equal to 'mid'. Since the array is sorted, we can leverage binary search by comparing the middle element's value to the number of elements on its right side (which can be calculated as 'n - mid'). If the number of elements on the right side is equal to the value at mid, we found the h-index. Otherwise, if the number of elements on the right side is less than the value at mid, we move our search to the left half of the array. If the number of elements is greater than the value at mid, we move our search to the right half of the array. This process ensures logarithmic time complexity as we eliminate half of the array in each iteration. Once our search is complete (right becomes less than left), we return the final h-index as 'n - left'.

The h-index is the maximum value of \( h \) such that the researcher has published at least \( h \) papers that have each been cited at least \( h \) times.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. ** Initialize the search range:**
   - The lower bound \( \text{low} \) is 0.
   - The upper bound \( \text{high} \) is the length of the citations array.

2. ** Binary search:**
   - While \( \text{low} \leq \text{high} \):
     - Calculate the middle index \( \text{mid} \) as \( \text{mid} = \frac{\text{low} + \text{high}}{2} \).
     - Check if the researcher has at least \( \text{mid} \) papers with at least \( \text{mid} \) citations each.
       - If \( \text{citations}[\text{mid} - 1] \geq \text{mid} \), then the researcher has at least \( \text{mid} \) papers with at least \( \text{mid} \) citations each. Set \( \text{low} = \text{mid} + 1 \).
       - If \( \text{citations}[\text{mid} - 1] < \text{mid} \), then the researcher does not have at least \( \text{mid} \) papers with at least \( \text{mid} \) citations each. Set \( \text{high} = \text{mid} - 1 \).

3. ** Return the result:**
   - After the binary search, the h-index is \( \text{high} \).

    We start with two cases when n equals to 0 or 1.
If n equals 0, it means there are no posts, so the result will be 0.
If n equals 1, it means there is only one post and k colors to choose from, so the result will be k.

After that, we create two variables: `same` and `different`. `same` stores the number of ways to color a fence at position i, such that the color of post i is the same as that of post i-1. `different` stores the number of ways to color the post at position i, such that the color of post i is different from that of post i-1.

For the first two posts, there are k ways to paint them the same color, and k*(k-1) ways to paint them different colors.

Then we use a loop starting from the third post (i=2) to the last post (i=n-1).
At each iteration, we update `different` by adding the previous `same` and `different` values and multiply by (k-1). This is because for different colors, they can either come from previous same colors or different colors, hence the addition. And then we multiply it by (k-1) to consider all possible color combinations excluding the previous color. After that, we update `same` by the previous `different` value, because now we need to consider the current post having the same color as the previous post.

Finally, we return the total number of ways which is the sum of `same` and `different`.

Let's define \( dp[i][j] \) as the number of ways to paint the first \( i \) posts such that the \( i \)-th post is painted with color \( j \).

The base cases are:
- For \( i = 1 \), any of the \( k \) colors can be used, so \( dp[1][j] = 1 \) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( k \).
- For \( i = 2 \), any of the \( k \) colors can be used for the second post, so \( dp[2][j] = k \) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( k \).

For \( i \geq 3 \), the \( i \)-th post can be painted with color \( j \) if the \((i-1)\)-th post is painted with a different color or the \((i-2)\)-th post is painted with a different color than the \((i-1)\)-th post. Therefore, we have:
\[ dp[i][j] = \sum_{l \neq j} dp[i-1][l] + \sum_{l \neq j} dp[i-2][l] \]
This can be simplified to:
\[ dp[i][j] = (k-1) \cdot (dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-2][j]) \]

However, a more efficient way to compute this is to use the following recurrence relation:
\[ dp[i] = (k-1) \cdot (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) \]

You are given a helper function `bool knows(a, b)` that tells you whether `a` knows `b`. Implement a function `int findCelebrity(n)`. There will be exactly one celebrity if they are at the party.

Return _the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity at the party_. If there is no celebrity, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[1,1,0\],\[0,1,0\],\[1,1,1\]\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph\[i\]\[j\] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph\[i\]\[j\] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[1,0,1\],\[1,1,0\],\[0,1,1\]\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There is no celebrity.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == graph.length == graph[i].length`
*   `2 <= n <= 100`
*   `graph[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
*   `graph[i][i] == 1`

**Follow up:** If the maximum number of allowed calls to the API `knows` is `3 * n`, could you find a solution without exceeding the maximum number of calls?","To find the celebrity in a party with \( n \) people, we can use a divide-and-conquer approach. The key idea is to use the `knows` function to compare pairs of people and eliminate those who are not celebrities. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Divide the people into two groups**: If \( n \) is even, divide the people into two groups of size \( \frac{n}{2} \). If \( n \) is odd, divide the people into one group of size \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \) and one group of size \( \left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil \).

2. **Recursively find the celebrity in each group**: Use the `knows` function to determine if there is a celebrity in each group. If there is a celebrity in both groups, then the celebrity must be the one who knows the other. If there is a celebrity in only one group, then the celebrity is in that group.

3. **Combine the results**: If there is a celebrity in both groups, then the celebrity must be the one who knows the other. If there is a celebrity in only one group, then the celebrity is in that group.

4. **Base case**: If \( n = 1 \), then the only person is the celebrity.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:","python

```

    
    The algorithm used here is a binary search approach which starts with the range from the first to the last version. In each iteration, it takes the middle point and checks if it's a bad version by calling `isBadVersion()` API.

If the middle version is bad, this means that the first bad version is either the middle version or somewhere on the left side of the range. So, we update the right end of the range to the middle version.

If the middle version is not bad, the first bad version must be somewhere on the right side of the range. So, we update the left end of the range to the middle version + 1.

The loop will continue until the left and right pointers converge, indicating that we have found the first bad version. As a result, we return the value of the left pointer.

This algorithm has a complexity of O(log n), as it reduces the search range by half at each iteration hence minimizing the number of calls to the API.

1. ** Initialize the search range:**

   - Set the last version `right = n`.

2. **Perform binary search:**
   - While `left < right`, do the following:
     - Calculate the middle version `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`.
     - If `isBad Version(mid)` returns `true`, the first bad version is in the right half of the range. Set `left = mid + 1`.
     - If `isBad Version(mid)` returns `false`, the first bad version is in the left half of the range. Set `right = mid`.

We iterate through the DP array from index `1` to index `n`, inclusive. For each index `i`, we iterate through all perfect square numbers `j * j` smaller than or equal to `i` to find the least number of perfect square numbers that sum up to `i`. We update the `dp` array with the minimum value of the current value at `dp[i]` and `dp[i - j * j] + 1`.

3. **Update the DP Array:**
   - For each `i`, iterate through all perfect squares `j * j` such that `j * j <= i`.
   - Update `dp[i]` by taking the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - j * j] + 1`.

1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start of vectors `v1` and `v2` respectively.
2. Use a boolean variable `turn` to keep track of whether we should return an element from `v1` or `v2`. Initially, set `turn` to `True` to start with `v1`.

    helper(num, target, 0, 0, 0, """")
    return res
```

    
    The algorithm is based on a backtracking approach. We initialize a helper function with the initial parameters, such as the starting position, expression, and running sum. The helper function is then called recursively for each possible operator insertion. When the position reaches the end of the input string, we check if the running sum equals the target. If it does, we add the current expression to the result.

We use these parameters in the helper function:

- `pos`: The current position in the input string
- `currVal`: The current value of the expression up until this point
- `prevVal`: The value before the last operator we inserted
- `currExpr`: The expression string that we are building up

To avoid leading zeros in operands, we use a check to terminate the loop if we encounter a zero at the start.

Inside the helper function, we iterate over the possible next positions ('i') in the input string and decide which operation to perform at the current position:

1. Base case: When the current position is 0, we simply update the current value and expression with no operator.
2. Addition: We update the current value by adding the parsed value, and append ""+"" followed by the substring to the expression.
3. Subtraction: We update the current value by subtracting the parsed value, and append ""-"" followed by the substring to the expression.
4. Multiplication: We update the current value by first subtracting the previous value, then adding the product of the previous value and the parsed value, and append ""*"" followed by the substring to the expression.

After the helper function iterates through all possibilities, we return the result as a list of expressions that evaluate to the target value.
    ","Given a string `num` that contains only digits and an integer `target`, return _**all possibilities** to insert the binary operators_ `'+'`_,_ `'-'`_, and/or_ `'*'` _between the digits of_ `num` _so that the resultant expression evaluates to the_ `target` _value_.

Note that operands in the returned expressions **should not** contain leading zeros.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num =  ""123 "", target = 6
**Output:** \[ ""1\*2\*3 "", ""1+2+3 ""\]
**Explanation:** Both  ""1\*2\*3 "" and  ""1+2+3 "" evaluate to 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num =  ""232 "", target = 8
**Output:** \[ ""2\*3+2 "", ""2+3\*2 ""\]
**Explanation:** Both  ""2\*3+2 "" and  ""2+3\*2 "" evaluate to 8.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** num =  ""3456237490 "", target = 9191
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** There are no expressions that can be created from  ""3456237490 "" to evaluate to 9191.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num.length <= 10`
*   `num` consists of only digits.
*   `-231 <= target <= 231 - 1`","To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to generate all possible expressions by inserting the binary operators `+`, `-`, and `*` between the digits of the string `num`. We will then evaluate each expression to check if it equals the target value.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define a recursive function** `find_expressions` that takes the current index `i` in the string `num`, the current expression `expr`, and the current value of the expression `val`.
2. **Base Case**: If the current index `i` is equal to the length of the string `num`, check if the current expression `expr` evaluates to the target value. If it does, add `expr` to the list of solutions.
3. **Recursive Case**: For each index `i`, iterate through the possible binary operators `+`, `-`, and `*`. Update the expression `expr` and the value `val` accordingly, and make a recursive call to `find_expressions` with the next index `i+1`.

Here is the Python code for the solution:","python
import re

def find_expressions(num, target):
    def evaluate_expression(expr):
        return eval(expr)

    def generate_expressions(i, expr, val):

            return

        # Try inserting each binary operator
        for operator in ['+', '-', '*']:
            new_expr = expr + operator + num[i]

    The PeekingIterator class implements an iterator that supports the peek operation in addition to the regular hasNext and next methods. The constructor takes an existing iterator or iterable object, and initializes the class variables for keeping track of the next value and the internal iterator.

The peek method returns the next value in the sequence, without advancing the internal iterator. The next method returns the next value in the sequence and advances the internal iterator by calling its next method. The hasNext method checks if there are more elements left in the sequence by checking if the internal iterator's next value is not the end.

In all these implementations:

- C++ implementation uses the STL iterator standards and a vector iterator as input
- Java implementation uses the Iterator interface and expects an iterator of any collection implementing Iterable
- Python implementation accepts any iterable object as the input.
- JavaScript implementation assumes given input iterable supports the iterator protocol

While the queue is not empty, we loop through all the gates in the queue, and for each gate, we explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right) and check if they are empty rooms. If they are, we update their distance to be 1 more than the current gate's distance, and add these neighbors to the queue. Once a room's distance is updated, it will not be updated again because that's the shortest distance found. The process continues until all reachable empty rooms have their distances updated.

This algorithm operates in O(m*n) time complexity, where m and n are the dimensions of the grid rooms, since each cell is visited once.

1. **Initialize the BFS queue**: Start by adding all the gates (positions with value `0`) to a queue.
2. **mn**: Keep track of the dimensions of the grid.
3. **Distance array**: Create a new 2D array `dist` of the same dimensions as `rooms` to store the distances from each room to the nearest gate. Initialize all distances with `2147483647` ( infinity).
4. **BFS loop**: While the queue is not empty, do the following:
   - Pop a position `(x, y)` from the queue.
   - Update the distance of the current position with the minimum distance found so far.
   - Check the neighboring positions (up, down, left, right) and if they are within the grid and have not been visited yet (i.e., their distance is still `2147483647`), update their distances and add them to the queue.

1. Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both initially pointing to the first element of the array.
2. Loop through the array, updating `slow` to point to the next element and `fast` to point to the element after the next element, until they meet.
3. Reset `slow` to the first element of the array and keep `fast` at the meeting point.
4. Loop through the array, updating `slow` and `fast` to point to the next element until they meet again. This meeting point is the duplicate number.

*   Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?","To solve the problem of finding the repeated number in an array `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive, we can use the following approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have an array `nums` of length `n + 1`.
   - Each element in `nums` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive.
   - There is exactly one repeated number in `nums`.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - Since there are `n + 1` elements in `nums` and only `n` distinct numbers (from 1 to `n`), by the pigeonhole principle, at least one number must appear more than once.

3. ** Approach:**
   - We can use the properties of the array to find the repeated number without modifying the array and using only constant extra space.
   - One effective method is to use the **XOR** operation.

4. **Using XOR:**
   - The XOR operation has the property that `a XOR a = 0` and `a XOR 0 = a`.
   - We can XOR all the elements in `nums` and then XOR the result with all the numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - The result will be the repeated number because all other numbers will cancel out.

5. **Step-by-Step Solution:**
   - Initialize a variable `x` to 0.
   - Iterate through each element in `nums` and XOR it with `x`.
   - Iterate through each number from 1 to `n` and XOR it with `x`.
   - The final value of `x` will be the repeated number.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:","python
def find_repeated_number(nums):
    n = len(nums) - 1

    The algorithm first initializes the class by storing the words into a hash map with their abbreviations as keys and a set containing the words with this abbreviation as the value. This allows for efficient lookups and eliminates duplicates in the `dictionary`.

Then, it checks whether the abbreviation is not present in the hash map or whether the abbreviation is present with only one word (the same as the input word) in the set. If either of these conditions is met, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

The `get_abbreviation` function returns the abbreviated version of a given `word`. If the length of the `word` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns the `word` itself; otherwise, it returns the first character, the number of characters between the first and last characters, and the last character of the `word` as a string.

    The algorithm uses a recursive depth-fisrt search approach (backtracking) for solving the string matching problem. For each character in the `pattern`, it'll check if the character exists in the `pattern_map`. If it exists and it maps to the string at the current position in `s`, it'll continue checking the remaining patterns and characters in `s`. If it doesn't exist, the function will try to create the mapping of the single character to the substring in `s`. The function will return true if a mapping is found that matches the pattern, else it'll return false. The used mapping is restored (backtracked) in each iteration.

A string `s` **matches** a `pattern` if there is some **bijective mapping** of single characters to strings such that if each character in `pattern` is replaced by the string it maps to, then the resulting string is `s`.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. **Check the lengths of the pattern and the string:**
   If the lengths of the pattern and the string are not equal, it is impossible for the string to match the pattern. This is because a bijective mapping requires that each character in the pattern corresponds to exactly one string in the mapping, and vice versa.

2. **Create a mapping from characters to strings:**
   Iterate through the pattern and the string simultaneously, and map each character in the pattern to the corresponding string in the mapping. If a character in the pattern has already been mapped to a different string, or if a string in the mapping has already been mapped to a different character, then the mapping is not bijective, and the string does not match the pattern.

3. **Check if the mapping is bijective:**
   After iterating through the pattern and the string, check if the mapping is bijective by ensuring that each character in the pattern has been mapped to a unique string, and each string has been mapped to a unique character. If the mapping is not bijective, then the string does not match the pattern.

4. **Replace each character in the pattern with its corresponding string in the mapping:**
   If the mapping is bijective, replace each character in the pattern with its corresponding string in the mapping to form a new string. Check if this new string is equal to the given string `s`. If it is equal, then the string matches the pattern.

The key insight is that the player who faces a heap with a number of stones that is a multiple of 4 will always lose if both players play optimally. This is because the player can only remove 1, 2, or 3 stones, and no matter which number of stones they remove, the opponent can always adjust their move to leave a multiple of 4 stones for the first player.

Let's break down the reasoning:

1. If `n` is a multiple of 4, the first player (you) will always lose. This is because whatever number of stones you remove (1, 2, or 3), the second player can always remove a number of stones to make the total number of stones removed in that round equal to 4. This will leave a multiple of 4 stones for you again, and the process will repeat until there are no stones left.
2. If `n` is not a multiple of 4, the first player (you) can always win. This is because you can remove a number of stones to leave a multiple of 4 stones for the second player. For example, if `n` is 1 more than a multiple of 4 (i.e., `n = 4k + 1`), you can remove 1 stone to leave `4k` stones. If `n` is 2 more than a multiple of 4 (i.e., `n = 4k + 2`), you can remove 2 stones to leave `4k` stones. If `n` is 3 more than a multiple of 4 (i.e., `n = 4k + 3`), you can remove 3 stones to leave `4k` stones. In all these cases, you leave a multiple of 4 stones for the second player, and the second player will lose if both players play optimally.

   We need to find all positions in the string where there are two consecutive `""++""`. We can do this by iterating through the string and checking each pair of adjacent characters.

   For each position where a move can be made, we will flip the two consecutive `""++""` into `""--""`. This will give us a new state of the string. We will store all these new states in a list.

A winning position is one where the player whose turn it is can force a win, and a losing position is one where any move the player makes will leave the opponent in a winning position.

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let's define a function `can_win(current_state)` that returns `True` if the starting player can guarantee a win from the current state, and `False` otherwise.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. **Base Case**: If the current state is empty or has only one character, the starting player cannot make a move, so the starting player loses. Therefore, `can_win("""") = False` and `can_win(""+"") = False`.

2. **Recursive Case**: For a state with more than one character, the starting player can make a move if there are two consecutive `++` in the state. If the starting player makes a move, the state will change to a new state where the two consecutive `++` are replaced with `--`. The starting player will win if the new state is a losing position for the opponent.

3. **Dynamic Programming**: We can use a bottom-up approach to fill in a table of winning and losing states. We start from the smallest states and work our way up to the largest state.

    The algorithm for solving the median in a list of integers works by maintaining two heaps, a max-heap for the left half and a min-heap for the right half. When a new number is added, it is compared to the max value of the left max-heap. If the number is smaller or equal, it is added to the left heap. If the number is larger, it is added to the right min-heap. Then, we balance the two heaps by ensuring that their sizes never differ by more than one. This ensures that the median is always easily accessible as either the largest value in the left heap or the average of the largest value in the left heap and the smallest value in the right heap. The algorithm has an O(log N) time complexity, where N is the number of elements in the list.
    ","The **median** is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

*   For example, for `arr = [2,3,4]`, the median is `3`.
*   For example, for `arr = [2,3]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

Implement the MedianFinder class:

*   `MedianFinder()` initializes the `MedianFinder` object.
*   `void addNum(int num)` adds the integer `num` from the data stream to the data structure.
*   `double findMedian()` returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ ""MedianFinder "",  ""addNum "",  ""addNum "",  ""findMedian "",  ""addNum "",  ""findMedian ""\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[3\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0\]

**Explanation**
MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
medianFinder.addNum(1);    // arr = \[1\]
medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = \[1, 2\]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)
medianFinder.addNum(3);    // arr\[1, 2, 3\]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 2.0

**Constraints:**

*   `-105 <= num <= 105`
*   There will be at least one element in the data structure before calling `findMedian`.
*   At most `5 * 104` calls will be made to `addNum` and `findMedian`.

**Follow up:**

*   If all integer numbers from the stream are in the range `[0, 100]`, how would you optimize your solution?
*   If `99%` of all integer numbers from the stream are in the range `[0, 100]`, how would you optimize your solution?","To solve the problem of finding the median of a data stream, we can use a combination of two Heaps: a Max heap to store the smaller half of the numbers and a Min heap to store the larger half of the numbers. This approach ensures that the median can be found in constant time after each addition.

Here is the step-by-step implementation in Python:

1. **Initialize the Heaps:**
   - Create a Max heap to store the smaller half of the numbers.
   - Create a Min heap to store the larger half of the numbers.

2. **Add a Number:**
   - If the number is less than or equal to the root of the Max heap, add it to the Max heap.
   - If the number is greater than the root of the Max heap, add it to the Min heap.
   - After adding the number, ensure that the sizes of the two Heaps differ by at most 1. If they differ by more than 1, remove the root from the heap that has more elements.

3. **Find the Median:**
   - If the sizes of the two Heaps are equal, the median is the average of the roots of the two Heaps.
   - If the Max heap has more elements than the Min heap, the median is the root of the Max heap.
   - If the Min heap has more elements than the Max heap, the median is the root of the Min heap.

    The algorithm uses a Depth-First Search traversal (specifically, pre-order) to serialize the binary tree into a comma-separated string. Each empty node is represented by a ""null"" string.

To deserialize the data string back into a tree structure, the algorithm processes the comma-separated string and interprets each item it encounters. If the item is ""null"", it sets the node to null. Otherwise, it creates a TreeNode with the value and recursively sets left and right children. The deserialization also uses a pre-order traversal, which corresponds to the serialized string format. This approach ensures that the deserialized tree retains the same structure as the original tree.

It also updates an array `longestPath` that stores the longest path seen so far, allowing multiple levels of the recursive function calls to access and update it.

For each node, the function first calls itself recursively for left and right child nodes. Then, it checks if the left and right children are consecutive values to the current value, and if so, adds the corresponding paths to `currPath`. Finally, it compares `currPath` with the maximum path found so far and updates the `longestPath` array accordingly. The longest consecutive path is returned after the recursion is complete.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

*   The number of ""bulls "", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
*   The number of ""cows "", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

Given the secret number `secret` and your friend's guess `guess`, return _the hint for your friend's guess_.

The hint should be formatted as `""xAyB ""`, where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows. Note that both `secret` and `guess` may contain duplicate digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** secret =  ""1807 "", guess =  ""7810 ""

After iterating through the strings, we loop through the count arrays and add the minimum of the counts of each digit in secret_count and guess_count to the cows count.

Finally, we return the result in the ""xAyB"" format by concatenating the values of bulls and cows.
    ","You are playing the **[Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows)** game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

*   The number of ""bulls "", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
*   The number of ""cows "", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

Given the secret number `secret` and your friend's guess `guess`, return _the hint for your friend's guess_.

The hint should be formatted as `""xAyB ""`, where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows. Note that both `secret` and `guess` may contain duplicate digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** secret =  ""1807 "", guess =  ""7810 ""
**Output:**  ""1A3B ""
**Explanation:** Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
 ""1807 ""
  |
 ""7810 ""

**Example 2:**

**Input:** secret =  ""1123 "", guess =  ""0111 ""
**Output:**  ""1A1B ""
**Explanation:** Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
 ""1123 ""         ""1123 ""
  |      or     |
 ""0111 ""         ""0111 ""
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000`
*   `secret.length == guess.length`
*   `secret` and `guess` consist of digits only.","To solve the problem of determining the hint for the friend's guess in the Bulls and Cows game, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of bulls:**
   - A bull is a digit in the guess that is in the correct position in the secret number.
   - We can iterate through both the secret and the guess and count the number of positions where the digits match.

2. **Count the number of cows:**
   - A cow is a digit in the guess that is in the secret number but is located in the wrong position.
   - We can use a frequency count to determine how many times each digit appears in both the secret and the guess.
   - For each digit that appears in both the secret and the guess, we subtract the number of times it appears as a bull from the total count of that digit in the secret. This gives us the number of cows for that digit.
   - We sum up the cows for all digits to get the total number of cows.

Let's implement this in Python:","python
def bulls_and_cows(secret, guess):
    # Step 1: Count the number of bulls
    bulls = sum(1 for i in range(len(secret)) if secret[i] == guess[i])

    # Step 2: Count the number of cows
    secret_count = {}
    guess_count = {}
    
    # Count the frequency of each digit in the secret
    for digit in secret:
        if digit in secret_count:
            secret_count[digit] += 1
        else:
            secret_count[digit] = 1
    
    # Count the frequency of each digit in the guess
    for digit in guess:
        if digit in guess_count:
            guess_count[digit] += 1
        else:
            guess_count[digit] = 1
    
    cows = sum(min(secret_count[digit], guess_count[digit]) - (1 if secret_count[digit] == guess_count[digit] else 0) for digit in set(secret) | set(guess))

    The algorithm employs dynamic programming to solve the problem. The algorithm initializes an array `dp` of the same length as the input array `nums`, and initializes all its elements with the value 1, indicating that at least a single element can be part of the longest increasing subsequence.

Then, it employs a nested loop to iterate over the input array from the second element onwards. In the inner loop, we compare each element from the 0th index to `i-1` with the current element at `i`. If the current element is greater than the previous element, we update the `dp[i]` value by taking the maximum of the current `dp[i]` value and the `dp[j]` value of the previous element + 1, which indicates the length of the increasing subsequence.

Finally, we update the max_length variable after each outer loop by taking its maximum from the array `dp`. After completing the iterations, we return the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

We will keep track of the number of open parentheses and close parentheses as we iterate through the string. If we encounter a close parentheses before an open parentheses, it means the close parentheses is invalid and we can consider removing it. We will use a recursive function to explore all possible combinations of removing parentheses and check if the resulting string is valid.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Define a function `is_valid(s)` to check if a string `s` is valid. A string is valid if the number of open parentheses is equal to the number of close parentheses and at any point in the string, the number of open parentheses is greater than or equal to the number of close parentheses.
2. Define a function `df(s, open, close, path)` to perform DFS. This function will iterate through the string `s` and for each character, it will either add it to the path if it is an open parentheses or check if it is a close parentheses. If it is a close parentheses and the number of open parentheses is greater than or equal to the number of close parentheses, it means the close parentheses is valid and we can add it to the path. If the close parentheses is invalid, we can consider removing it by not adding it to the path. We will also keep track of the minimum number of removals needed to make the string valid.
3. After the DFS, we will have a list of all valid strings with the minimum number of removals. We will return this list.

    We can preprocess the matrix by creating a 2D array `dp` to store the sum of all elements in the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(i, j)` for each position `(i, j)`. For each position, we can calculate the sum using the previously computed sums: `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i - 1][j - 1] + matrix[i - 1][j - 1]`. This way, we only need to calculate the sum once for each rectangle.

After preprocessing, we can answer the query `sumRegion(row1, col1, row2, col2)` in constant time. The sum of the elements in the query rectangle can be calculated as follows: `dp[row2 + 1][col2 + 1] - dp[row1][col2 + 1] - dp[row2 + 1][col1] + dp[row1][col1]`. This is done by taking the sum of all elements in the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(row2, col2)` and then subtracting the sums of the rectangles from `(0, 0)` to `(row1 - 1, col2)` and from `(0, 0)` to `(row2, col1 - 1)`, and finally adding the sum of the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(row1 - 1, col1 - 1)` to avoid double subtraction.

We will precompute the sum of all elements in the submatrix from the top-left corner to each cell in the matrix. This way, we can answer each `sumRegion` query in constant time by subtracting the appropriate prefix sums.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the prefix sum matrix:**
   - Create a new matrix `prefixSum` of the same dimensions as `matrix`.
   - For each cell `(i, j)` in `prefixSum`, calculate the sum of all elements in the submatrix from \((0, 0)\) to \((i, j)\).

2. **Calculate the prefix sums:**
   - For each row `i` in `matrix`:
     - For each column `j` in `matrix`:
       - If `i` is 0 and `j` is 0, `prefixSum[i][j]` is simply `matrix[i][j]`.
       - If `i` is 0, `prefixSum[i][j]` is the sum of `prefixSum[i][j-1]` and `matrix[i][j]`.
       - If `j` is 0, `prefixSum[i][j]` is the sum of `prefixSum[i-1][j]` and `matrix[i][j]`.
       - Otherwise, `prefixSum[i][j]` is the sum of `prefixSum[i-1][j]`, `prefixSum[i][j-1]`, and `matrix[i][j]` minus `prefixSum[i-1][j-1]` (to avoid double-counting).

3. ** answer the `sumRegion` queries:**
   - For each query with coordinates \((row1, col1, row2, col2)\):
     - The sum of the elements in the rectangle is given by:
       \[
       \text{sum} = \text{prefixSum[row2][col2]} - \text{prefixSum[row2][col1-1]} - \text{prefixSum[row1-1][col2]} + \text{prefixSum[row1-1][col1-1]}
       \]
     - This formula works because it subtracts the areas that are counted twice and adds back the area that was subtracted three times.

    We will use a Union-Find data structure to keep track of the number of distinct islands. Initially, we set all the cells of the grid as water cells which are -1 in the `roots` array.

For each position in `positions`, let's consider it as a new land. We'll increment the island count at this point. If this cell was already processed as land, it is already in the same group or set of lands, so we just push the current island count as part of the result.

Next, we will check and merge the neighboring cells if they are lands. We iterate through 4 possible neighbors (up, down, left, and right) and find their root. If the root of the neighbor is different than the root of the current cell, we merge the sets and decrement island count.

Finally, we push the current island count after processing each position as part of the result.

The time complexity is O(k * log(mn)) as the Union-Find data structure has a log(n) time complexity for find and union operations.

The union find algorithm is an efficient way to maintain a collection of disjoint sets and perform operations such as finding the set to which a given element belongs and merging two sets.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize the Union Find Data Structure:**
   - Create an array `root` of size `m * n` where each element represents the root of a set. Initially, all elements are their own roots.
   - Create an array ` size` of size `m * n` where each element represents the size of the set to which it belongs. Initially, all elements have a size of 1.

2. **Define the Union Function:**
   - The union function takes two roots and合并 their sets.
   - Find the roots of the two given elements using path finding ()bfs).
   - If the roots are different, merge the smaller set into the larger set by changing the root of the smaller set to the root of the larger set.
   - Update the size of the larger set by adding the size of the smaller set.

3. **Define the Path Finding Function:**
   - The path finding function takes a root and returns the root of the set to which it belongs.
   - Use a loop to follow the roots until reach the root of the set.

4. ** Process Each Add Land Operation:**
   - For each operation in `positions`, convert the 2D coordinates \((r, c)\) to a 1D index `i` using the formula `i = r * n + c`.
   - Perform the union operation on the roots of the two adjacent cells (if they are water cells).
   - Update the number of islands by checking if the root of the new land cell is a new root (i.e., it was previously a water cell).

5. **Return the Result:**
   - After processing all operations, return the array of the number of islands after each operation.

The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199.

**Follow up:** How would you handle overflow for very large input integers?","To determine if a given string is an additive number, we need to check if its digits can form an additive sequence. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Define a function to check if a sequence is additive:**
   - We need to ensure that the sequence has at least three numbers.
   - Each subsequent number must be the sum of the preceding two numbers.
   - Numbers in the sequence cannot have leading zeros.

2. **Iterate through possible starting points and lengths of the sequence:**
   - We will try different starting points and lengths to see if we can form a valid additive sequence.

3. **Convert the string to a list of integers:**
   - This will allow us to easily manipulate and check the digits.

4. **Check each possible sequence:**
   - For each starting point and length, check if the sequence formed by the digits is additive.

5. **Return the result:**
   - If we find a valid additive sequence, return `true`.
   - If no valid additive sequence is found, return `false`.

    The algorithm uses a prefix sum array to efficiently answer the range sum queries. The idea is to pre-process the input array by creating an auxiliary array prefixSum, where prefixSum[i] stores the sum of the first i elements. This allows us to compute the sum of elements in a range [left, right] in constant time, by simply returning the difference between prefixSum[right+1] and prefixSum[left]. To generate the prefixSum array, we iterate through the input array nums, and for each element, we add its value to the prefixSum array using the previous prefixSum value.

The time complexity of creating the prefixSum array is O(n) and each range sum query will take O(1) time since we just need to access and subtract two elements in the prefixSum array.

A segment tree is a binary tree where each node represents a range of the array. The root node represents the entire array, and each child node represents a sub-range of the array. This structure allows us to perform range sum queries and update individual elements in logarithmic time.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Initialize the segment tree:**
   - The segment tree will have a size of \(4 \times n\) where \(n\) is the length of the array. This is because each level of the segment tree will have approximately half the number of nodes as the previous level, and the total number of nodes in a complete binary tree with \(n\) leaves is \(2n - 1\). However, we use \(4n\) to ensure that we have enough space for all nodes.
   - Each node in the segment tree will store the sum of the elements in its corresponding range.

2. ** build the segment tree:**
   - Start from the leaves and work up to the root.
   - Each leaf node will store the value of the corresponding element in the array.
   - Each non-leaf node will store the sum of the values of its two child nodes.

3. ** Update an element:**
   - Start from the root and find the leaf node that corresponds to the element to be updated.
   - Update the value of the leaf node.
   - Update the values of all the non-leaf nodes on the path from the leaf node to the root.

4. ** Sum a range:**
   - Start from the root and recursively find the sum of the elements in the range.
   - If the range is completely within the left child's range, return the sum of the left child.
   - If the range is completely within the right child's range, return the sum of the right child.
   - If the range intersects both children's ranges, return the sum of the left child, the right child, and the sum of the elements in the range that is not covered by either child.

    ","A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by _exactly_ one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`) are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs).

Return _a list of all **MHTs'** root labels_. You can return the answer in **any order**.

The **height** of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

The key idea is to calculate the height of each node from its children and then determine the height of the tree when each node is considered as the root.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Convert the edges to an adjacency list**: This will help us to iterate over the children of each node.
2. **Calculate the height of each node from its children**: We start from the leaves and move up to the root. For each node, its height is 1 plus the maximum height of its children.
3. **Determine the height of the tree when each node is the root**: The height of the tree when a node \( x \) is the root is the maximum height of its children plus 1 (the edge from the root to its children).
4. **Find the minimum height**: We keep track of the minimum height and the nodes that achieve this height.
5. **Return the list of all MHTs' root labels**: These are the nodes that have the minimum height when considered as the root.

If two nodes are in the same row and column, the order should be from **left to right**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[3,9,20,null,null,15,7\]
**Output:** \[\[9\],\[3,15\],\[20\],\[7\]\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[3,9,8,4,0,1,7\]
**Output:** \[\[4\],\[9\],\[3,0,1\],\[8\],\[7\]\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = \[3,9,8,4,0,1,7,null,null,null,2,5\]
**Output:** \[\[4\],\[9,5\],\[3,0,1\],\[8,2\],\[7\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`","To solve the problem of finding the vertical order traversal of a binary tree, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach with a queue to keep track of the nodes and their positions. We will use a dictionary to store the nodes' values grouped by their vertical positions.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Initialize a queue** to store the nodes and their positions. Each element in the queue will be a tuple containing the node and its vertical position.
2. ** Initialize a dictionary** to store the nodes' values grouped by their vertical positions.
3. ** Start the BFS from the root node** with a vertical position of 0.
4. ** While the queue is not empty**, do the following:
   - Pop a node and its vertical position from the queue.
   - Add the node's value to the dictionary at its vertical position.
   - Add the left child of the node to the queue with a vertical position decreased by 1.
   - Add the right child of the node to the queue with a vertical position increased by 1.
5. ** Convert the dictionary values to a list of lists** and return it.

Here is the Python code to implement the solution:","python
from collections import deque

def vertical_traversal(root):
    if not root:
        return []

    queue = deque([(root, 0)])

    The algorithm uses a modified merge sort to track the count of smaller elements to the right of each element in the array. The modification is made to merge function. During the merge process, whenever an element from the right side of the array is merged into the sorted subarray (meaning it's smaller than some elements), the count for those elements from the left side of the array is updated by adding the number of elements in the left subarray processed so far. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) due to the merge sort, and space complexity is O(n) for the auxiliary arrays used.

2. Iterate through the string, count the occurrences of each character.
3. Iterate through the string again, decrease the count of the current character.
4. If the current character is visited, continue.
5. While the stack is not empty, the current character is smaller than the top character on stack, and the count of the top character is greater than 0, set the visited of the top character to false and pop the character from the stack.
6. Push the current character onto the stack, and set visited to true.
7. Build the result string from the stack.
