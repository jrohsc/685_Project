So, the problem is about adding two numbers that are represented by linked lists, where each node contains a single digit, and the digits are stored in reverse order. For example, the number 342 is represented as [2, 4, 3], and 465 is represented as [5, 6, 4]. When you add them, you should get 807, which is represented as [7, 0, 8].

First, I need to understand how linked lists work in Python. Each node has a value and a pointer to the next node. I need to traverse both linked lists, add the corresponding digits along with any carry from the previous addition, and create a new linked list for the result.

Let me think about the steps involved:

1. **Initialization:**
   - I need to handle the addition starting from the least significant digit (since the lists are reversed, this is the first digit).
   - I need to keep track of any carry that occurs when the sum of two digits is greater than or equal to 10.
   - I should initialize a dummy head for the result linked list to simplify the creation of the new list.

2. **Traversal and Addition:**
   - I'll traverse both linked lists simultaneously, adding the corresponding digits along with any carry from the previous step.
   - If one list is longer than the other, I'll consider the missing digits as 0.
   - I'll continue this process until both lists are fully traversed and there is no remaining carry.

3. **Creating the Result List:**
   - For each sum calculated, I'll create a new node with the digit value (sum modulo 10) and append it to the result list.
   - I'll update the carry for the next iteration (sum divided by 10).

4. **Return the Result:**
   - Finally, I'll return the next node of the dummy head, which will be the head of the result list.

Let me consider some edge cases:

- If both lists are of length 1, like [0] and [0], the result should be [0].
- If one list is longer than the other, for example, [9,9,9,9,9,9,9] and [9,9,9,9], the result should handle the carry properly, resulting in [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1].

I need to make sure that my code handles these cases correctly.

Also, I need to consider the constraints:

- The number of nodes in each linked list is between 1 and 100.
- Each node contains a digit from 0 to 9.
- The linked lists do not contain any leading zeros, except for the number 0 itself.

Given these constraints, I don't need to handle empty lists or invalid inputs.

Now, let's think about how to implement this in Python.

Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","Alright, I have this problem to solve: given a string, I need to find the length of the longest substring without any repeating characters. For example, in ""abcabcbb"", the longest substring without repeating characters is ""abc"", which has a length of 3.

First, I need to understand what a substring is. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. So, in ""abcabcbb"", ""abc"" is a substring, but ""abcb"" is not because the characters are not contiguous.

My goal is to find the longest such substring where no character appears more than once.

I'll start by considering some examples to get a feel for the problem.

Example 1:

- s = ""abcabcbb""

- Longest substring without repeating characters: ""abc"" -> length 3

Example 2:

- s = ""bbbbb""

- Longest substring without repeating characters: ""b"" -> length 1

Example 3:

- s = ""pwwkew""

- Longest substring without repeating characters: ""wke"" -> length 3

I need to find a way to efficiently find this length.

One straightforward approach is to check all possible substrings and find the one with the maximum length that doesn't have any repeating characters. However, this would be inefficient because for a string of length n, there are n*(n+1)/2 substrings, and checking each one for uniqueness would take additional time.

I need a more efficient method.

I recall that for problems involving substrings with unique characters, the sliding window technique is often useful. The sliding window technique allows us to efficiently find substrings that meet certain criteria by adjusting two pointers that define the window.

In this case, I can use two pointers, let's call them left and right, to represent the current window of characters being considered. I'll start with both pointers at the beginning of the string.

As I move the right pointer to the right, I'll add characters to a set that keeps track of the unique characters in the current window. If a character is already in the set, that means there's a repeating character, so I need to move the left pointer to the right until the repeating character is removed from the set.

At each step, I'll keep track of the maximum length of the window (right - left + 1) where all characters are unique.

This approach should be efficient because each character is visited at most twice: once when the right pointer adds it, and once when the left pointer removes it.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Initialize two pointers, left and right, both starting at 0.

2. Initialize an empty set to store unique characters in the current window.

3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum length found.

4. While the right pointer is within the bounds of the string:

a. If the character at right is not in the set, add it to the set and move the right pointer to the right. Update the maximum length.

b. If the character at right is already in the set, remove the character at the left pointer from the set and move the left pointer to the right.

5. Repeat step 4 until the right pointer has traversed the entire string.

This seems straightforward. Let me test this logic with the first example:

s = ""abcabcbb""

- Initialize left = 0, right = 0, set = {}, max_length = 0

- right=0: 'a' not in set, add 'a', set={'a'}, max_length=1

- right=1: 'b' not in set, add 'b', set={'a','b'}, max_length=2

- right=2: 'c' not in set, add 'c', set={'a','b','c'}, max_length=3

- right=3: 'a' is in set, remove 'a' (left=0), set={'b','c'}, left=1

- right=3: 'a' not in set, add 'a', set={'b','c','a'}, max_length=3

- right=4: 'b' is in set, remove 'b' (left=1), set={'c','a'}, left=2

- right=4: 'b' not in set, add 'b', set={'c','a','b'}, max_length=3

- right=5: 'c' is in set, remove 'c' (left=2), set={'a','b'}, left=3

- right=5: 'c' not in set, add 'c', set={'a','b','c'}, max_length=3

- right=6: 'b' is in set, remove 'b' (left=3), set={'a','c'}, left=4

- right=6: 'b' not in set, add 'b', set={'a','c','b'}, max_length=3

- right=7: 'b' is in set, remove 'b' (left=4), set={'a','c'}, left=5

- right=7: 'b' not in set, add 'b', set={'a','c','b'}, max_length=3

So, the maximum length is 3, which matches the expected output.

Let's try the second example:

s = ""bbbbb""

- left=0, right=0, set={'b'}, max_length=1

- right=1: 'b' in set, remove 'b' (left=0), set={}, left=1

- right=1: 'b' not in set, add 'b', set={'b'}, max_length=1

- right=2: 'b' in set, remove 'b' (left=1), set={}, left=2

- right=2: 'b' not in set, add 'b', set={'b'}, max_length=1

- Continue similarly for the rest, max_length remains 1

Good, that works.

Now, the third example:

s = ""pwwkew""

- left=0, right=0, set={'p'}, max_length=1

- right=1: 'w' not in set, add 'w', set={'p','w'}, max_length=2

- right=2: 'w' is in set, remove 'p' (left=0), set={'w'}, left=1

- right=2: 'w' is still in set, remove 'w' (left=1), set={}, left=2

- right=2: 'w' not in set, add 'w', set={'w'}, max_length=1

- right=3: 'k' not in set, add 'k', set={'w','k'}, max_length=2

- right=4: 'e' not in set, add 'e', set={'w','k','e'}, max_length=3

- right=5: 'w' is in set, remove 'w' (left=2), set={'k','e'}, left=3

- right=5: 'w' not in set, add 'w', set={'k','e','w'}, max_length=3

So, the maximum length is 3, which matches the expected output.

This seems to work for these examples. Now, I need to consider edge cases.

Edge Case 1:

s = """"

- Empty string, so the length is 0.

Edge Case 2:

s = "" ""

- String with a single space, length is 1.

Edge Case 3:

s = ""au""

- ""a"" and ""u"" are both unique, so length is 2.

Edge Case 4:

s = ""aab""

- Substrings: ""a"", ""aa"", ""aab"" -> longest without repeating is ""ab"", length 2.

Wait, according to my sliding window approach:

- left=0, right=0, set={'a'}, max_length=1

- right=1: 'a' is in set, remove 'a' (left=0), set={}, left=1

- right=1: 'a' not in set, add 'a', set={'a'}, max_length=1

- right=2: 'b' not in set, add 'b', set={'a','b'}, max_length=2

Yes, correctly gives 2.

Another Edge Case:

s = ""dvdf""

- Substrings: ""d"", ""v"", ""df"" -> longest is ""vdf"", length 3.

Wait, according to my approach:

- left=0, right=0, set={'d'}, max_length=1

- right=1: 'v' not in set, add 'v', set={'d','v'}, max_length=2

- right=2: 'd' is in set, remove 'd' (left=0), set={'v'}, left=1

- right=2: 'd' not in set, add 'd', set={'v','d'}, max_length=2

- right=3: 'f' not in set, add 'f', set={'v','d','f'}, max_length=3

So, correctly gives 3.

Seems solid.

Now, I need to implement this in code.

I'll use a set to keep track of unique characters in the current window.

I'll initialize left and right pointers at 0, and traverse the string by moving the right pointer.

If a character is already in the set, I'll move the left pointer to the right while removing characters from the set until the repeating character is removed.

At each step, I'll update the maximum length.

I need to handle the case where the string is empty or has only one character.

Also, need to make sure that the indices don't go out of bounds.

Let me start writing the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string `s`. 

### Approach
1. **Sliding Window Technique**: We use a sliding window approach with two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window of characters being considered.
2. **Set for Unique Characters**: A set is used to keep track of unique characters in the current window.
3. **Expand and Contract the Window**:
   - Move the `right` pointer to the right, adding characters to the set if they are not already present.
   - If a character is already in the set, move the `left` pointer to the right until the repeating character is removed from the set.
4. **Track Maximum Length**: At each step, keep track of the maximum length of the window where all characters are unique.

The arrays are already sorted, which is a key point for achieving this time complexity.

First, I need to understand what a median is. The median of a sorted array is the middle element if the array has an odd number of elements, or the average of the two middle elements if the array has an even number of elements.

Since we have two sorted arrays, one straightforward way is to merge them into one sorted array and then find the median. However, merging two sorted arrays takes O(m + n) time, which doesn't meet the required O(log(m+n)) time complexity.

To achieve O(log(m+n)), I need to use a more efficient approach, possibly involving binary search. Given that both arrays are sorted, I can consider a partitioning approach where I partition both arrays such that all elements in the left partitions are less than or equal to all elements in the right partitions, and the partitions are balanced in size.

Let's formalize this approach:

1. **Partitioning:** I need to partition both arrays such that the left partition contains the smaller half of the elements, and the right partition contains the larger half. The number of elements in the left partition should be equal to the total number of elements divided by 2 (considering both arrays).

2. **Binary Search on Partition Sizes:** I can perform a binary search on the possible partition sizes in one of the arrays, and adjust the partition size in the other array accordingly.

3. **Correct Partitioning Condition:** Ensure that the largest element in the left partition is less than or equal to the smallest element in the right partition.

4. **Finding the Median:** Once the correct partitions are found, the median can be determined by looking at the maximum of the left partitions and the minimum of the right partitions.

Let's consider array nums1 of size m and nums2 of size n, assuming m <= n to simplify the binary search.

Steps in Code:

- Ensure nums1 is the smaller array. If not, swap nums1 and nums2.
- Perform binary search on nums1 to find the correct partition.
- Calculate the partition in nums2 based on the partition in nums1.
- Adjust the partition positions based on the comparison of elements at the partition boundaries.
- Once the correct partitions are found, calculate the median based on whether the total number of elements is odd or even.

Edge Cases to Consider:

- One array is empty.
- All elements in one array are smaller or larger than the other array.
- Arrays with duplicate elements (though the problem constraints don't specify unique elements, but median calculation should handle duplicates correctly).

Let's proceed to implement this approach in code.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the median of two sorted arrays efficiently, ensuring that the time complexity is `O(log(m+n))`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two arrays.

### Approach

1. **Partitioning Strategy**:
   - We use a binary search approach to partition the two arrays such that the left partitions contain smaller elements and the right partitions contain larger elements.
   - The partitions should be such that all elements in the left partitions are less than or equal to all elements in the right partitions, and the partitions are as equal as possible in size.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - Assume `nums1` is the smaller array to optimize the search.
   - Perform binary search on `nums1` to find the correct partition point.
   - Calculate the corresponding partition point in `nums2` based on the total number of elements.

3. **Correct Partition Conditions**:
   - Ensure that the elements at the partition boundaries satisfy the condition that the largest element in the left partition is less than or equal to the smallest element in the right partition.

4. **Calculate Median**:
   - If the total number of elements is odd, the median is the maximum of the left partitions.
   - If even, the median is the average of the maximum of the left partitions and the minimum of the right partitions.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. Our task is to identify the longest substring of `s` that satisfies this property.

### Approach

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - Check all possible substrings of `s` and verify if they are palindromes.
   - Keep track of the longest palindrome found.
   - This approach is straightforward but inefficient, with a time complexity of O(n^3), which is not suitable for strings of length up to 1000.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Use a 2D table to store results of subproblems and avoid redundant computations.
   - This approach can reduce the time complexity to O(n^2), which is more efficient.

3. **Expand Around Center Approach:**
   - Consider each character (and each pair of characters for even-length palindromes) as potential centers of palindromes and expand around them to find the maximum length palindrome.
   - This approach also achieves O(n^2) time complexity and is efficient for this problem.

4. **Manacher's Algorithm:**
   - This is an optimized linear time algorithm to find the longest palindromic substring.
   - It is more complex to implement but provides the best time complexity of O(n).

Given the constraints (1 <= s.length <= 1000), the Expand Around Center approach is a good balance between efficiency and implementation complexity.

The function needs to follow specific steps to parse the string and handle various edge cases.

First, I need to understand the steps outlined in the problem:

1. **Ignore leading whitespace:** I have to skip any spaces at the beginning of the string.

2. **Check for a sign:** After skipping whitespace, if the next character is a '+' or '-', I need to read it to determine the sign of the integer. If neither is present, assume the integer is positive.

3. **Read digits:** After the optional sign, I should read in the digits until I encounter a non-digit character or reach the end of the string.

4. **Convert to integer:** Convert the read digits into an integer and apply the sign if necessary.

5. **Handle overflow:** If the integer is outside the 32-bit signed integer range (`-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`), clamp it to the range limits.

6. **Return the result:** Return the final integer value.

I need to make sure that I handle all possible edge cases, such as strings with no digits, strings with leading digits followed by non-digit characters, and strings that represent numbers outside the integer range.

Let me think about the implementation step by step.

**Step 1: Ignore leading whitespace**

I can use Python's `lstrip()` function to remove leading whitespace characters. However, since the problem specifies that only the space character'' is considered whitespace, I should specifically strip spaces using `strip(' ')`.

Wait, actually, `lstrip(' ')` would only remove space characters, not other whitespace like tabs or newlines, but according to the note, only the space character'' should be considered whitespace. So `lstrip(' ')` should suffice.

**Step 2: Check for a sign**

After stripping leading spaces, I need to check if the first character is '+' or '-'. If it is, I'll set a sign variable accordingly and move to the next character. If it's neither, I'll assume the sign is positive.

I need to ensure that if there's a sign, it's immediately after the whitespace. If there's any other character, I should not consider it as a valid start for an integer.

**Step 3: Read digits**

I need to read in the digits following the sign (if any). I'll keep reading characters until I encounter a non-digit character or reach the end of the string.

I can use a loop to iterate through the characters and build the integer string until a non-digit is found.

**Step 4: Convert to integer**

Once I have the string of digits and the sign, I can convert the digit string to an integer and apply the sign.

I need to handle the case where there are no digits after the sign. In that case, I should return 0.

**Step 5: Handle overflow**

After converting to an integer, I need to check if it's within the 32-bit signed integer range. If it's smaller than `-2^31`, set it to `-2^31`. If it's larger than `2^31 - 1`, set it to `2^31 - 1`.

**Step 6: Return the result**

Finally, return the integer value.

Let me consider some examples to test my logic.

**Example 1:**

Input: ""42""

Output: 42

Explanation:

- No leading whitespace.

- No sign.

- Digits ""42"" are read.

- Convert to integer 42.

- Within range, so return 42.

**Example 2:**

Input: ""   -42""

Output: -42

Explanation:

- Leading spaces are ignored.

- '-' sign is read.

- Digits ""42"" are read.

- Convert to integer -42.

- Within range, so return -42.

**Example 3:**

Input: ""4193 with words""

Output: 4193

Explanation:

- No leading whitespace.

- No sign.

- Digits ""4193"" are read.

- Encountered non-digit'', stop reading.

- Convert to integer 4193.

- Within range, so return 4193.

**Additional Test Cases:**

1. Input: ""words and 987""

   Output: 0

   Explanation:

   - Leading non-digit characters, so no integer is read.

2. Input: ""-91283472332""

   Output: -2147483648

   Explanation:

   - '-' sign is read.

   - Digits ""91283472332"" are read.

   - Convert to integer -91283472332.

   - Below the lower limit, so clamp to -2147483648.

3. Input: ""3.14159""

   Output: 3

   Explanation:

   - Digits ""3"" are read.

   - '.' is a non-digit, so stop reading.

   - Convert to integer 3.

   - Within range, so return 3.

4. Input: ""+1""

   Output: 1

   Explanation:

   - '+' sign is read.

   - Digits ""1"" are read.

   - Convert to integer +1.

   - Within range, so return 1.

5. Input: ""  +  413""

   Output: 0

   Explanation:

   - Leading spaces are ignored.

   - '+' sign is read.

   - Next character is space, which is not a digit.

   - No digits are read.

   - Return 0.

6. Input: ""2147483648""

   Output: 2147483647

   Explanation:

   - Digits ""2147483648"" are read.

   - Convert to integer 2147483648.

   - Above the upper limit, so clamp to 2147483647.

Now, let's think about the implementation in code.

I'll need to:

- Strip leading spaces.

- Check for an optional sign.

- Read digits until a non-digit is encountered.

- Convert the digit string to an integer.

- Apply the sign.

- Clamp the value if it's outside the 32-bit integer range.

I need to be careful with the index manipulation while iterating through the string.

Let me sketch a rough algorithm:

1. Initialize index `i = 0`.

2. Skip leading spaces:

   - While `s[i] ==''`, increment `i`.

3. Check for sign:

   - If `s[i] == '-'`, set `sign = -1`, increment `i`.

   - Else if `s[i] == '+'`, set `sign = 1`, increment `i`.

   - Else, set `sign = 1`.

4. Read digits:

   - Initialize an empty string `digits`.

   - While `i < len(s)` and `s[i].isdigit()`, append `s[i]` to `digits`, increment `i`.

5. Convert to integer:

   - If `digits` is empty, return 0.

   - Else, convert `digits` to integer, apply sign.

6. Handle overflow:

   - If the result is less than `-2^31`, set to `-2^31`.

   - If the result is greater than `2^31 - 1`, set to `2^31 - 1`.

7. Return the result.

I need to handle cases where the string is empty or consists only of whitespace. In such cases, I should return 0.

Also, need to handle cases where there's a sign but no digits follow.

Let me consider the implementation in code.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to implement a function `myAtoi(string s)` that converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer, similar to the `atoi` function in C/C++. We have to follow specific steps to parse the string and handle various edge cases.

### Approach

1. **Ignore Leading Whitespace:** 
   - Skip any leading space characters.

2. **Check for Sign:**
   - Check if the next character is '-' or '+'. This determines the sign of the final result.

3. **Read Digits:**
   - Read in the digits until a non-digit character or the end of the string is reached.

4. **Convert to Integer:**
   - Convert the read digits into an integer and apply the sign if necessary.

5. **Handle Overflow:**
   - Clamp the integer to the range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1] if it's out of range.

6. **Return the Result:**
   - Return the final integer value.

2. Create a variable named `original` to store the original integer value and `reversed` initialized with 0 to store the reversed integer value.
3. Iterate through the integer while it's greater than zero and, in each iteration, perform the following operations:

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string? John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","Sure, I can help you with that! So, the problem is to determine whether a given integer `x` is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is a palindrome, but 123 is not.

First, let's understand the constraints and examples provided:

- The function should return `true` if `x` is a palindrome and `false` otherwise.

- The input `x` is an integer within the range of -2^31 to 2^31 - 1.

- Negative numbers are not considered palindromes because the negative sign affects the reading direction.

Looking at the examples:

1. For `x = 121`, it reads the same backward and forward, so it's a palindrome.

2. For `x = -121`, it's not a palindrome because the negative sign makes it different when read backward.

3. For `x = 10`, it's not a palindrome because 10 backward is 01, which is not equal to the original number.

Now, considering the follow-up question: Can we solve this without converting the integer to a string?

Yes, we can solve this problem without converting the integer to a string by reversing the integer itself and checking if the reversed integer is equal to the original integer.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Handle negative numbers and edge cases:**

- If `x` is negative, it's not a palindrome.

- If `x` is 0, it's a palindrome.

- If `x` is a positive number less than 10, it's a palindrome.

2. **Reverse the integer:**

- Initialize a variable `reversed_num` to 0.

- Use a loop to reverse the digits of `x` by continuously taking the last digit of `x` and adding it to `reversed_num`.

- In each iteration, multiply `reversed_num` by 10 and add the last digit of `x` to it.

- Divide `x` by 10 to remove the last digit.

- Continue this process until `x` becomes 0.

3. **Compare the reversed integer with the original integer:**

- If the reversed integer is equal to the original integer, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

Additionally, we need to handle the integer overflow case, but in Python, integers can be of arbitrary size, so we don't need to worry about overflow.

Let's write the code based on this approach:","python
def isPalindrome(x):
    if x < 0:
        return False
    original_x = x
    reversed_num = 0
    while x > 0:
        digit = x % 10
        reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + digit
        x = x // 10
    return reversed_num == original_x","**Correctness:** correct

It calculates the area between these two lines and updates the maximum area if the current area is larger than the previously calculated maximum area. If the height at the left pointer is less than the height at the right pointer, it moves the left pointer to the right. Otherwise, it moves the right pointer to the left. The algorithm continues until the pointers meet.

This algorithm ensures that the maximum area is found without having to check all possible pairs of lines because it always chooses the pair of lines with the maximum possible distance and minimum height difference at each step.

The amount of water that can be contained between two lines is determined by the distance between them (width) and the height of the shorter line, since the water level cannot exceed the height of the shorter line.

### Approach

1. **Initial Consideration**:
   - We need to maximize the area formed between two lines.
   - The area is calculated as the minimum height between two lines multiplied by the distance between them.

2. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - Check every possible pair of lines and calculate the area.
   - Keep track of the maximum area found.
   - This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is inefficient for large arrays.

3. **Optimal Approach Using Two Pointers**:
   - Use two pointers, one starting from the beginning (left) and one from the end (right) of the array.
   - Calculate the area formed by the lines at the current pointers.
   - Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line towards the other pointer.
   - Repeat the process until the pointers meet.

**Constraints:**

I've been given the symbols and their values, and some rules about how Roman numerals work, especially regarding subtraction cases like IV for 4 and IX for 9.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. Given a number between 1 and 3999, I have to convert it to its Roman numeral representation. Roman numerals are built by combining letters, each of which stands for a specific value. The general rule is to write the letters from the largest to the smallest, but there are exceptions where subtraction is used to avoid four characters being repeated in succession.

So, the symbols are:
- I: 1
- V: 5
- X: 10
- L: 50
- C: 100
- D: 500
- M: 1000

And the subtraction principles are:
- I before V or X indicates 4 (IV) or 9 (IX)
- X before L or C indicates 40 (XL) or 90 (XC)
- C before D or M indicates 400 (CD) or 900 (CM)

I need to make sure that my code handles these cases correctly.

Let me think about the approach. One way to do this is to iterate from the largest Roman numeral value to the smallest. I'll start with M (1000), and see how many times 1000 fits into the given number. I'll append 'M' that many times to the result string and subtract that portion from the number. Then move to the next lower value, and so on, until I reach 1.

But I need to handle those subtraction cases carefully. For example, if the number is 9, I should output 'IX', not 'VIV' or 'IIII'. So, I need to check for those specific subtraction cases first.

Maybe I can create two lists: one for the values and one for the corresponding symbols. Then, I can loop through these lists, checking how many times each value fits into the remaining part of the number, append the corresponding symbol, and subtract the value accordingly.

Wait, but for the subtraction cases like 900 (CM), 400 (CD), etc., I need to consider them before their individual components. For example, for 900, I should check if the number is >= 900, then append 'CM' and subtract 900, rather than appending 'C' nine times.

So, perhaps I should include these subtraction cases in my lists as well, with their respective values and symbols.

Let me list out all the possible values and their corresponding Roman symbols, including the subtraction cases:

- 1000: M
- 900: CM
- 500: D
- 400: CD
- 100: C
- 90: XC
- 50: L
- 40: XL
- 10: X
- 9: IX
- 5: V
- 4: IV
- 1: I

I'll arrange them in descending order of value, so that I can iterate from the largest to the smallest, building the Roman numeral accordingly.

Now, I'll need to create two lists: one for these values and one for these symbols.

Then, I'll initialize an empty string to build the Roman numeral.

I'll loop through these lists, and for each value, while the given number is greater than or equal to that value, I'll append the corresponding symbol to the result string and subtract that value from the number.

I'll continue this process until the number is reduced to zero.

Let me try to outline this in pseudocode:","values = [1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1]

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

*   `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
*   `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
*   `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""III ""
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** III = 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""LVIII ""

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  ""MCMXCIV ""
**Output:** 1994
**Explanation:** M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 15`
*   `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.
*   It is **guaranteed** that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.","
    ```python
def roman_to_int(s):
    roman_values = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}
    total = 0
    prev_value = 0
    
    for c in s:
        current_value = roman_values[c]
        if current_value > prev_value:
            total += current_value - 2 * prev_value
        else:
            total += current_value
        prev_value = current_value

    return total
```

    
    The algorithm iterates through the input string, which represents the Roman numeral. At each iteration, the character is converted to its corresponding integer value using a hash map. Then, the value is added to the total. However, if the current value is greater than the previous value, it means that we need to subtract the previous value from the current value (while considering that the previous value has already been added once). To do this, we add to the total the current value minus 2 times the previous value. Finally, the previous value is updated, and the loop continues. After the loop finishes, the total gives us the integer value equivalent to the Roman numeral.
    ","Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

**Symbol**       **Value**
I             1
V             5
X             10

C             100
D             500

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","Alright, so I've got this problem here about converting Roman numerals to integers. I've read through the description, and I understand that Roman numerals are typically written from largest to smallest, left to right, but there are cases where subtraction is used, like IV for 4 instead of IIII. The task is to write a Python function that takes a string representing a Roman numeral and returns its integer value.

First, I need to understand the rules of Roman numerals. There are seven symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M, each with their respective values: 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000. The general rule is that when a smaller numeral appears before a larger one, it's subtracted; otherwise, it's added. For example, IV is 4 (5 - 1), and VI is 6 (5 + 1).

I need to handle the subtraction cases properly. According to the problem, there are six instances where subtraction is used:

- I before V or X: 4 or 9

- X before L or C: 40 or 90

- C before D or M: 400 or 900

So, in my code, I need to check if a smaller numeral is followed by a larger one and handle the subtraction accordingly.

One way to approach this is to iterate through the string from left to right, keeping track of the total sum. For each character, I check if it's smaller than the next one. If it is, I subtract its value; otherwise, I add it.

For example, in ""MCMXCIV"":

- M = 1000 (added)

- C = 100

- M = 1000 -> C < M, so 1000 - 100 = 900 (subtract C)

- X = 10

- C = 100 -> X < C, so 100 - 10 = 90 (subtract X)

- I = 1

- V = 5 -> I < V, so 5 - 1 = 4 (subtract I)

- Total: 1000 + 900 + 90 + 4 = 1994

This seems straightforward. I need to map each Roman numeral character to its integer value and then apply the addition or subtraction rule based on its position and the next character.

I should also consider the constraints: the input string length is between 1 and 15 characters, and it's guaranteed to be a valid Roman numeral in the range [1, 3999]. So, I don't need to handle invalid inputs or numerals outside this range.

Let me think about how to implement this in code. I'll need a dictionary to map Roman numerals to their integer values.","python

First, I need to understand what a prefix is. A prefix of a string is the beginning of it, so for example, in ""flower"", ""flo"" is a prefix, but ""ower"" is not. The longest common prefix among a set of strings is the longest string that is a prefix of all of them.

Looking at the examples:

- For [""flower"", ""flow"", ""flight""], the common prefix is ""fl"".

- For [""dog"", ""racecar"", ""car""], there is no common prefix, so the result is an empty string.

Constraints:

- The array can have between 1 and 200 strings.

- Each string can be up to 200 characters long, and they consist only of lowercase English letters.

Given these constraints, efficiency might not be a huge issue since the input size is small. But it's still good to aim for an efficient solution.

One way to approach this is to iterate through the characters of the first string and check if that character appears in the same position in all other strings. I can stop at the first character that doesn't match across all strings.

Let me think about edge cases:

1. If the array contains only one string, the entire string is the common prefix.

2. If any string is empty, the common prefix must be empty.

3. If there are strings of different lengths, the prefix can't be longer than the shortest string.

4. All strings might be identical, in which case the entire string is the prefix.

I should handle these cases correctly.

Let me sketch a plan:

1. Check if the array is empty. If it is, return an empty string. (Though according to constraints, length >= 1, so maybe not necessary.)

2. Find the shortest string in the array, since the prefix can't be longer than the shortest string.

3. Iterate through the characters of the shortest string.

4. For each character at position i, check if that character is the same in all strings at position i.

5. If they match for all strings, continue to the next character.

6. If they don't match for any string, return the prefix up to that point.

7. If all characters of the shortest string match across all strings, return that string.

8. If no characters match, return an empty string.

This seems straightforward. Now, how do I implement this in code?

I'll need to:

- Find the shortest string. I can do this by using the min function with key=len.

- Loop through the indices of the shortest string.

- For each index, collect the character at that index from each string and check if they are all the same.

- Build the prefix character by character until a mismatch is found.

Let me consider how to check if characters at a given index are the same in all strings.

I can use a set to collect the characters at that index across all strings. If the set has only one unique character, they all match.

If the set has more than one character, there's a mismatch.

Also, I need to handle the case where strings are of different lengths, but by using the shortest string's length, I avoid index errors.

Let me think about the time complexity.

- Finding the shortest string: O(n) time, where n is the number of strings.

- Iterating through the characters: for each index up to the length of the shortest string, I'm iterating through all strings to collect the characters.

- So, overall time complexity is O(m * n), where m is the length of the shortest string, and n is the number of strings.

Given the constraints, this should be efficient enough.

Space complexity is O(1), since I'm only storing a few variables and the prefix.

Now, let me think about implementing this step by step.

First, find the shortest string:

shortest = min(strs, key=len)

Then, initialize an empty string for the prefix.

Then, loop through the indices of the shortest string:

for i in range(len(shortest)):

chars = set(str[i] for str in strs)

if len(chars) == 1:

prefix += chars.pop()

else:

break

Return the prefix.

This seems concise and efficient.

Let me test this logic with the first example:

strs = [""flower"", ""flow"", ""flight""]

shortest = ""flow""

Iterate through indices 0 to 3:

Index 0: 'f' in all strings -> prefix = 'f'

Index 1: 'l' in all strings -> prefix = 'fl'

Index 2: 'o' in ""flower"" and ""flow"", 'i' in ""flight"" -> mismatch, break

Return ""fl""

Correct.

Second example:

strs = [""dog"", ""racecar"", ""car""]

shortest = ""car""

Index 0: 'd', 'r', 'c' -> mismatch, break

Return empty string

Correct.

Edge cases:

- strs = [""a""]

shortest = ""a""

Index 0: 'a' -> prefix = 'a'

Return ""a""

Correct.

- strs = ["""", """"]

shortest = """"

No indices to iterate, return empty string

Correct.

- strs = [""abc"", ""ab"", ""abc""]

shortest = ""ab""

Index 0: 'a' in all -> prefix = 'a'

Index 1: 'b' in all -> prefix = 'ab'

Return ""ab""

Correct.

Seems solid.

Alternatively, I could sort the array and only compare the first and last strings, since the common prefix of the entire array must be a prefix of the first and last strings in a sorted array.

Let me think about that.

Sort the array:

strs_sorted = sorted(strs)

Then, compare strs_sorted[0] and strs_sorted[-1].

Find the common prefix between these two.

This would reduce the number of comparisons, since I'm only comparing two strings instead of comparing each index across all strings.

This could be more efficient, especially if the number of strings is large, but given the constraints, it might not be necessary.

However, it's an interesting optimization.

Let me see how it would work.

For example:

strs = [""flower"", ""flow"", ""flight""]

sorted_strs = [""flight"", ""flow"", ""flower""]

First string: ""flight""

Last string: ""flower""

Find the common prefix between ""flight"" and ""flower"", which is ""fl"".

This works because in a sorted array, the first and last strings represent the extremes, and any common prefix between them must be common to all strings in between.

This is a smarter approach.

Let me see how to implement this.

- Sort the array.

- Take the first and last strings.

- Find the common prefix between them.

- Return that prefix.

This is more efficient in terms of the number of comparisons.

Time complexity:

- Sorting the array: O(n log n), where n is the number of strings.

- Finding the common prefix between two strings: O(m), where m is the length of the shortest string.

Overall time complexity: O(n log n + m)

Comparing to the previous approach's O(m * n), this could be faster for larger n, but given n <= 200 and m <= 200, both are acceptable.

However, the sorted approach is cleaner and more efficient in practice.

Let me consider implementing this approach.

Steps:

1. Sort the array.

2. Take the first and last strings.

3. Compare characters at each index until a mismatch is found.

4. Return the substring from the beginning to the point of mismatch.

This is straightforward.

Let me think about potential issues.

- If the array contains only one string, the first and last are the same, which is correct.

- If the array contains empty strings, the common prefix is empty.

- If all strings are identical, the common prefix is the entire string.

- If there are strings of different lengths, the comparison stops at the end of the shortest string.

Seems fine.

Let me test this logic with the examples.

First example:

strs = [""flower"", ""flow"", ""flight""]

sorted_strs = [""flight"", ""flow"", ""flower""]

First: ""flight""

Last: ""flower""

Compare:

f == f -> prefix = 'f'

l == l -> prefix = 'fl'

i == o -> mismatch

Return ""fl""

Correct.

Second example:

strs = [""dog"", ""racecar"", ""car""]

sorted_strs = [""car"", ""dog"", ""racecar""]

First: ""car""

Last: ""racecar""

Compare:

c!= r -> mismatch

Return empty string

Correct.

Another test:

strs = [""abc"", ""ab"", ""abc""]

sorted_strs = [""ab"", ""abc"", ""abc""]

First: ""ab""

Last: ""abc""

Compare:

a == a -> prefix = 'a'

b == b -> prefix = 'ab'

Index 2: first string has no c, so mismatch

Return ""ab""

Correct.

Seems good.

This approach reduces the number of comparisons significantly, making it more efficient.

I think I'll proceed with this approach.

Now, let's write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the longest common prefix among an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, we should return an empty string.

### Approach
1. **Initial Check**: If the array is empty, return an empty string. (Although according to constraints, the array has at least one string.)
2. **Sort the Array**: Sort the array of strings. The common prefix of the entire array must be a prefix of the first and last strings in the sorted array.
3. **Compare Characters**: Compare characters of the first and last strings in the sorted array until a mismatch is found.
4. **Return the Prefix**: Return the substring from the beginning to the point where the mismatch occurred.

The challenge lies in efficiently finding these triplets without including duplicates and ensuring that the solution is optimized for time complexity.

## Approach

1. **Sorting the Array**: 
   - By sorting the array first, we can leverage the sorted order to avoid duplicates and to use the two-pointer technique efficiently.

2. **Using Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - For each number in the array, treat it as the first element of the triplet.
   - Then, use two pointers (left and right) to find pairs in the remaining part of the array that sum up to the negative of the first element.
   - This reduces the problem to a ""Two Sum II"" problem, which can be solved efficiently with two pointers on a sorted array.

3. **Avoiding Duplicates**:
   - Skip over duplicate values for the first element to avoid duplicate triplets.
   - Within the two-pointer approach, skip over duplicate values for the second and third elements to ensure uniqueness.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have an array of integers, and I need to pick three of them whose sum is as close as possible to the target value. There will be exactly one solution.

Let me look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In the first example:

nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], target = 1

The closest sum is 2, which is obtained by (-1) + 2 + 1 = 2.

In the second example:

nums = [0, 0, 0], target = 1

The closest sum is 0, which is obtained by 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

So, I need to find the sum of any three numbers in the array that is closest to the target.

Constraints:

- 3 <= nums.length <= 500

- -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000

- -10^4 <= target <= 10^4

Given these constraints, I need an efficient solution since the array can have up to 500 elements.

I recall that for the three-sum problem, a common approach is to sort the array and then use a two-pointer technique. Maybe I can adapt that approach here.

So, here's a plan:

1. Sort the array.

2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the closest sum found so far. I can start by setting it to the sum of the first three elements.

3. Iterate through the array with a pointer i from 0 to n-3:

a. Set two pointers, left at i+1 and right at n-1.

b. While left < right:

i. Calculate the sum of nums[i], nums[left], and nums[right].

ii. If the sum is equal to the target, return it immediately, as it's the closest possible.

iii. If the sum is closer to the target than the current closest sum, update the closest sum.

iv. If the sum is less than the target, move the left pointer to the right to increase the sum.

v. If the sum is greater than the target, move the right pointer to the left to decrease the sum.

4. After iterating through all possible i, return the closest sum found.

Wait a minute, in the problem statement, it says ""each input would have exactly one solution."" Does that mean there is only one unique closest sum, or that there is exactly one triplet that gives the closest sum?

I think it means that there is exactly one closest sum, but there might be multiple triplets that give the same closest sum.

In any case, I need to find at least one triplet whose sum is closest to the target.

I should also consider edge cases, such as when the array has exactly three elements, or when all elements are the same.

Let me think about the time complexity of this approach.

Sorting the array takes O(n log n).

The iteration is O(n), and within that, the two-pointer approach is O(n), so overall time complexity is O(n^2), which should be acceptable given the constraints (n <= 500).

Space complexity is O(1), since I'm sorting in place and using only a few variables.

Now, let's consider how to measure ""closeness"" to the target.

I can calculate the absolute difference between the sum and the target, and keep track of the sum with the smallest difference.

If two sums have the same difference, I can pick either one.

So, I'll initialize the closest sum with the sum of the first three elements, and the smallest difference with the absolute difference between that sum and the target.

Then, as I iterate through the array, if I find a sum with a smaller difference, I update the closest sum and the smallest difference.

If I find a sum with the same difference, I can keep the existing closest sum.

Also, as mentioned earlier, if I find a sum that is exactly equal to the target, I can return it immediately, since it's impossible to get closer than that.

Now, let's consider some edge cases.

Edge case 1: Array has exactly three elements.

In this case, there's only one possible triplet, so the sum of all three elements is the answer.

Edge case 2: All elements are the same.

For example, nums = [1,1,1], target = 3.

The sum is 3, which is equal to the target, so it's the closest possible.

Edge case 3: The closest sum is less than the target.

For example, nums = [-1, 0, 1, 1, 2], target = 3.

Possible sums: -1+1+2=2, 0+1+2=3, etc.

The closest sum is 3, which is equal to the target.

Edge case 4: The closest sum is greater than the target.

For example, nums = [-1, 0, 1, 1, 2], target = 0.

Possible sums: -1+0+1=0, which is equal to the target.

But if target = -5, the closest sum would be -1+0+1=0, which is closer than -1+0+1=0, but actually, -1+-1+0=-2, which is closer to -5.

Wait, but in this array, the smallest sum is -1 + 0 + 1 = 0, since there are no three numbers that sum to less than -2.

Wait, nums = [-1, 0, 1, 1, 2], target = -5.

Possible sums:

-1 + 0 + 1 = 0, difference = 5

-1 + 0 + 1 = 0, same as above

-1 + 0 + 1 = 0

-1 + 0 + 2 = 1, difference = 6

-1 + 1 + 1 = 1, difference = 6

0 + 1 + 1 = 2, difference = 7

0 + 1 + 2 = 3, difference = 8

So the closest sum is 0, with a difference of 5.

But is there a sum closer to -5? Let's see.

Is there a sum less than 0?

-1 + -1 + 0 = -2, difference = 3

Is that possible? Wait, the array has only one -1, so -1 + 0 + 1 = 0, -1 + 0 + 1 = 0, -1 + 0 + 2 = 1, -1 + 1 + 1 = 1, 0 + 1 + 1 = 2, 0 + 1 + 2 = 3.

Wait, I see, I mistakenly thought there were two -1s. In the array [-1, 0, 1, 1, 2], the smallest sum is -1 + 0 + 1 = 0.

So, in this case, the closest sum to -5 is 0, with a difference of 5.

Edge case 5: Target is larger than any possible sum.

For example, nums = [-1, 0, 1, 1, 2], target = 10.

The largest possible sum is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, difference = 6.

Edge case 6: Target is smaller than any possible sum.

For example, nums = [1, 2, 3], target = -10.

The smallest possible sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, difference = 16.

Edge case 7: Array contains both positive and negative numbers.

For example, nums = [-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2], target = 0.

Possible sums:

-4 + -1 + -1 = -6, difference = 6

-4 + -1 + 0 = -5, difference = 5

-4 + -1 + 1 = -4, difference = 4

-4 + -1 + 2 = -3, difference = 3

-4 + 0 + 1 = -3, difference = 3

-4 + 0 + 2 = -2, difference = 2

-4 + 1 + 2 = -1, difference = 1

-1 + 0 + 1 = 0, difference = 0

-1 + 0 + 2 = 1, difference = 1

-1 + 1 + 2 = 2, difference = 2

0 + 1 + 2 = 3, difference = 3

The closest sum is 0, with a difference of 0.

So, in this case, the answer is 0.

Edge case 8: All elements are negative.

For example, nums = [-3, -2, -1], target = -6.

Possible sums:

-3 + -2 + -1 = -6, difference = 0

So, the answer is -6.

Edge case 9: All elements are positive.

For example, nums = [1, 2, 3], target = 6.

Possible sums:

1 + 2 + 3 = 6, difference = 0

So, the answer is 6.

Edge case 10: Array has duplicates.

For example, nums = [1, 1, 1, 1], target = 3.

Possible sums:

1 + 1 + 1 = 3, difference = 0

So, the answer is 3.

Edge case 11: Target is zero.

For example, nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4], target = 0.

Possible sums:

-1 + 0 + 1 = 0, difference = 0

So, the answer is 0.

Now, I need to make sure that my algorithm handles all these cases correctly.

I should also think about how to handle duplicates to avoid redundant calculations.

In the two-pointer approach, when I have duplicates, I can skip over them to avoid considering the same sum multiple times.

For example, if nums is sorted, and nums[i] is the same as nums[i-1], I can skip i to avoid considering the same sum again.

Similarly, for the left and right pointers, if nums[left] is the same as nums[left-1], I can skip left.

Wait, actually, in this problem, since we're looking for the closest sum, duplicates don't cause any issues in terms of correctness, but they can slow down the algorithm if not handled properly.

However, since the problem states that there is exactly one solution, I might not need to worry about duplicates affecting the correctness.

But to make the algorithm more efficient, I should skip over duplicates.

Now, let's think about implementing this in code.

First, sort the array.

Then, iterate through the array with i from 0 to n-3.

For each i, set left to i+1 and right to n-1.

While left < right:

Calculate sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]

Calculate diff = sum - target

If abs(diff) < min_diff:

Update min_diff and closest_sum

If sum == target:

Return sum immediately

Else if sum < target:

Increment left

Else:

Decrement right

After the loop, return closest_sum

I need to handle the initialization of min_diff properly.

I can initialize min_diff to a large number, like infinity.

And closest_sum to None.

Then, in each iteration, if abs(diff) < min_diff, update min_diff and closest_sum.

Also, if diff == 0, return sum immediately.

Now, let's consider the time complexity.

As mentioned earlier, sorting is O(n log n), and the two-pointer approach is O(n^2), so overall time complexity is O(n^2).

Given that n <= 500, this should be acceptable.

Space complexity is O(1), since we're sorting in place and using only a few variables.

Now, let's think about writing the code.

I need to make sure to handle the edge cases correctly, such as when the array has exactly three elements, or when all elements are the same.

Let me try writing some pseudocode first.

Pseudocode:

def threeSumClosest(nums, target):

nums.sort()

n = len(nums)

min_diff = float('inf')

closest_sum = None

for i in range(n-2):

if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:

continue

left = i + 1

right = n - 1

while left < right:

sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]

diff = sum - target

if abs(diff) < min_diff:

min_diff = abs(diff)

closest_sum = sum

if diff == 0:

return sum

elif diff < 0:

left += 1

else:

right -= 1

return closest_sum

This seems reasonable.

Let me test this pseudocode with the first example.

nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], target = 1

After sorting: [-4, -1, 1, 2]

i=0, nums[i]=-4

left=1, nums[left]=-1

right=3, nums[right]=2

sum = -4 + -1 + 2 = -3, diff = -4, abs(diff)=4

closest_sum = -3, min_diff=4

sum < target, so increment left

left=2, nums[left]=1

right=3, nums[right]=2

sum = -4 + 1 + 2 = -1, diff = -2, abs(diff)=2

closest_sum = -1, min_diff=2

sum < target, increment left

left=3 == right=3, stop

i=1, nums[i]=-1

left=2, nums[left]=1

right=3, nums[right]=2

sum = -1 + 1 + 2 = 2, diff=1, abs(diff)=1

closest_sum=2, min_diff=1

sum > target, decrement right

right=2 == left=2, stop

i=2, nums[i]=1

left=3, nums[left]=2

right=3, nums[right]=2

sum=1+2+2=5, diff=4, abs(diff)=4 > min_diff=1, so skip

return closest_sum=2

Which matches the first example.

Let's try the second example.

nums = [0,0,0], target=1

After sorting: [0,0,0]

i=0, nums[i]=0

left=1, nums[left]=0

right=2, nums[right]=0

sum=0+0+0=0, diff=-1, abs(diff)=1

closest_sum=0, min_diff=1

sum < target, increment left

left=2 == right=2, stop

i=1, nums[i]=0

left=2, nums[left]=0

right=2, nums[right]=0

sum=0+0+0=0, diff=-1, abs(diff)=1 == min_diff=1, but sum is same, so no change

return closest_sum=0

Which matches the second example.

Let's try the edge case where target is less than any possible sum.

nums = [1,2,3], target=-10

After sorting: [1,2,3]

i=0, nums[i]=1

left=1, nums[left]=2

right=2, nums[right]=3

sum=1+2+3=6, diff=16, min_diff=16, closest_sum=6

sum > target, decrement right

right=1 == left=1, stop

i=1, nums[i]=2

left=2, nums[left]=3

right=2, nums[right]=3

sum=2+3+3=8, diff=18 > min_diff=16, skip

return closest_sum=6

Wait, but earlier I thought the closest sum should be 6 with difference 16.

But actually, is there a sum closer to -10?

No, because the smallest sum is 1+2+3=6.

So, closest_sum=6 is correct.

Another edge case: target is larger than any possible sum.

nums = [-1,0,1,1,2], target=10

After sorting: [-1,0,1,1,2]

i=0, nums[i]=-1

left=1, nums[left]=0

right=4, nums[right]=2

sum=-1+0+2=1, diff=-9, abs_diff=9, closest_sum=1, min_diff=9

sum < target, increment left

left=2, nums[left]=1

right=4, nums[right]=2

sum=-1+1+2=2, diff=-8, abs_diff=8 > min_diff=9, no change

sum < target, increment left

left=3, nums[left]=1

right=4, nums[right]=2

sum=-1+1+2=2, diff=-8, abs_diff=8 > min_diff=9, no change

sum < target, increment left

left=4 == right=4, stop

i=1, nums[i]=0

left=2, nums[left]=1

right=4, nums[right]=2

sum=0+1+2=3, diff=-7, abs_diff=7 < min_diff=9, so closest_sum=3, min_diff=7

sum < target, increment left

left=3, nums[left]=1

right=4, nums[right]=2

sum=0+1+2=3, diff=-7, abs_diff=7 == min_diff=7, no change

sum < target, increment left

left=4 == right=4, stop

i=2, nums[i]=1

left=3, nums[left]=1

right=4, nums[right]=2

sum=1+1+2=4, diff=-6, abs_diff=6 < min_diff=7, so closest_sum=4, min_diff=6

sum < target, increment left

left=4 == right=4, stop

i=3, nums[i]=1

left=4, nums[left]=2

right=4, nums[right]=2

sum=1+2+2=5, diff=-5, abs_diff=5 < min_diff=6, so closest_sum=5, min_diff=5

sum < target, increment left

left=4 == right=4, stop

return closest_sum=5

Which seems correct, as 5 is closer to 10 than 6 away.

Another edge case: All elements are the same.

nums = [1,1,1,1], target=3

After sorting: [1,1,1,1]

i=0, nums[i]=1

left=1, nums[left]=1

right=3, nums[right]=1

sum=1+1+1=3, diff=0, so return 3 immediately

Which is correct.

Edge case: Array with exactly three elements.

nums = [1,2,3], target=6

After sorting: [1,2,3]

i=0, nums[i]=1

left=1, nums[left]=2

right=2, nums[right]=3

sum=1+2+3=6, diff=0, return 6 immediately

Correct.

Edge case: Target is equal to one of the sums.

nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4], target=0

After sorting: [-4,-1,-1,0,1,2]

i=0, nums[i]=-4

left=1, nums[left]=-1

right=5, nums[right]=2

sum=-4+-1+2=-3, diff=-3, abs_diff=3, closest_sum=-3, min_diff=3

sum < target, increment left

left=2, nums[left]=-1

right=5, nums[right]=2

sum=-4+-1+2=-3, diff=-3, abs_diff=3 == min_diff=3, no change

sum < target, increment left

left=3, nums[left]=0

right=5, nums[right]=2

sum=-4+0+2=-2, diff=-2, abs_diff=2 < min_diff=3, so closest_sum=-2, min_diff=2

sum < target, increment left

left=4, nums[left]=1

right=5, nums[right]=2

sum=-4+1+2=-1, diff=-1, abs_diff=1 < min_diff=2, so closest_sum=-1, min_diff=1

sum < target, increment left

left=5 == right=5, stop

i=1, nums[i]=-1

left=2, nums[left]=-1

right=5, nums[right]=2

sum=-1+-1+2=0, diff=0, return 0 immediately

Which is correct.

Edge case: All elements are negative.

nums = [-3,-2,-1], target=-6

After sorting: [-3,-2,-1]

i=0, nums[i]=-3

left=1, nums[left]=-2

right=2, nums[right]=-1

sum=-3+-2+-1=-6, diff=0, return -6 immediately

Correct.

Edge case: All elements are positive.

nums = [1,2,3], target=6

After sorting: [1,2,3]

i=0, nums[i]=1

left=1, nums[left]=2

right=2, nums[right]=3

sum=1+2+3=6, diff=0, return 6 immediately

Correct.

Edge case: Target is smaller than the smallest possible sum.

nums = [1,2,3], target=-10

After sorting: [1,2,3]

i=0, nums[i]=1

left=1, nums[left]=2

right=2, nums[right]=3

sum=1+2+3=6, diff=16, min_diff=16, closest_sum=6

sum > target, decrement right

right=1 == left=1, stop

i=1, nums[i]=2

left=2, nums[left]=3

right=2, nums[right]=3

sum=2+3+3=8, diff=18 > min_diff=16, skip

return closest_sum=6

Correct.

Edge case: Target is larger than the largest possible sum.

nums = [-3,-2,-1], target=10

After sorting: [-3,-2,-1]

i=0, nums[i]=-3

left=1, nums[left]=-2

right=2, nums[right]=-1

sum=-3+-2+-1=-6, diff=-16, abs_diff=16, closest_sum=-6, min_diff=16

sum < target, increment left

left=2, nums[left]=-1

right=2, nums[right]=-1

sum=-3+-1+-1=-5, diff=-15, abs_diff=15 > min_diff=16, no change

return closest_sum=-6

Correct.

Edge case: Duplicate elements.

nums = [-1,0,1,1,2], target=0

After sorting: [-1,0,1,1,2]

i=0, nums[i]=-1

left=1, nums[left]=0

right=4, nums[right]=2

sum=-1+0+2=1, diff=1, abs_diff=1, closest_sum=1, min_diff=1

sum > target, decrement right

right=3, nums[right]=1

sum=-1+0+1=0, diff=0, return 0 immediately

Correct.

Seems like this approach handles all these cases correctly.

Now, let's think about writing the actual Python code.

I need to make sure to handle the initialization properly and to skip duplicates correctly.

Also, I need to handle the case where the array has exactly three elements.

I should also consider the possibility of integer overflow, but since the constraints specify that the array elements and target are within certain bounds, it's unlikely to be an issue in Python.

Now, let's proceed to write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find three integers in an array such that their sum is closest to a given target. We will use a two-pointer technique on a sorted array to efficiently find the closest sum.

### Approach

1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in using the two-pointer technique and making the approach efficient.
2. **Initialize Closest Sum**: Start with the sum of the first three elements and track the smallest difference between this sum and the target.
3. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - For each element, set two pointers: one just after the current element and one at the end of the array.
   - Move the pointers towards each other:
     - Calculate the sum of the current triplet.
     - If the sum equals the target, return it immediately as it's the closest possible.
     - Update the closest sum if the current sum is closer to the target.
     - Adjust the pointers based on whether the sum is less than or greater than the target.
4. **Return the Closest Sum**: After iterating through all possible triplets, return the sum that is closest to the target.

The string can have parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets. I need to make sure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket of the same type and that they are properly nested.

First, I need to understand what makes a string of these brackets valid. From the description:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.

So, for example, an opening parenthesis '(' must be closed by a closing parenthesis ')', not by a closing curly brace '}' or a closing square bracket ']'.

2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

This means that the brackets must be properly nested. For instance, ""{[]}"" is valid because the square brackets are inside the curly braces, and the parentheses are not present but if they were, they would need to be nested correctly as well.

3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

So, there should be no closing brackets without a matching opening bracket ahead of them in the string.

Given these rules, I need to develop an algorithm to check if a given string meets these criteria.

I recall that stack data structures are often used for problems involving matching pairs of symbols, especially when order matters. The stack can help me keep track of the opening brackets I've encountered and ensure that they are closed in the correct order.

Here's a basic plan:

- Initialize an empty stack.

- Iterate through each character in the string.

- If the character is an opening bracket ('(', '{', '['), push it onto the stack.

- If the character is a closing bracket (')', '}', ']'), check if the stack is empty. If it is, that means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so the string is invalid.

- If the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket. If it doesn't match, the string is invalid.

- After processing all characters, if the stack is not empty, that means there are opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so the string is invalid.

- If the stack is empty at the end, the string is valid.

I need to define what it means for brackets to match. I can use a dictionary to map opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets.

For example:

{

'(': ')',

'{': '}',

 '[': ']'

}

So, when I pop an opening bracket from the stack, I can look up its corresponding closing bracket and see if it matches the current closing bracket.

Wait, actually, perhaps it's better to map closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets, to make the matching easier.

Alternatively, since I know the possible pairs, I can directly check if the popped element is the opening bracket that corresponds to the current closing bracket.

Let me think about the implementation.

I'll use a list as a stack in Python, using append to push and pop to pop elements.

I'll iterate through each character in the string:

- If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.

- If it's a closing bracket:

- If the stack is empty, return False.

- Pop the top element from the stack.

- Check if it matches the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket.

- If it doesn't match, return False.

- After processing all characters, if the stack is not empty, return False, else return True.

I need to define what'matches' means. I can have a mapping like this:

{

')': '(',

'}': '{',

']': '['

}

So, when I pop an element from the stack, I can check if it equals the value corresponding to the current closing bracket in this mapping.

This seems efficient and straightforward.

Let me consider some examples to test this logic.

Example 1:

s = ""()""

- Iterate through '(', push onto stack.

- Iterate through ')', check stack is not empty, pop '(' and check if it matches the mapping for ')', which is '('.

- It matches, stack is now empty.

- End of string, stack is empty, return True.

Correct.

Example 2:

s = ""()[{}]""""

- Iterate through '(', push.

- Iterate through ')', pop '(', check matches, yes.

- Iterate through '[', push.

- Iterate through ']', pop '[', check matches, yes.

- Iterate through '{', push.

- Iterate through '}', pop '{', check matches, yes.

- End of string, stack is empty, return True.

Correct.

Example 3:

s = ""({[)]}""

- Iterate through '(', push.

- Iterate through '{', push.

- Iterate through '[', push.

- Iterate through ')', pop '[', check if '['matches ')'? No, ')'maps to '(', which does not match '[ '. So, return False.

Correct, because the sequence is invalid.

Another test case:

s = ""((()))""

- Push '(', '(', '(', pop '(', check matches, yes.

- Pop '(', check matches, yes.

- Pop '(', check matches, yes.

- Stack is empty, return True.

Correct.

Edge cases:

- s = ""(""

- Iterate through '(', push.

- End of string, stack is not empty, return False.

- s = "")""

- Iterate through ')', stack is empty, return False.

- s = """"

- No characters, stack is empty, return True.

- s = ""([]{})""

- Push '(', push '[', push '{', pop '{', matches '}', pop '[', matches ']', pop '(', matches ')'.

- Stack is empty, return True.

Seems solid.

Now, I need to implement this in Python.

I should also consider the constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 10^4

- s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

So, I don't need to handle other characters or empty strings specially beyond the above logic.

I should also ensure that the solution is efficient, but since the algorithm is O(n), it should be fine for the given constraints.

I need to define the mapping from closing to opening brackets.

Let me write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string of parentheses is valid. The string will consist of parentheses only '()[]{}', and we need to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket of the same type and that they are properly nested.

### Approach
1. **Use a Stack**: We utilize a stack to keep track of opening brackets.
2. **Mapping**: Define a mapping from closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets for easy matching.
3. **Iterate through the String**:
   - If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket:
     - If the stack is empty, return `False` (no corresponding opening bracket).
     - Pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket.
     - If it doesn't match, return `False`.
4. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, ensure the stack is empty to confirm all opening brackets have been matched.

1. If either `list1` or `list2` is null, return the other list as the result.
2. Compare the values of the nodes in `list1` and `list2`.
3. If `list1` node value is smaller, set `list1.next` to the result of recursively calling the function with `list1.next` and `list2`.
4. Otherwise, set `list2.next` to the result of recursively calling the function with `list1` and `list2.next`.
5. Return the current node as the new head of the merged list.

This process is repeated until one of the lists becomes null, then the other list is returned as the remainder of the merged list.

Please note that each language has some differences in syntax, like defining a class in Python or using the `nullptr` keyword in C++. However, the core logic of the solution remains the same for all languages.
    ","You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists in a one **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return _the head of the merged linked list_.

**Input:** list1 = \[1,2,4\], list2 = \[1,3,4\]
**Output:** \[1,1,2,3,4,4\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order. Additionally, the sky was clear that day.","To solve this problem, we need to merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list. We'll do this by comparing the values of the nodes from both lists and linking them in order.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We'll create a dummy node to serve as the starting point of the merged list. This helps in easily handling the head of the new list.
   - We'll maintain a current pointer that will move through the new list as we add nodes to it.

2. **Merging Process**:
   - We'll iterate through both lists simultaneously, comparing the values of the current nodes from each list.
   - We'll link the smaller value node to the current pointer and move the pointer of that list to the next node.
   - We'll move the current pointer to the newly added node.
   
3. **Handling Remaining Nodes**:
   - After the loop, if there are remaining nodes in either list, we'll link them directly to the current pointer since both lists are already sorted.

4. **Return the Merged List**:
   - Finally, we'll return the next node of the dummy node, which is the head of the merged list.

    The algorithm uses a helper function called `generateParenthesisHelper` which receives four parameters: the number of open parentheses left to place, the number of close parentheses left to place, the current string that holds the generated parentheses so far, and the result list to store valid combinations.

The algorithm uses a depth-first search to construct valid combinations of parentheses. It starts with `n` open parentheses and increments the number of close parentheses as it places an open parenthesis. When the helper function has no open or close parentheses left to place, it means a valid combination is found, so it adds the combination to the result list.

The helper function recursively calls itself. If there are open parentheses left to place, it calls itself with one less open parenthesis and one more close parenthesis. If there are close parentheses left to place, it calls itself without changing the number of open parentheses and with one less close parenthesis. Finally, the current string in each case is updated with the placed open or close parenthesis.

For example, if `n` is 3, the output should be `[""((()))"",""(()())"",""(())()"",""()(())"",""()()()""]`. And for `n` equals to 1, it's just `[""()""]`.

First, I need to understand what ""well-formed"" means in this context. I think it means that the parentheses are properly nested and matched. So, for `n=3`, ""((()))"" is valid because every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one in the correct order, but something like ""(()"" or ""())("" would not be valid because they don't match properly.

I recall that this is a classic problem often solved using backtracking. Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to a problem by incrementally building candidates and abandoning a candidate as soon as it's determined that the candidate cannot lead to a valid solution.

So, maybe I can build strings by adding either a '(' or a ')' at each step, but I need to make sure that at no point do I have more closing parentheses than opening ones, because that would make the string invalid.

Let me think about the constraints:

1. I can never have more closing parentheses than opening parentheses at any point in the string.

2. The total number of opening parentheses should be equal to the total number of closing parentheses, which is `n` for each.

So, perhaps I can keep track of the number of opening and closing parentheses used so far. I'll start with an empty string and recursively add either an opening or a closing parenthesis, depending on certain conditions.

Here's a rough idea:

- Start with an empty string.

- At each step, I can add an opening parenthesis if the number of opening parentheses used is less than `n`.

- I can add a closing parenthesis only if the number of closing parentheses is less than the number of opening parentheses.

- I continue this process until I've used `n` opening and `n` closing parentheses.

This seems like a plan. Let me try to outline this in code.

I'll need a function, say `generate`, that takes the current string, the count of opening parentheses used, and the count of closing parentheses used.

So, something like:","python

        return
    # If open_count < n, can add an opening parenthesis
    if open_count < n:
        generate(current + '(', open_count + 1, close_count, n)
    # If close_count < open_count, can add a closing parenthesis

3. The function `merge2Lists` is used for merging two sorted linked-lists. The smallest element of the two lists is chosen as the head node and recursively merged with the rest of the lists.

It seems like you're dealing with merging multiple sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list. This is a classic problem that can be approached in several ways. I'll guide you through a efficient solution using a min-heap (priority queue) to manage the smallest elements from each list.

## Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have `k` sorted linked lists.
   - Our task is to merge them into a single sorted linked list.

2. **Insight:**
   - Since each list is already sorted, we can efficiently merge them by always picking the smallest head node among all the lists.

3. **Efficient Method Using Min-Heap:**
   - Use a min-heap to keep track of the smallest elements from each list.
   - Initialize the heap with the first node of each list.
   - Pop the smallest node from the heap and add it to the result list.
   - If the popped node has a next node, push the next node into the heap.
   - Repeat until the heap is empty.

4. **Complexity Analysis:**
   - Time Complexity: \(O(N \log k)\), where \(N\) is the total number of nodes across all lists, and \(k\) is the number of lists.
   - Space Complexity: \(O(k)\), for the heap.

I need to do this without changing the values inside the nodes, meaning I have to manipulate the pointers between the nodes themselves.

First, I need to understand what a linked list is. A linked list is a sequence of nodes, where each node contains some data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The last node points to null, indicating the end of the list.

So, in this problem, I have to swap nodes in pairs. For example, if the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, after swapping, it should be 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3.

I should also consider edge cases, like when the list is empty or when there's only one node. In those cases, the list should remain unchanged.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since I need to swap nodes in pairs, I need to process the list two nodes at a time.

I'll need to keep track of the previous node and the current node. For each pair, I'll swap the current and the next node, and then update the pointers accordingly.

Wait, actually, since I'm swapping adjacent nodes, I need to consider three nodes at a time: the previous node, the current node, and the next node.

Let me try to visualize this with an example.

Take the list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

Initially, prev = null, current = 1, next = 2

After swapping 1 and 2, it should be 2 -> 1, and then 1 should point to the next pair, which is 3 -> 4.

So, after swapping, it's 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3.

I need to make sure that the previous pair's last node points to the next pair's first node after swapping.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can use a dummy node to simplify things.

Let me create a dummy node that points to the head of the list. This way, I don't have to handle the head node separately.

So, dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

Now, I can start from the dummy node and proceed to swap pairs.

First pair: 1 and 2

I need to swap them so that it becomes dummy -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4

Then, move to the next pair: 3 and 4

Swap them: dummy -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3

This seems correct.

Now, how do I implement this in code?

I need to keep track of the previous node, the current node, and the next node.

Wait, actually, in a linked list, each node only has a pointer to the next node, not to the previous one, unless it's a doubly linked list. In this problem, it's a singly linked list.

So, I need to be careful with the pointers.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Create a dummy node and set it to point to the head.

2. Initialize a pointer, let's say 'current', to the dummy node.

3. While current's next and current's next's next are not null (meaning there are at least two nodes left to swap):

a. Define node1 as current's next.

b. Define node2 as current's next's next.

c. Now, swap node1 and node2:

- current.next = node2

- node1.next = node2's next

- node2.next = node1

d. Update current to node1 (which is now the second node in the pair)

4. After the loop, return dummy's next as the new head.

Let me test this logic with the example:

Initial list: dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

First iteration:

current = dummy

node1 = 1

node2 = 2

Swap:

dummy.next = 2

1.next = 2's next = 3

2.next = 1

Now, the list is: dummy -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4

Update current to 1

Second iteration:

current = 1

node1 = 3

node2 = 4

Swap:

1.next = 4

3.next = 4's next = null

4.next = 3

Now, the list is: dummy -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3

Update current to 3

No more nodes to swap, exit the loop.

This matches the expected output.

Let me consider another example: [1,2,3,4,5]

Initial list: dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

First iteration:

current = dummy

node1 = 1

node2 = 2

Swap:

dummy.next = 2

1.next = 3

2.next = 1

List: dummy -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

current = 1

Second iteration:

current = 1

node1 = 3

node2 = 4

Swap:

1.next = 4

3.next = 5

4.next = 3

List: dummy -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5

current = 3

Third iteration:

current = 3

node1 = 5

node2 = null (since there's no next node)

Condition fails, exit loop.

Final list: dummy -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5

Which is correct.

Now, for edge cases:

1. Empty list: []

dummy -> null

No swaps needed, return null.

2. Single node: [1]

dummy -> 1

No next node to swap with, return 1.

I need to make sure my code handles these cases correctly.

Let me try to write some pseudocode:","function swapPairs(head):

`k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[1,2,3,4,5\], k = 2
**Output:** \[2,1,4,3,5\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[1,2,3,4,5\], k = 3
**Output:** \[3,2,1,4,5\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
*   `1 <= k <= n <= 5000`
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

**Follow-up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra memory space? Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","To solve this problem, we need to reverse the nodes of a linked list in groups of size `k`. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k`, the remaining nodes at the end should remain as is.

### Approach

1. **Check if reversal is needed:** If `k` is 1 or the list is empty, return the head as is.
2. **Use a dummy node:** This helps in handling the head pointer easily.
3. **Reverse each group of k nodes:** 
   - Use a pointer to track the current group's previous node.
   - For each group, reverse the nodes using a standard linked list reversal technique.
   - Connect the reversed group to the previous part of the list.
4. **Handle the last group:** If the last group has fewer than `k` nodes, leave it as is.

I need to remove duplicates from a sorted array in place, meaning I shouldn't use extra space for another array. I just need to modify the original array such that all unique elements are placed at the beginning, and then return the count of unique elements.

So, the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, which means that duplicates will be grouped together. My task is to iterate through the array, keep track of unique elements, and rearrange them at the start of the array.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since the array is sorted, I can traverse it and whenever I find a new unique element, I can place it in the next position of the unique elements group.

I need to do this in place, so I should avoid using extra space. That means I cannot create a new array to store unique elements; I have to manipulate the original array.

Let's consider an example to understand this better.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]

Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]

Explanation: The function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. The rest of the array doesn't matter.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]

Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]

Explanation: The function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. The rest of the array doesn't matter.

From these examples, it's clear that I need to maintain the relative order of unique elements as they appear in the original array.

One way to do this is to use two pointers. One pointer will iterate through the array to find unique elements, and another pointer will keep track of the position where the next unique element should be placed.

Let's call them `i` and `j`. `i` will be the iterator, and `j` will mark the position for the next unique element.

Initially, both `i` and `j` can start at 0.

I'll iterate `i` from 0 to len(nums) - 1.

If nums[i] is different from nums[j], it means I've found a new unique element, so I'll place it at j+1 and increment j.

Wait, actually, since j is the position for the next unique element, I should place nums[i] at nums[j+1] if nums[i]!= nums[j].

But let's think carefully.

Suppose nums = [1,1,2]

Initialize j = 0

Iterate i from 0 to 2:

i=0: nums[0]=1, nums[j]=1, same, do nothing

i=1: nums[1]=1, nums[j]=1, same, do nothing

i=2: nums[2]=2, nums[j]=1, different, so place 2 at j+1 which is position 1, and increment j to 1

So now nums = [1,2,2], and j = 1

But actually, we need to return k = 2, which is j + 1

Wait, in this case, j = 1, but k should be 2.

So perhaps k = j + 1

Wait, but in the last step, after placing 2 at position 1, j is incremented to 1, and k = 2.

Seems correct.

Another example: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]

Initialize j = 0

i=0: nums[0]=0, nums[j]=0, same, do nothing

i=1: nums[1]=0, nums[j]=0, same, do nothing

i=2: nums[2]=1, nums[j]=0, different, place 1 at j+1=1, j=1

Now nums = [0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4]

i=3: nums[3]=1, nums[j]=1, same, do nothing

i=4: nums[4]=1, nums[j]=1, same, do nothing

i=5: nums[5]=2, nums[j]=1, different, place 2 at j+1=2, j=2

Now nums = [0,1,2,1,2,2,3,3,4,4]

i=6: nums[6]=2, nums[j]=2, same, do nothing

i=7: nums[7]=3, nums[j]=2, different, place 3 at j+1=3, j=3

Now nums = [0,1,2,3,2,2,3,3,4,4]

i=8: nums[8]=3, nums[j]=3, same, do nothing

i=9: nums[9]=4, nums[j]=3, different, place 4 at j+1=4, j=4

Now nums = [0,1,2,3,4,2,2,3,3,4]

And k = j + 1 = 5

Which matches the expected output.

Seems like this approach works.

So, the algorithm is:

1. Initialize j = 0

2. Iterate i from 0 to len(nums) - 1:

a. If nums[i]!= nums[j], set nums[j+1] = nums[i], and increment j

3. Return k = j + 1

This should work because since the array is sorted, duplicates are adjacent, and this way, we're keeping only the first occurrence of each duplicate group.

Also, we're modifying the array in place, without using extra space.

Now, I need to implement this in Python.

But, I should also consider edge cases.

Edge Case 1: Array with all elements same.

Example: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]

After processing, nums = [1,_ _, _, _, _], k = 1

Edge Case 2: Array with all unique elements.

Example: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]

After processing, nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 5

Edge Case 3: Array with single element.

Example: nums = [1]

After processing, nums = [1], k = 1

Edge Case 4: Empty array.

Wait, according to constraints, nums.length >= 1, so empty array is not possible.

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4

-100 <= nums[i] <= 100

nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

So, no need to handle empty array.

Another thing to consider: The function should modify nums in place, but from the explanation, it's mentioned that for the purposes of this problem, it's fine to ignore the elements beyond the returned length k. So, we don't need to remove them, just overwrite the first k elements.

In Python, arrays are resizable, but since we need to modify in place, we should not create a new array.

But in Python, lists are dynamic, so modifying the list in place would suffice.

Also, the problem mentions that it doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned k, so we can leave elements beyond k unchanged.

Wait, but according to the custom judge, it only checks the first k elements.

So, as long as the first k elements are correct, the rest doesn't matter.

So, in the implementation, after determining k, the first k elements should be unique and in the same order as in the original array.

Implementing the above algorithm in Python should work.

Let me try to write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to remove duplicates from a sorted array in place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. We are required to modify the array in place and return the number of unique elements.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize a pointer `j` to 0. This pointer will keep track of the position of the last unique element found.

2. **Iteration**:
   - We iterate through the array with another pointer `i` starting from the first element to the end.
   - For each element `nums[i]`, if it is different from `nums[j]`, it means we have found a new unique element.
   - We place this new unique element at `nums[j+1]` and increment `j`.

3. **Return the count of unique elements**:
   - The number of unique elements will be `j + 1`.

So, the task is to remove all occurrences of a specific value, `val`, from an integer array `nums`, in-place, and then return the new length of the array after removal. The order of the elements can be changed, and we only need to ensure that the first `k` elements are those not equal to `val`.

Let's break this down. We have an array, and we need to modify it so that all instances of a certain value are removed. Importantly, we have to do this in-place, meaning we shouldn't create a new array; instead, we should manipulate the existing one.

First, I need to think about how to iterate through the array and remove the elements that match `val`. One straightforward way is to use a loop to check each element and move the non-matching elements to the front of the array.

Here's an idea: I can use two pointers. One pointer will iterate through the array, and another will keep track of the position where the next non-`val` element should be placed.

Let's call these pointers `i` and `j`. Pointer `i` will traverse the entire array from start to end. Pointer `j` will only move when we find an element that is not equal to `val`, and we'll use it to place that element at the correct position in the front of the array.

So, initially, both `i` and `j` are set to 0. We start iterating with `i`:

- If `nums[i]` is not equal to `val`, we copy `nums[i]` to `nums[j]` and increment both `i` and `j`.

- If `nums[i]` is equal to `val`, we simply increment `i` and skip that element.

By doing this, all elements not equal to `val` are moved to the front of the array, up to position `j`. The new length of the array without `val` would be `j`.

Let's consider the first example:

nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3

- i=0, nums[0]=3 == val, skip. i=1

- i=1, nums[1]=2!= val, assign nums[j=0]=2, increment i and j to 2

- i=2, nums[2]=2!= val, assign nums[j=1]=2, increment i and j to 3

- i=3, nums[3]=3 == val, skip

- End of array, j=2, which is the new length

So, nums = [2,2,_,_], and k=2

Another example:

nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2

- i=0, nums[0]=0!= val, nums[j=0]=0, i=1, j=1

- i=1, nums[1]=1!= val, nums[j=1]=1, i=2, j=2

- i=2, nums[2]=2 == val, skip

- i=3, nums[3]=2 == val, skip

- i=4, nums[4]=3!= val, nums[j=2]=3, i=5, j=3

- i=5, nums[5]=0!= val, nums[j=3]=0, i=6, j=4

- i=6, nums[6]=4!= val, nums[j=4]=4, i=7, j=5

- i=7, nums[7]=2 == val, skip

- End of array, j=5, which is the new length

So, nums = [0,1,3,0,4,_,_,_], and k=5

This seems to work. Now, let's think about edge cases:

1. If the array is empty, nums = [], val = anything, should return k=0

2. If the array has all elements equal to val, e.g., nums = [1,1,1], val=1, should return k=0

3. If the array has no elements equal to val, e.g., nums = [1,2,3], val=4, should return k=3

4. If the array has only one element equal to val, e.g., nums = [2], val=2, should return k=0

5. If the array has one element not equal to val, e.g., nums = [2], val=3, should return k=1

Let's verify the algorithm with these cases:

1. nums = [], val=3

- No elements, so k=0, which is correct

2. nums = [1,1,1], val=1

- i=0, nums[0]=1 == val, skip

- i=1, nums[1]=1 == val, skip

- i=2, nums[2]=1 == val, skip

- End of array, j=0, which is correct

3. nums = [1,2,3], val=4

- i=0, nums[0]=1!= val, nums[j=0]=1, i=1, j=1

- i=1, nums[1]=2!= val, nums[j=1]=2, i=2, j=2

- i=2, nums[2]=3!= val, nums[j=2]=3, i=3, j=3

- End of array, j=3, which is correct

4. nums = [2], val=2

- i=0, nums[0]=2 == val, skip

- End of array, j=0, which is correct

5. nums = [2], val=3

- i=0, nums[0]=2!= val, nums[j=0]=2, i=1, j=1

- End of array, j=1, which is correct

Looks good. Now, let's think about the implementation in Python.

In Python, arrays are dynamic, but since we need to modify the array in-place, we should avoid using methods that create new arrays, like remove() or list comprehensions that create new lists.

Our two-pointer approach is efficient and meets the in-place requirement, as it only uses a constant amount of extra space for the pointers.

Here's how I would implement it:

def removeElement(nums, val):

j = 0

for i in range(len(nums)):

if nums[i]!= val:

nums[j] = nums[i]

j += 1

return j

This should work as per our earlier examples.

However, the problem mentions that the order of elements can be changed. Our approach maintains the relative order of the elements that are not equal to `val`, which is not required. So, there might be a more efficient way if we don't need to maintain the order.

An alternative approach could be to move all elements equal to `val` to the end of the array. This can be done by swapping elements equal to `val` with elements from the end of the array, and keeping track of the position where elements equal to `val` start.

But since the order doesn't matter, perhaps a two-pointer approach where one pointer starts from the beginning and the other from the end would be efficient.

Let's consider that:

- Initialize two pointers, `left` at 0 and `right` at len(nums)-1

- While left <= right:

- If nums[left] == val, swap nums[left] with nums[right], and decrement right

- Else, increment left

- The elements from left to the end are the ones equal to val, and the new length is left

This approach also works, and might be more efficient in terms of the number of writes, especially if there are many elements equal to val.

Let's see an example:

nums = [3,2,2,3], val=3

- left=0, right=3

- nums[0]=3 == val, swap with nums[3]=3, now nums=[3,2,2,3], left stays 0, right=2

- nums[0]=3 == val, swap with nums[2]=2, now nums=[2,2,3,3], left=0, right=1

- nums[0]=2!= val, left=1

- nums[1]=2!= val, left=2

- left > right, stop

- New length is left=2

This matches the expected output.

Another example:

nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val=2

- left=0, right=7

- nums[0]=0!= val, left=1

- nums[1]=1!= val, left=2

- nums[2]=2 == val, swap with nums[7]=2, now nums=[0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], left=2, right=6

- nums[2]=2 == val, swap with nums[6]=4, now nums=[0,1,4,2,3,0,2,2], left=2, right=5

- nums[2]=4!= val, left=3

- nums[3]=2 == val, swap with nums[5]=0, now nums=[0,1,4,0,3,2,2,2], left=3, right=4

- nums[3]=0!= val, left=4

- nums[4]=3!= val, left=5

- left > right, stop

- New length is left=5

This also matches the expected output.

This approach might be slightly more efficient because it potentially reduces the number of writes when there are many elements equal to val, as it only writes when it finds an element equal to val.

However, in terms of time complexity, both approaches are O(n), as they iterate through the array once.

Space complexity is O(1) for both, as they use a constant amount of extra space.

Given that the order doesn't matter, the two-pointer approach from both ends could be a bit faster in practice, but the difference might not be significant for small arrays.

I think either approach is acceptable, but I'll proceed with the first one I described, as it's straightforward and easy to understand.

Now, to implement this in Python:

def removeElement(nums, val):

j = 0

for i in range(len(nums)):

if nums[i]!= val:

nums[j] = nums[i]

j += 1

return j

This should work correctly for all cases.

Let me test it with the examples:

Example 1:

nums = [3,2,2,3], val=3

- After processing, nums = [2,2,_,_], k=2

Example 2:

nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val=2

- After processing, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_], k=5

Edge cases:

- nums = [], val=1

- k=0

- nums = [1], val=1

- k=0

- nums = [1], val=2

- k=1

All these should work with the above code.

Finally, we need to remember that the function should modify the array in-place, and the part of the array after the new length can be anything, as it's not checked.

So, in Python, since lists are passed by reference, modifying `nums` inside the function will affect the original array.

Therefore, this implementation should satisfy all the requirements.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to remove all occurrences of a specific value from an array in-place and return the new length of the array after removal. We are allowed to change the order of the elements, and we only need to ensure that the first `k` elements are those not equal to the specified value.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We need to modify the array in-place, meaning no additional arrays should be created.
   - We have to ensure that the elements not equal to the specified value are moved to the front of the array.
   - The order of elements can be changed, which provides flexibility in our approach.

2. **Initial Idea**:
   - Use two pointers: one to iterate through the array (`i`), and another to track the position for the next non-val element (`j`).
   - If `nums[i]` is not equal to `val`, place it at `nums[j]` and increment `j`.

3. **Alternative Approach**:
   - Use two pointers starting from the beginning and the end of the array.
   - Swap elements equal to `val` with elements from the end, reducing the array size effectively.

4. **Chosen Approach**:
   - We proceed with the first approach due to its simplicity and ease of understanding.
   - This approach ensures that we iterate through the array once, maintaining a time complexity of O(n).

Otherwise, it uses the built-in `find`, `indexOf` or `index` functions provided by the corresponding language's string data type. These functions return the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring. If the substring is not found, they return specific values like string::npos for C++, -1 for Java, and raise a ValueError exception for Python.

2. Calculate the sign of the result based on the signs of dividend and divisor.
3. We use the bitwise shift operator to handle divisions by powers of 2. In each iteration, we initialize the temp variable as the absolute value of the divisor to calculate how many times it fits into the remaining dividend. We then use another loop to repeatedly double the temp variable (by bitwise left shift) and check if the dividend is still greater or equal. If so, we also double the 'multiple' value associated with temp, as that's the actual quotient in the current iteration.
4. When the shifting loop exits, we subtract the current temp from dividend and accumulate the current multiple to our answer.

   - To optimize, use a window of size equal to the length of the words and slide it across `s` in steps of the word length.

    We can solve this problem by following the steps below:

1. Identify the largest index `k` such that `nums[k] < nums[k + 1]`. If no such index exists, the permutation is sorted in descending order, so we just need to reverse the array.
2. Identify the largest index `l` greater than `k` such that `nums[k] < nums[l]`.
3. Swap the value of `nums[k]` with that of `nums[l]`.
4. Reverse the sub-array `nums[k + 1:]` which is guaranteed to be in non-increasing order.

By making these changes in place and only using constant extra memory, we obtain the next permutation of the array nums.
    ","A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

*   For example, for `arr = [1,2,3]`, the following are all the permutations of `arr`: `[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]`.

The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

*   For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.
*   Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.
*   While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers `nums`, _find the next permutation of_ `nums`.

The replacement must be **[in place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** and use only constant extra memory.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** \[1,3,2\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,1\]
**Output:** \[1,2,3\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,1,5\]
**Output:** \[1,5,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 100` Additionally, the sky was clear that day.","To solve this problem, we need to implement the ""next permutation"" algorithm, which rearranges the digits (or elements in an array) to the next lexicographically greater permutation. If such a permutation does not exist (i.e., the array is in descending order), it should be rearranged to the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

### Approach

1. **Identify the Pivot:** 
   - Starting from the end of the array, find the first element that is smaller than the element immediately after it. This element is called the pivot.
   
2. **Find the Successor:**
   - Once the pivot is found, find the smallest element to the right of the pivot that is larger than the pivot.
   
3. **Swap the Pivot and Successor:**
   - Swap the pivot with its successor.
   
4. **Reverse the_suffix:**
   - Reverse the subarray to the right of the original pivot position to get the next smallest lexicographical permutation.

If the entire array is in descending order, the pivot will not be found, and we simply reverse the entire array to get the smallest permutation.

First, I need to understand what a valid parentheses substring is. A valid parentheses substring is one where every opening bracket '(' has a corresponding closing bracket ')', and they are properly nested.

For example, in the string ""(()"", the longest valid substring is ""()"", which has a length of 2.

In "")()())"", the longest valid substring is ""()()"", which has a length of 4.

And in an empty string or a string with no valid parentheses, the length should be 0.

I need to find an efficient way to solve this problem, preferably with a time complexity better than O(n^2), since the string can be up to 3 * 10^4 characters long.

One common approach to solving parentheses-related problems is using a stack. The stack can help keep track of the indices of opening brackets, and when a closing bracket is encountered, I can match it with the most recent opening bracket.

Here's an idea: I can iterate through the string, and whenever I find a '(', I push its index onto the stack. When I find a ')', I pop the top of the stack (which should be the matching '('), and calculate the length of the valid substring between the current index and the index before the matched '('. This way, I can keep track of the maximum length of valid parentheses.

But I need to handle some edge cases. For example, if there are consecutive closing brackets without matching opening brackets, or if there are unmatched opening brackets.

Let me think about how to handle these cases.

- If the stack is empty when I encounter a ')', it means there's no matching '(', so I can ignore this ')' or consider it as a breaking point for the validity of the substring.

- To handle consecutive unmatched ')'s, I can keep track of indices where the substring is invalid, perhaps by using a set or by resetting a starting point for the current valid substring.

Also, I need to consider the starting point for counting the substring length. Maybe I can keep track of the start index of the current valid substring and update the maximum length as I find valid substrings.

Wait, perhaps I can use a stack to keep track of the indices of unmatched '(', and use these indices to calculate the length of valid substrings.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Initialize a stack and push -1 onto it. This will help in handling the starting index for the first valid substring.

2. Iterate through the string:

a. If the current character is '(', push its index onto the stack.

b. If the current character is ')':

i. Pop the top of the stack.

ii. If the stack is not empty, calculate the length of the valid substring from the current index minus the top of the stack.

iii. If the stack is empty, push the current index onto the stack.

3. Keep track of the maximum length of valid parentheses found during this process.

This seems promising. Let me try to apply this logic to the example inputs.

Take s = ""(()""

Indices: 0: '(', 1: '(', 2: ')'

Initialize stack = [-1]

- i=0, '(': push 0 onto stack => stack = [-1, 0]

- i=1, '(': push 1 onto stack => stack = [-1, 0, 1]

- i=2, ')': pop 1 => stack = [-1, 0]

- Since stack is not empty, length = 2 - (-1) = 3

But the longest valid substring is ""()"", which has length 2, not 3. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust how I calculate the length. Let's think again.

Perhaps I should only calculate the length between the current index and the index after the top of the stack.

Let me try again:

Initialize stack = [-1]

- i=0, '(': push 0 => stack = [-1, 0]

- i=1, '(': push 1 => stack = [-1, 0, 1]

- i=2, ')': pop 1 => stack = [-1, 0]

- Now, since stack is not empty, length = 2 - 0 = 2

Yes, that gives the correct length of 2.

Another example: s = "")()())""

Indices: 0: ')', 1: '(', 2: ')', 3: '(', 4: ')', 5: ')'

Initialize stack = [-1]

- i=0, ')': pop -1 (stack is empty after pop), so push 0 onto stack => stack = [0]

- i=1, '(': push 1 => stack = [0, 1]

- i=2, ')': pop 1 => stack = [0]

- Since stack is not empty, length = 2 - 0 = 2

- Current max = 2

- i=3, '(': push 3 => stack = [0, 3]

- i=4, ')': pop 3 => stack = [0]

- length = 4 - 0 = 4

- Current max = 4

- i=5, ')': pop 0 => stack = []

- Since stack is empty, push 5 onto stack => stack = [5]

So, the maximum length is 4, which is correct.

Another test case: s = """"

There are no characters, so the length should be 0.

Initialize stack = [-1]

- No iterations

- Maximum length is 0

Good.

Another test case: s = ""(()""

As above, maximum length is 2

Seems correct.

Another test case: s = ""())""

Indices: 0: '(', 1: ')', 2: ')'

Initialize stack = [-1]

- i=0, '(': push 0 => stack = [-1, 0]

- i=1, ')': pop 0 => stack = [-1]

- length = 1 - (-1) = 2

- Current max = 2

- i=2, ')': pop -1 => push 2 onto stack => stack = [2]

Maximum length is 2, which is correct.

Seems like this approach works for these cases.

Now, let's think about the time complexity. Since we're iterating through the string once and each stack operation is O(1), the overall time complexity is O(n), which is acceptable for the given constraints.

Space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, when all characters are '(', but since n can be up to 3 * 10^4, it should be fine.

I think this is a solid approach. Now, I'll proceed to implement this in Python.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest valid parentheses substring in a given string consisting only of '(' and ')' characters. 

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a stack to keep track of the indices of unmatched '(' characters.
   - Initialize the stack with `-1` to handle the starting index for the first valid substring.

2. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - If it's '(', push its index onto the stack.
     - If it's ')':
       - Pop the top of the stack (this matches with the current ')').
       - If the stack is not empty, calculate the length of the current valid substring (current index - top of the stack).
       - If the stack is empty, push the current index onto the stack.

3. **Track Maximum Length**:
   - Keep track of the maximum length of valid parentheses found during the iteration.

                current_length = i - stack[-1]
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)

I need to find the index of a given target value in this array, and I have to do it efficiently, specifically in O(log n) time complexity. Since the array is sorted and possibly rotated, a modified binary search seems like the way to go.

First, I need to understand the properties of the rotated sorted array. In a normally sorted array, binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the array is rotated, the usual order is disrupted, but there's still some order present that I can exploit.

Let's consider an example to grasp this better. Take the array [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]. Here, the array has been rotated at pivot index 4. Now, if I were to perform a binary search, I'd typically look at the middle element and decide which half to proceed with based on whether the target is smaller or larger than the middle element. However, in this rotated array, the middle element might be in the ascending part or in the rotated part, which could confuse the standard binary search.

So, I need to modify the binary search to account for the rotation. The key is to identify which part of the array is sorted and then decide whether the target is in that sorted part or in the other part.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.

2. While `left <= right`:

a. Calculate the middle index `mid`.

b. If `nums[mid]` is equal to the target, return `mid`.

c. Determine which part of the array is sorted:

- If `nums[left] <= nums[mid]`, then the left part is sorted.

- Else, the right part is sorted.

d. Based on which part is sorted, decide where the target might be located:

- If the left part is sorted:

- If the target is within the range of the left part (`nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]`), then narrow the search to the left part by setting `right = mid - 1`.

- Else, narrow the search to the right part by setting `left = mid + 1`.

- If the right part is sorted:

- If the target is within the range of the right part (`nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]`), then narrow the search to the right part by setting `left = mid + 1`.

- Else, narrow the search to the left part by setting `right = mid - 1`.

3. If the target is not found after the loop, return -1.

This approach ensures that in each step, we are reducing the search space by half, leading to a time complexity of O(log n), which meets the requirement.

Let's apply this to the example:

nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0

- Initialize left=0, right=6

- mid = 3, nums[mid]=7

- nums[left]=4 <= nums[mid]=7, so left part is sorted

- target=0 is not in the left part (4 <= 0 < 7 is False), so search the right part

- Set left=4

- mid = 5, nums[mid]=1

- nums[left]=0 <= nums[mid]=1, so left part is sorted

- target=0 is in the left part (0 <= 0 < 1), so search the left part

- Set right=4

- mid = 4, nums[mid]=0

- target found, return 4

Another example:

nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target=3

- Initialize left=0, right=6

- mid=3, nums[mid]=7

- nums[left]=4 <= nums[mid]=7, left part sorted

- 3 not in [4,7), search right part

- Set left=4

- mid=5, nums[mid]=1

- nums[left]=0 <= nums[mid]=1, left part sorted

- 3 not in [0,1), search right part

- Set left=6

- mid=6, nums[mid]=2

- nums[left]=2 <= nums[mid]=2, left part sorted

- 3 not in [2,2), search right part (which is empty)

- Set left=7, loop ends

- Target not found, return -1

This seems to work. Now, I need to implement this logic in Python, making sure to handle edge cases, such as single-element arrays, arrays that aren't rotated, arrays where the rotation happens at the first element, etc.

Edge Case 1:

nums = [1], target=0

- left=0, right=0

- mid=0, nums[mid]=1!=0

- nums[left]=1 <= nums[mid]=1, left part sorted

- 0 not in [1,1), search right part

- Set left=1, loop ends

- Target not found, return -1

Edge Case 2:

nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7], target=0 (not rotated)

- left=0, right=6

- mid=3, nums[mid]=4

- nums[left]=0 <= nums[mid]=4, left part sorted

- 0 in [0,4), search left part

- Set right=2

- mid=1, nums[mid]=1

- nums[left]=0 <= nums[mid]=1, left part sorted

- 0 in [0,1), search left part

- Set right=0

- mid=0, nums[mid]=0

- target found, return 0

Edge Case 3:

nums = [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], target=0 (rotated at first element)

- left=0, right=6

- mid=3, nums[mid]=2

- nums[left]=7 <= nums[mid]=2 is False, so right part is sorted

- 0 in (2,6]? No, search left part

- Set left=4

- mid=5, nums[mid]=5

- nums[left]=4 <= nums[mid]=5, left part sorted

- 0 not in [4,5), search right part

- Set left=6

- mid=6, nums[mid]=6

- nums[left]=6 <= nums[mid]=6, left part sorted

- 0 not in [6,6), search right part (empty)

- Set left=7, loop ends

- Target not found, return -1

Wait, in this case, the target is actually present at index 1. So, there must be a mistake in the approach.

Wait, let's re-examine:

nums = [7,0,1,2,4,5,6], target=0

- left=0, right=6

- mid=3, nums[mid]=2

- nums[left]=7 <= nums[mid]=2 is False, so right part is sorted

- Right part is [2,4,5,6], which is sorted.

- target=0 is not in (2,6], so search left part

- Set left=0, right=2

- mid=1, nums[mid]=0

- Found target at index 1

Ah, in the previous thought process, when left=4, right=6, mid=5, nums[mid]=5, and target=0 is not in [4,5), so set left=6. Then at left=6, right=6, mid=6, nums[mid]=6, target not in [6,6), set left=7. Thus, missed the target at index 1.

It seems there's a mistake in the logic. Let's correct it.

Correction:

In the step where left=0, right=6, mid=3, nums[mid]=2, right part [2,4,5,6] is sorted.

Target=0 is not in (2,6], so search left part [7,0,1,2].

Now, left=0, right=2, mid=1, nums[mid]=0.

Found target at index 1.

So, the earlier thought process had an error in tracking the search space.

Therefore, the corrected approach is:

- Always identify which part is sorted.

- Decide whether the target is in the sorted part.

- If yes, search in the sorted part.

- If not, search in the other part.

Implementing this carefully in code should handle all cases correctly.

Now, proceed to implement the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the index of a given target value in a rotated sorted array with distinct values, and we must do this efficiently with a runtime complexity of O(log n). We can achieve this by modifying the binary search algorithm to account for the rotation in the array.

### Approach

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers, `left` and `right`, set to the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
2. **Binary Search Modification**:
   - **Calculate Middle Index**: Find the middle index `mid` between `left` and `right`.
   - **Check for Target**: If `nums[mid]` is equal to the target, return `mid`.
   - **Determine Sorted Half**:
     - If the left half is sorted (`nums[left] <= nums[mid]`):
       - Check if the target lies in the left half. If yes, adjust the `right` pointer.
       - Otherwise, adjust the `left` pointer to search the right half.
     - If the right half is sorted (`nums[mid] < nums[right]`):
       - Check if the target lies in the right half. If yes, adjust the `left` pointer.
       - Otherwise, adjust the `right` pointer to search the left half.
3. **Repeat**: Continue the process until the target is found or the search space is exhausted.
4. **Target Not Found**: If the target is not found after the search, return -1.

This approach ensures that we always know which half of the array is sorted and can make an informed decision about where to adjust our search space, maintaining the logarithmic time complexity.

1. **Binary Search for Left Boundary:**

   - If the middle element is equal to the target, we record its position and continue searching to the left.

   - If the middle element is less than the target, we search in the right half.
   - If the middle element is greater than the target, we search in the left half.

    The given problem requires a binary search algorithm. We define two pointers, `left` and `right`, initially set to the first and last index of the array. We then enter a loop that continues as long as left is less than or equal to right. Inside the loop, we calculate the middle index, `mid`, as the average of left and right. If the value at this middle index is equal to the target value, we return the middle index. If the middle value is less than the target value, we set left to `mid + 1`, meaning we search the right half of the remaining array. If the middle value is greater than the target value, we set the right to `mid - 1`, meaning we search the left half of the remaining array.

I need to check that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes contains the digits 1-9 without any repetition. Only the filled cells need to be checked, and I can ignore the empty cells denoted by '.'.

First, I need to understand what exactly needs to be done. The problem is not about solving the Sudoku or checking if it's fully filled; it's just about validating the current state based on the presence of duplicates in rows, columns, and sub-boxes.

I should start by thinking about how to check each row for duplicate numbers. Since there are 9 rows, I'll need to iterate through each row and check if there are any duplicates among the numbers 1-9. I can ignore the '.' characters as they represent empty cells.

Similarly, I need to check each column for duplicates. This will involve iterating through each column and ensuring that there are no repeating numbers.

The most challenging part seems to be checking the 3x3 sub-boxes. There are nine such sub-boxes in a 9x9 grid, and I need to verify that each of these sub-boxes does not contain duplicate numbers.

Let me think about how to structure this in code. I can represent the Sudoku board as a list of lists in Python, where each inner list represents a row.

First, I'll write a function that takes the board as input and returns True if the board is valid according to the rules, and False otherwise.

I can break down the problem into three main parts:

1. Check all rows for duplicates.

2. Check all columns for duplicates.

3. Check all 3x3 sub-boxes for duplicates.

I need to make sure that none of these checks fail. If any of them find duplicates, the board is invalid.

Let me consider how to implement each of these checks.

**Checking Rows:**

- Iterate through each row in the board.

- For each row, create a set to track the numbers seen.

- Iterate through each cell in the row:

- If the cell is '.', skip it.

- If the cell's value is already in the set, return False.

- Otherwise, add the value to the set.

- If all rows are checked without duplicates, proceed to the next step.

**Checking Columns:**

- Iterate through each column index.

- For each column, create a set to track the numbers seen.

- Iterate through each row in the board:

- If the cell at the current column in the row is '.', skip it.

- If the cell's value is already in the set, return False.

- Otherwise, add the value to the set.

- If all columns are checked without duplicates, proceed to the next step.

**Checking 3x3 Sub-Boxes:**

- I need to iterate through each of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes.

- I can think of the board as a 3x3 grid of sub-boxes.

- For each sub-box, determine the starting row and column indices.

- For example, the first sub-box is rows 0-2 and columns 0-2.

- The second sub-box is rows 0-2 and columns 3-5, and so on.

- For each sub-box, create a set to track the numbers seen.

- Iterate through each cell in the sub-box:

- If the cell is '.', skip it.

- If the cell's value is already in the set, return False.

- Otherwise, add the value to the set.

- If all sub-boxes are checked without duplicates, the board is valid.

I need to make sure that I handle the indices correctly when accessing the cells in the sub-boxes.

Also, since the board is always 9x9, I don't need to worry about variable board sizes.

Let me consider writing helper functions for each of these checks to keep the code organized.

For example, I can have a function `check_rows(board)` that returns True if all rows are valid, and similarly for columns and sub-boxes.

Alternatively, I can integrate all checks in the main function for simplicity.

I should also consider the time complexity. Since I'm iterating through each cell multiple times (once for rows, once for columns, and once for sub-boxes), the overall time complexity will be O(N^2), where N is 9 in this case. This is acceptable since N is small.

Space complexity is also fine as I'm only using sets to track seen numbers in each row, column, and sub-box.

Let me think about potential edge cases:

- A board with all cells empty ('.'). This should be considered valid since there are no filled cells to validate.

- A board with a single filled cell. This should be valid as there are no duplicates.

- A board where only one row, column, or sub-box has duplicates.

- A board that is completely filled and valid.

- A board that is completely filled and invalid due to duplicates in rows, columns, or sub-boxes.

I need to make sure that my function handles these cases correctly.

Also, I need to ensure that the input board is always 9x9 as per the constraints.

I should also handle the input correctly, considering that each cell may have a space after the digit as shown in the examples.

Wait, looking back at the examples, the digits are represented as strings with a space, e.g., ""5 "", ""3 "", etc. So, I need to handle strings of length 2, where the first character is the digit and the second is a space.

Wait, actually, looking at the input format in the examples, it seems like each cell is a string of length 1, representing the digit or '.'. For example, ""5"", ""3"", ""."", etc. So, I need to confirm the input format.

Assuming that each cell is a string of length 1, representing a digit from '1' to '9' or '.' for empty cells.

If that's the case, I can proceed accordingly.

Let me outline the steps in code:

1. Check each row:

a. For each row in the board:

i. Initialize an empty set.

ii. For each cell in the row:

- If cell is '.', continue.

- If cell is already in the set, return False.

- Else, add cell to the set.

2. Check each column:

a. For each column index:

i. Initialize an empty set.

ii. For each row in the board:

- Cell is board[row][column]

- If cell is '.', continue.

- If cell is already in the set, return False.

- Else, add cell to the set.

3. Check each 3x3 sub-box:

a. For each row_start in [0, 3, 6]:

b. For each col_start in [0, 3, 6]:

i. Initialize an empty set.

ii. For each row in row_start to row_start + 3:

- For each col in col_start to col_start + 3:

- Cell is board[row][col]

- If cell is '.', continue.

- If cell is already in the set, return False.

- Else, add cell to the set.

4. If all checks pass, return True.

This seems straightforward. Now, I need to implement this in Python.

I should also consider using built-in functions or data structures to make the code cleaner and more efficient.

Using sets is a good choice for tracking seen numbers due to their average O(1) lookup time.

I should also make sure to handle any non-standard inputs, but based on the problem constraints, the input should be a 9x9 board with cells containing digits '1'-'9' or '.'.

Let me consider writing some test cases based on the examples provided.

**Test Case 1:**

Input:

[

[""5"",""3"",""."",""."",""7"",""."",""."",""."","".""],

[""6"",""."",""."",""1"",""9"",""5"",""."",""."","".""],

[""."",""9"",""8"",""."",""."",""."",""."",""6"","".""],

[""."",""."",""."",""4"",""1"",""9"",""."",""."",""5""],

[""."",""."",""."",""."",""8"",""."",""."",""7"",""9""]

]

Output: true

**Test Case 2:**

Input:

[

[""8"",""3"",""."",""."",""7"",""."",""."",""."","".""],

[""6"",""."",""."",""1"",""9"",""5"",""."",""."","".""],

[""."",""9"",""8"",""."",""."",""."",""."",""6"","".""],

[""."",""6"",""."",""."",""."",""."",""2"",""8"","".""],

[""."",""."",""."",""4"",""1"",""9"",""."",""."",""5""],

[""."",""."",""."",""."",""8"",""."",""."",""7"",""9""]

]

Output: false

Explanation: The same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

I need to make sure that my function correctly identifies the duplicate 8 in the top left sub-box in the second test case.

Let me proceed to implement the function accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given 9x9 Sudoku board is valid based on the filled cells. The validation checks are as follows:
1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

### Approach
1. **Check Rows:** For each row, ensure that it doesn't contain duplicate digits (ignoring '.').
2. **Check Columns:** For each column, ensure that it doesn't contain duplicate digits (ignoring '.').
3. **Check Sub-Boxes:** For each of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes, ensure that it doesn't contain duplicate digits (ignoring '.'.

Sudoku is a puzzle where you have a 9x9 grid, and you need to fill it with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

The problem says that the board is given with some cells already filled, and some empty, represented by '.'. My task is to fill the empty cells following the Sudoku rules.

First, I need to understand the constraints:

1. Each row must contain all digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

2. Each column must contain all digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

3. Each 3x3 subgrid must contain all digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

Given that, I need to fill the board in such a way that all these conditions are satisfied.

I recall that Sudoku can be solved using a backtracking algorithm. The idea is to try to place a number in an empty cell and check if it leads to a valid solution. If it does, great; if not, backtrack and try another number.

So, here's a rough plan:

1. Find an empty cell (represented by '."").

2. Try to place a number from 1 to 9 in that cell.

3. Check if placing that number violates any of the Sudoku rules in the corresponding row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.

4. If it doesn't violate any rules, move to the next empty cell and repeat the process.

5. If it does violate a rule, try the next number.

6. If no number can be placed in the current cell without violating the rules, backtrack to the previous cell and try a different number there.

7. Continue this process until the board is completely filled.

I need to implement this backtracking approach in Python.

First, I need a way to represent the board. According to the problem, the board is a list of lists of strings, where each string is either a digit from '1' to '9' or a '.' for empty cells.

I need functions to:

- Find an empty cell.

- Check if a number can be placed in a particular cell without violating the rules.

- Place a number in a cell.

- Remove a number from a cell (for backtracking).

Also, since the board is 9x9, I can hardcode the size.

Let me think about how to implement the 'check' function. For a given cell (row, col), and a number to place, I need to:

- Check if the number is already present in the same row.

- Check if the number is already present in the same column.

- Check if the number is already present in the same 3x3 subgrid.

If the number is not present in any of these, then it's safe to place the number there.

To check the 3x3 subgrid, I need to determine which subgrid the cell belongs to. Since there are 9 subgrids, I can calculate the subgrid index based on the row and column.

For example, subgrid_index = (row // 3) * 3 + (col // 3)

But actually, I don't need an index; I just need to iterate through the 3x3 subgrid corresponding to the cell.

So, for a given cell (row, col), the subgrid starts at (row - row % 3, col - col % 3)

Then, I can iterate through the 3 rows and 3 columns starting from that point to check for duplicates.

Now, for the backtracking function, I need to:

- Find the next empty cell. If there are no empty cells, the board is solved.

- For each number from 1 to 9, try to place it in the empty cell.

- If it's valid, place the number and recursively call the backtracking function on the next empty cell.

- If the recursion returns True (meaning the board is solved), return True.

- If the recursion returns False, backtrack by removing the number and trying the next number.

- If no number can be placed in the current cell, return False to trigger backtracking in the previous call.

I need to implement this logic carefully to ensure that the board is modified correctly and that the recursion stops when the board is solved.

Also, since the board is modified in-place, I don't need to pass a copy of the board to each recursive call; I can modify the original board directly.

Let me think about how to implement the 'find_empty_cell' function. It should iterate through the board and return the coordinates (row, col) of the first empty cell it finds.

I can iterate through each row and each cell in the row, and when I find a '.', return its coordinates.

If no empty cell is found, return None or some indicator that the board is solved.

Okay, now for the main function, I need to start the backtracking process.

I can have a function like'solve_sudoku(board)', which calls the backtracking function.

The backtracking function can be named 'backtrack(board)'.

I need to make sure that the board is modified in-place, so I don't need to return the board; just return True or False indicating whether a solution was found.

But since the problem says that there is exactly one solution, I can assume that when the board is fully filled, it's the correct solution.

I should also consider that the input board has some pre-filled cells, which I shouldn't modify during the solving process.

So, in the backtracking function, when selecting an empty cell, I should only consider cells that are '.', and skip the pre-filled ones.

Wait, no. The pre-filled cells are already set, and I should not change them. So, when placing numbers, I only place them in the empty cells.

I think my initial plan covers that, as I only try to fill the '.' cells and leave the others as they are.

Let me try to outline the steps again:

1. Define a function to find the next empty cell.

2. Define a function to check if a number can be placed in a specific cell.

3. Define the backtracking function that tries numbers in empty cells and recurses.

4. Call the backtracking function starting from the first empty cell.

Let me think about the 'is_valid' function in more detail.

Given a cell (row, col) and a number, check:

- If the number is not in the same row.

- If the number is not in the same column.

- If the number is not in the same 3x3 subgrid.

To check the row, iterate through all columns in that row and see if the number is already present.

Similarly, check all rows in the same column.

For the subgrid, iterate through the 3x3 cells starting at (start_row, start_col), where start_row = row // 3 * 3 and start_col = col // 3 * 3.

I need to make sure that I'm comparing strings, since the board contains strings.

Now, for the backtracking function, I need to:

- Find the next empty cell using 'find_empty_cell'.

- If no empty cell is found, return True (board is solved).

- Otherwise, for each number from '1' to '9':

- If it's valid to place the number in the empty cell:

- Place the number in the cell.

- Recursively call backtrack.

- If recursion returns True, return True.

- If recursion returns False, reset the cell to '.' and try the next number.

- If no number can be placed, return False.

I need to make sure that the board is modified correctly during this process.

Let me think about how to implement 'find_empty_cell'.

I can iterate through each row and each cell in the row, and return the first cell that is '.'.

I need to return the row and column indices.

If no empty cell is found, return None or maybe return (-1, -1) to indicate that the board is solved.

Similarly, in the backtracking function, if 'find_empty_cell' returns (-1, -1), then the board is solved, and I can return True.

Otherwise, iterate through numbers '1' to '9', try to place them, and recurse.

If recursion returns True, return True.

If not, reset the cell to '.' and continue with the next number.

If all numbers have been tried and none led to a solution, return False to trigger backtracking in the previous call.

I need to make sure that the board is being modified correctly.

Also, since the board is a list of lists of strings, I need to make sure that I'm assigning strings, not integers.

So, when placing a number, do str(num), and when resetting, assign '.'.

Now, let me think about optimizing this.

Since Sudoku boards can be tricky, and backtracking can be slow in the worst case, but given that the board is 9x9, it should be manageable.

But perhaps I can optimize by choosing the empty cell with the fewest possible choices first.

This is known as the ""least constraining value"" heuristic.

However, for a 9x9 Sudoku, the basic backtracking should suffice, and since the problem states that there is exactly one solution, we don't have to worry about multiple solutions or invalid boards.

I should also consider that the board may have some pre-filled cells, and I need to make sure not to overwrite them.

Wait, no, the empty cells are only '.', and the pre-filled cells are digits, which I should leave unchanged.

So, in the 'find_empty_cell' function, I only look for '.', and in the backtracking, I only modify the '.' cells.

Now, let me think about implementing the 'is_valid' function.

Given a row, column, and a number, check if placing that number in that cell violates any Sudoku rules.

To check the row, iterate through all columns in that row and see if the number is already present.

Similarly, check all rows in the same column.

For the 3x3 subgrid, determine the top-left corner of the subgrid, and iterate through its 9 cells to see if the number is already present.

But, I need to make sure that I'm not checking the current cell itself, in case it was previously set and is being reset.

Wait, no. Since I'm placing a new number, I should check if that number already exists in the row, column, or subgrid.

If it does, then it's invalid; otherwise, it's valid.

I need to make sure that I'm checking strings, since the board contains strings.

So, I need to compare the string representation of the number.

Now, let's consider an example.

Suppose the board is:

[

[""5"",""3"",""."",""."",""7"",""."",""."",""."","".""],

[""6"",""."",""."",""1"",""9"",""5"",""."",""."","".""],

[""."",""9"",""8"",""."",""."",""."",""."",""6"","".""],

[""8"",""."",""."",""."",""6"",""."",""."",""."",""3""],

[""4"",""."",""."",""8"",""."",""3"",""."",""."",""1""],

[""7"",""."",""."",""."",""2"",""."",""."",""."",""6""],

[""."",""6"",""."",""."",""."",""."",""2"",""8"","".""],

[""."",""."",""."",""4"",""1"",""9"",""."",""."",""5""],

[""."",""."",""."",""."",""8"",""."",""."",""7"",""9""]

]

And the solution is:

[

[""5"",""3"",""4"",""6"",""7"",""8"",""9"",""1"",""2""],

[""6"",""7"",""2"",""1"",""9"",""5"",""3"",""4"",""8""],

[""1"",""9"",""8"",""3"",""4"",""2"",""5"",""6"",""7""],

[""8"",""5"",""9"",""7"",""6"",""1"",""4"",""2"",""3""],

[""4"",""2"",""6"",""8"",""5"",""3"",""7"",""9"",""1""],

[""7"",""1"",""3"",""9"",""2"",""4"",""8"",""5"",""6""],

[""9"",""6"",""1"",""5"",""3"",""7"",""2"",""8"",""4""],

[""2"",""8"",""7"",""4"",""1"",""9"",""6"",""3"",""5""],

[""3"",""4"",""5"",""2"",""8"",""6"",""1"",""7"",""9""]

]

I need to make sure that my backtracking algorithm can reach this solution from the initial board.

I should also consider writing some unit tests to verify that my solution works correctly.

Given that the problem states that there is exactly one solution, I don't have to handle cases with multiple solutions or invalid boards.

Now, let's think about implementing the 'find_empty_cell' function.

I can iterate through each row and each cell in the row, and return the coordinates (row, col) as soon as I find a '.'.

If no '.' is found after checking all cells, return (-1, -1) to indicate that the board is solved.

Similarly, in the backtracking function, if 'find_empty_cell' returns (-1, -1), return True.

Otherwise, for each number from '1' to '9':

if is_valid(row, col, str(num)):

board[row][col] = str(num)

if backtrack(board):

return True

board[row][col] = '.'

return False

This seems straightforward.

I need to make sure that after placing a number and recursing, if the recursion returns True, I return True immediately, without trying other numbers.

If the recursion returns False, I need to reset the cell to '.' and try the next number.

If all numbers have been tried and none led to a solution, return False to trigger backtracking in the previous call.

I should also consider that the board is modified in-place, so all recursive calls work on the same board.

I need to be careful with the indices, making sure that they are within 0 to 8 inclusive.

Now, let's think about the 'is_valid' function.

Define is_valid(board, row, col, num_str):

# Check row

for i in range(9):

if board[row][i] == num_str:

return False

# Check column

for i in range(9):

if board[i][col] == num_str:

return False

# Check 3x3 subgrid

start_row = (row // 3) * 3

start_col = (col // 3) * 3

for i in range(3):

for j in range(3):

if board[start_row + i][start_col + j] == num_str:

return False

return True

This seems correct.

Now, let's consider implementing the backtracking function.

Define backtrack(board):

row, col = find_empty_cell(board)

if row == -1 and col == -1:

return True

for num in map(str, range(1, 10)):

if is_valid(board, row, col, num):

board[row][col] = num

if backtrack(board):

return True

board[row][col] = '.'

return False

This looks good.

Finally, the main function'solve_sudoku(board)' can just call 'backtrack(board)', and since the board is modified in-place, there's no need to return the board.

But, according to the problem statement, there's no need for a main function; just implement the'solve_sudoku' function.

Wait, actually, in LeetCode problems, often you just implement the function as defined in the problem, without a main function.

So, I can implement'solve_sudoku' which modifies the board in-place.

But for testing purposes, I might want to have a main function that tests the solution with sample input and output.

Now, let's think about potential edge cases.

1. A board that is already solved: All cells are filled correctly. In this case, 'find_empty_cell' should return (-1, -1), and the function should return immediately.

2. A board with only one empty cell: In this case, there's only one cell to fill, and only one possible number that fits.

3. A board that is almost filled, but requires backtracking to find the correct number for the empty cells.

4. A board with multiple empty cells that require deep recursion.

I need to make sure that my implementation can handle these cases correctly.

Also, since the problem states that there is exactly one solution, I don't have to handle cases with multiple solutions or invalid boards.

Now, let's think about the time complexity.

In the worst case, the time complexity is O(9^(n^2)), where n is 3 for a 9x9 board. This is because for each empty cell, we try 9 possible numbers, and there are n^2 cells.

However, in practice, the backtracking-pruning reduces the search space significantly.

Given that the board is 9x9, and modern computers are fast, this should be manageable.

Now, let's think about implementing this in Python.

I need to make sure that the code is efficient and doesn't have any unnecessary computations.

I can also consider optimizing the 'is_valid' function by using sets to keep track of used numbers in rows, columns, and subgrids.

But for a 9x9 board, the simple iteration should be fine.

Alternatively, I can precompute the sets for rows, columns, and subgrids, and update them as I place numbers.

But that might add unnecessary complexity for this problem.

Now, let's think about implementing the 'find_empty_cell' function.

Define find_empty_cell(board):

for row in range(9):

for col in range(9):

if board[row][col] == '.':

return row, col

return -1, -1

This is straightforward.

Now, putting it all together, here's a rough sketch of the code:

def solve_sudoku(board):

def is_valid(board, row, col, num_str):

# Check row

for i in range(9):

if board[row][i] == num_str:

return False

# Check column

for i in range(9):

if board[i][col] == num_str:

return False

# Check 3x3 subgrid

start_row = (row // 3) * 3

start_col = (col // 3) * 3

for i in range(3):

for j in range(3):

if board[start_row + i][start_col + j] == num_str:

return False

return True

def find_empty_cell(board):

for row in range(9):

for col in range(9):

if board[row][col] == '.':

return row, col

return -1, -1

def backtrack(board):

row, col = find_empty_cell(board)

if row == -1 and col == -1:

return True

for num in map(str, range(1, 10)):

if is_valid(board, row, col, num):

board[row][col] = num

if backtrack(board):

return True

board[row][col] = '.'

return False

backtrack(board)

This should work.

Now, let's think about testing this function.

I can use the example provided in the problem statement.

Input:

board = [

[""5"",""3"",""."",""."",""7"",""."",""."",""."","".""],

[""6"",""."",""."",""1"",""9"",""5"",""."",""."","".""],

[""."",""."",""."",""4"",""1"",""9"",""."",""."",""5""],

[""."",""."",""."",""."",""8"",""."",""."",""7"",""9""]

]

Expected output:

[

[""5"",""3"",""4"",""6"",""7"",""8"",""9"",""1"",""2""],

[""6"",""7"",""2"",""1"",""9"",""5"",""3"",""4"",""8""],

[""2"",""8"",""7"",""4"",""1"",""9"",""6"",""3"",""5""],

[""3"",""4"",""5"",""2"",""8"",""6"",""1"",""7"",""9""]

]

I can write a test function to verify this.

def test_solve_sudoku():

board = [

print(""Test passed!"")

test_solve_sudoku()

This should confirm that the solution works correctly.

I can also consider testing with a board that is already solved, to make sure that it doesn't modify the board.

And testing with a board that has only one empty cell, to ensure that it correctly fills in the only possible number.

But for the sake of time, I'll keep it to this one test case.

Now, I need to make sure that the code is clean, readable, and follows Python best practices.

I should also consider adding comments to explain the logic, especially for the backtracking function.

Additionally, I can consider refactoring the 'is_valid' function to avoid redundant computations, but for now, it's fine.

I should also ensure that the function doesn't have any side effects beyond modifying the board, as specified.

I think this should be sufficient for solving the Sudoku puzzle.

## Final Solution
To solve this Sudoku puzzle, we will use a backtracking algorithm. This approach involves placing numbers in empty cells one by one and checking if they lead to a valid solution. If a number leads to a violation of the Sudoku rules, we backtrack and try another number.

### Approach

1. **Find an empty cell**: We need a function to find the next empty cell (represented by '.'). 

2. **Check validity**: For each number from 1 to 9, we check if it is safe to place in the current empty cell without violating the Sudoku rules in the row, column, or the 3x3 subgrid.

3. **Backtracking**: We use recursion to place numbers in empty cells one by one. If a number is valid, we place it and move to the next empty cell. If placing a number leads to a dead end, we backtrack and try the next number.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 30` Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","I've got this problem called ""Count and Say"". It's about generating a sequence of digit strings based on a recursive formula. The sequence starts with ""1"" for n=1, and each subsequent term is generated by ""saying"" the previous term's digit sequence.

So, for example:

- countAndSay(1) = ""1""

- countAndSay(2) = ""11"" (because the first term is one ""1"")

- countAndSay(3) = ""21"" (because the second term is two ""1""s)

- countAndSay(4) = ""1211"" (because the third term is one ""2"" and one ""1"")

- countAndSay(5) = ""111221"" (because the fourth term is one ""1"", one ""2"", and two ""1""s)

And so on.

My task is to write a function that, given a positive integer n, returns the nth term of this sequence.

First, I need to understand the recursive nature of this sequence. Each term is derived from the previous one by describing the count of consecutive digits.

So, to generate the nth term, I need to start from the first term and iteratively build up to the nth term.

Let's think about how to implement this in code.

I can start with n=1, which is ""1"". Then, for each subsequent n, I need to ""say"" the previous term.

To ""say"" the previous term, I need to traverse the string and count the number of consecutive identical digits.

For example, taking n=3, which is ""21"":

- There is one ""2"", followed by one ""1"".

- So, the next term would be ""one 2, one 1"", which is ""1211"".

Similarly, for n=4, ""1211"":

- There is one ""1"", one ""2"", and two ""1""s.

- So, the next term is ""111221"".

I need to implement this process in code.

I'll need a loop that starts from n=1 and goes up to the desired n. In each iteration, I'll generate the next term by ""saying"" the current term.

To ""say"" the term, I'll need to traverse the string and count consecutive identical characters.

I can use a while loop to iterate through the string, counting consecutive digits.

Once I have the count and the digit, I can append the count followed by the digit to form the next term.

I need to handle the base case when n=1, which simply returns ""1"".

Also, I need to ensure that the function can handle n up to 30, as per the constraints.

Let me sketch a rough plan:

1. If n == 1, return ""1""

2. Else, start with the previous term and generate the next one.

To generate the next term:

a. Initialize an empty string for the next term.

b. Initialize a counter to 1.

c. Traverse the current term from left to right.

d. For each character, check if it's the same as the next one.

e. If it is, increment the counter.

f. If it's not, append the counter and the digit to the next term string, then reset the counter to 1.

g. Continue until the end of the string.

3. Repeat this process up to n times.

Wait, actually, I need to think recursively or iteratively.

Since n can be up to 30, and recursion might not be the best approach due to potential stack overflow, I'll opt for an iterative approach.

I'll use a loop that starts from n=1 and builds up to the desired n.

I'll keep track of the current term and update it in each iteration.

Let me try to write some pseudocode.

Initialize term = ""1""

For i from 2 to n:

new_term = """"

Initialize a counter = 1

For j from 1 to length of term:

If term[j] == term[j-1]:

increment counter

Else:

append str(counter) + term[j-1] to new_term

set counter = 1

After the loop, append the last count and digit

term = new_term

Return term

Wait, I need to make sure that I handle the last group of digits.

In the above pseudocode, after the loop, I need to append the last count and digit.

Also, I need to make sure that I don't go out of bounds when accessing term[j].

In programming, string indices start from 0, so I need to adjust the loop accordingly.

Let me refine the pseudocode.

Initialize term = ""1""

For i from 2 to n:

new_term = """"

Initialize counter = 1

For j from 1 to length of term:

if j < length of term:

if term[j] == term[j-1]:

increment counter

else:

append str(counter) + term[j-1] to new_term

set counter = 1

else:

append str(counter) + term[j-1] to new_term

set counter = 1

term = new_term

Return term

This should work.

Let me test this logic with n=2.

Start with term = ""1""

i=2:

new_term = """"

j=1:

j < length (1 <1 is False)

append ""1"" + ""1"" to new_term -> ""11""

term = ""11""

Return ""11""

Correct for n=2.

n=3:

term = ""11""

i=2:

new_term = """"

j=1:

term[1] == ""1"" == term[0] == ""1"" -> increment counter to 2

j=2:

j == length, so append ""2"" + ""1"" -> ""21""

term = ""21""

Return ""21""

Correct for n=3.

n=4:

term = ""21""

i=2:

new_term = """"

j=1:

term[1] == ""1""!= term[0] == ""2"" -> append ""1"" + ""2"" -> ""12"", set counter=1

j=2:

j == length, so append ""1"" + ""1"" -> ""12"" + ""11"" = ""1211""

term = ""1211""

Return ""1211""

Correct for n=4.

Seems good.

Now, implement this in Python.

I need to be careful with string indices.

In Python, strings are zero-indexed.

So, for j from 0 to len(term)-1.

If j < len(term)-1:

if term[j+1] == term[j]:

increment counter

else:

append str(counter) + term[j]

set counter=1

Else:

append str(counter) + term[j]

This might be clearer.

Let me adjust the pseudocode accordingly.

Initialize term = ""1""

For i from 2 to n:

new_term = """"

counter = 1

For j from 0 to len(term)-1:

if j < len(term)-1:

if term[j+1] == term[j]:

increment counter

else:

append str(counter) + term[j] to new_term

set counter=1

else:

append str(counter) + term[j] to new_term

term = new_term

Return term

Yes, this should work.

Let me implement this in code.

Also, I need to handle the case when n=1 immediately.

Now, think about edge cases.

n=1: ""1""

n=2: ""11""

n=3: ""21""

n=4: ""1211""

n=5: ""111221""

n=30: some long string, but should be manageable.

Also, since n can be up to 30, and the strings can get quite long, but Python should handle it fine.

I need to make sure that the function is efficient enough, but since n is small (<=30), efficiency isn't a big concern here.

I should also consider the runtime and space usage, but for n<=30, it's acceptable.

Let me think about the space usage.

At each step, I'm storing the current term and the new term.

The length of the term grows with n, but for n=30, it's manageable.

According to Wikipedia, the length of the nth term is approximately O(n^2), but for n=30, it's still fine.

Now, implement the function.

I need to define a function called countAndSay that takes an integer n and returns a string.

I should also ensure that n is within the constraints, i.e., 1 <= n <= 30.

I can add a check for that, but assuming that n is always valid.

Let me proceed to write the code based on the pseudocode.

Define term = ""1""

If n == 1, return ""1""

Else, loop from 2 to n:

Initialize new_term as empty string

Initialize counter to 1

For j from 0 to len(term)-1:

if j < len(term)-1 and term[j] == term[j+1]:

increment counter

else:

append str(counter) + term[j] to new_term

set counter to 1

Set term = new_term

After the loop, return term

Let me test this logic with n=4.

Start with term = ""1""

n=2:

new_term = """"

j=0:

term[0] == ""1""

term[1]!= ""1"" (j=0 < len-1=0), so append ""11"", set counter=1

term = ""11""

n=3:

new_term = """"

j=0:

term[0] == ""1""

term[1] == ""1"", so increment counter to 2

j=1:

j=1 < len-1=1 is False, append ""21"", set counter=1

term = ""21""

n=4:

new_term = """"

j=0:

term[0] == ""2""

term[1] == ""1""!= ""2"", so append ""12"", set counter=1

j=1:

j=1 < len-1=1 is False, append ""11"", set counter=1

new_term = ""1211""

term = ""1211""

Correct.

Seems good.

Now, think about potential issues.

- n=1 should return ""1""

- n=0 is invalid, but per constraints, n >=1

- n=30, long string, but should be fine

- All terms are strings, no integer overflow issues

- Need to handle the last group of digits properly

- Make sure that the loop doesn't go out of bounds

In the loop, when j reaches len(term)-1, append the count and digit

Also, ensure that the counter is reset appropriately

I think this covers most cases.

Now, proceed to implement the code.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to generate the `nth` term of the count-and-say sequence. The count-and-say sequence is defined by recursively describing the previous term's digit string. Here's how we can approach this:

### Approach

1. **Base Case**: If `n` is 1, the sequence is simply ""1"".
2. **Iterative Building**: For each term from the second up to the `nth`:
   - Start with the previous term's string.
   - Traverse the string, counting consecutive identical digits.
   - For each group of identical digits, append the count followed by the digit to form the next term.
3. **Update Term**: Replace the previous term with the newly formed term for the next iteration.

This approach ensures that we build each term based on the description of the previous term, adhering to the sequence's rules.

    The algorithm is a recursive backtracking algorithm. We define a helper function `findCombinations` that takes the following parameters:

1. `startIndex`: the index of the candidates array from which it can start choosing numbers.
2. `remaining`: the remaining sum needed to reach the target.

The base cases are:
- If `remaining` is 0, it means we have found a valid combination, so we return a list containing an empty list.
- If `startIndex` is equal to the length of candidates, or `remaining` is negative, there are no valid combinations, so we return an empty list.

In the function, we first initialize an empty list called `result`. Then, we make two recursive calls to `findCombinations`:

1. Excluding the current candidate at `startIndex` and incrementing `startIndex`, to search for combinations without this candidate.
2. Including the current candidate in the combination, and decreasing `remaining` accordingly (without updating `startIndex`).

After getting results from both recursive calls, we merge them and return the final list of combinations.

The main function `combinationSum` calls `findCombinations` with `startIndex` as 0 and `remaining` as the target, and returns the result after the recursion is done.
    ","Given an array of **distinct** integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return _a list of all **unique combinations** of_ `candidates` _where the chosen numbers sum to_ `target`_._ You may return the combinations in **any order**.

The **same** number may be chosen from `candidates` an **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** candidates = \[2,3,6,7\], target = 7
**Output:** \[\[2,2,3\],\[7\]\]
**Explanation:**
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** candidates = \[2,3,5\], target = 8
**Output:** \[\[2,2,2,2\],\[2,3,3\],\[3,5\]\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** candidates = \[2\], target = 1
**Output:** \[\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= candidates.length <= 30`
*   `2 <= candidates[i] <= 40`
*   All elements of `candidates` are **distinct**.
*   `1 <= target <= 40` Additionally, the sky was clear that day.","To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach. The idea is to explore all possible combinations of candidates that sum up to the target. Since we can use the same candidate multiple times, we need to allow revisiting the same candidate in our recursive calls.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Backtracking Function**: We'll define a recursive function that takes the current combination, the current sum, and the current index in the candidates array.
2. **Base Cases**:
   - If the current sum equals the target, we add the current combination to the result list.
   - If the current sum exceeds the target, we stop the current recursion path.
3. **Recursive Case**:
   - For each candidate starting from the current index, we add it to the current combination and recurse with the updated sum and index.
   - After the recursive call, we backtrack by removing the last added candidate to explore other combinations.

This approach ensures that we explore all possible combinations without duplicates, given that the candidates array contains distinct integers and we process candidates in a sorted manner.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find all unique combinations of numbers from the given `candidates` array that sum up to the `target`. We can use the candidates as many times as needed.

### Approach
1. **Backtracking**: We will use a backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations.
2. **Recursive Function**: Define a recursive function that considers each candidate and decides whether to include it in the current combination.
3. **Base Cases**:
   - If the current sum equals the target, add the current combination to the result list.
   - If the current sum exceeds the target, terminate the current path.
4. **Recursive Case**:
   - For each candidate starting from the current index, add it to the current combination and recurse with the updated sum and index.
   - Backtrack by removing the last added candidate to explore other combinations.

And there are some constraints— I have to do this in O(n) time and use constant extra space. That sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. I need to find the smallest positive integer that's not present in the array. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 0], the smallest missing positive integer is 3, because 1 and 2 are present, but 3 is not. In the array [3, 4, -1, 1], the smallest missing positive integer is 2, since 1 is present but 2 is not. And in the array [7, 8, 9, 11, 12], the smallest missing positive integer is 1, because 1 is not present in the array.

Okay, so the key here is to find the smallest missing positive integer. That means I can ignore negative numbers and zeros, because I'm only concerned with positive integers starting from 1 upwards.

Now, the constraints specify that I need to solve this in O(n) time and constant extra space. O(n) time means that the algorithm should run in linear time, proportional to the size of the input array. Constant extra space means that I shouldn't be using additional data structures whose space depends on the size of the input array, like creating a new array of size n to mark present numbers.

Alright, so how can I approach this?

One naive approach would be to sort the array first and then iterate through it to find the smallest missing positive integer. But sorting would take O(n log n) time, which doesn't meet the O(n) time requirement.

Another approach could be to iterate through the array and keep track of the positive integers I've seen using a set. Since sets allow constant time lookups, I could then start from 1 and check which is the smallest integer not present in the set. However, this would require O(n) space for the set, which violates the constant space constraint.

Hmm, so I need a way to keep track of which positive integers are present without using extra space proportional to the size of the array.

Wait a minute, the problem allows me to modify the input array since it's given as an unsorted array and there's no requirement to preserve the original contents. Maybe I can use the array itself to mark the presence of numbers.

Let's think about this. If I consider the array indices as related to the positive integers I'm looking for (i.e., index 0 for 1, index 1 for 2, and so on), I could try to place each positive integer in its corresponding position in the array. For example, number 1 should be at index 0, number 2 at index 1, and so on.

By doing this, I can effectively use the array as a kind of hash table where the presence of a number is indicated by its placement in the array.

So, the plan is:

1. Iterate through the array and for each element, if it's a positive integer between 1 and n (where n is the length of the array), swap it with the element at the index corresponding to that number minus one, until it's in its correct position or it can't be swapped anymore.

2. After rearranging the array, iterate through it again and find the first index where the number is not equal to the index plus one. That index plus one would be the smallest missing positive integer.

3. If all numbers from 1 to n are present in their correct positions, then the smallest missing positive integer is n + 1.

Let me try to illustrate this with an example.

Take nums = [3, 4, -1, 1]

Length n = 4

I want to place each number in its correct position:

- 3 should be at index 2 (3-1=2)

- 4 should be at index 3 (4-1=3)

- -1 is not a positive integer, so I can ignore it

- 1 should be at index 0 (1-1=0)

Let's iterate through the array and perform the necessary swaps.

Start with index 0:

nums[0] = 3

3 should be at index 2. nums[2] = -1

Swap nums[0] and nums[2]: array becomes [-1, 4, 3, 1]

Now, nums[0] = -1, which is not a positive integer between 1 and 4, so leave it.

Index 1:

nums[1] = 4

4 should be at index 3. nums[3] = 1

Swap nums[1] and nums[3]: array becomes [-1, 1, 3, 4]

Now, nums[1] = 1

1 should be at index 0. nums[0] = -1

Swap nums[1] and nums[0]: array becomes [1, -1, 3, 4]

Now, nums[1] = -1, which is not a positive integer, so leave it.

Index 2:

nums[2] = 3

3 should be at index 2, so it's already in place.

Index 3:

nums[3] = 4

4 should be at index 3, so it's already in place.

Now, the array is [1, -1, 3, 4]

Next, iterate through the array to find the smallest missing positive integer.

Check index 0: nums[0] = 1, which should be 1. Match.

Check index 1: nums[1] = -1, which should be 2. Not a match. So, 2 is missing.

Therefore, the smallest missing positive integer is 2.

Another example: nums = [1, 2, 0]

Length n = 3

Iterate and place each number:

Index 0: nums[0] = 1, already at index 0.

Index 1: nums[1] = 2, already at index 1.

Index 2: nums[2] = 0, not a positive integer, leave it.

Array remains [1, 2, 0]

Iterate to find the smallest missing positive integer:

Index 0: nums[0] = 1, should be 1. Match.

Index 1: nums[1] = 2, should be 2. Match.

Index 2: nums[2] = 0, should be 3. Not a match. So, 3 is missing.

Therefore, the smallest missing positive integer is 3.

One more example: nums = [7, 8, 9, 11, 12]

Length n = 5

Iterate and place each number:

7 should be at index 6, which is outside the array, so leave it.

8 should be at index 7, outside the array, leave it.

9 should be at index 8, outside the array, leave it.

11 should be at index 10, outside the array, leave it.

12 should be at index 11, outside the array, leave it.

Array remains [7, 8, 9, 11, 12]

Iterate to find the smallest missing positive integer:

Index 0: nums[0] = 7, should be 1. Not a match. So, 1 is missing.

Therefore, the smallest missing positive integer is 1.

Wait a second, in this case, the smallest missing positive integer is 1, which is correct.

But according to my earlier plan, I should iterate through the array and find the first index where nums[index]!= index + 1. In this case, index 0 has nums[0] = 7!= 1, so 1 is missing.

That makes sense.

But what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]? Then, all numbers from 1 to 5 are present, so the smallest missing positive integer should be 6.

In this case, iterating through the array, each nums[index] == index + 1, so after checking all indices, the smallest missing positive integer is n + 1 = 6.

Perfect.

So, to summarize the algorithm:

1. Iterate through the array and place each positive integer in its correct position, if possible.

2. Iterate through the array again and find the first index where nums[index]!= index + 1. The smallest missing positive integer is index + 1.

3. If all positions are correctly filled, the smallest missing positive integer is n + 1.

Now, let's think about the time complexity.

In step 1, for each element, we might perform some swaps. However, each swap puts at least one number in its correct position, so the total number of swaps is at most n. Therefore, step 1 is O(n) time.

Step 2 is simply iterating through the array once, which is O(n) time.

So, overall time complexity is O(n), which meets the requirement.

For space complexity, we only use a constant amount of extra space for variables, so it's O(1), which also meets the requirement.

Are there any edge cases I should consider?

- Array with all negative numbers and zeros, e.g., [-1, 0, -2]. The smallest missing positive integer is 1.

- Array with one element, e.g., [1]. The smallest missing positive integer is 2.

- Array with one element that is not 1, e.g., [2]. The smallest missing positive integer is 1.

- Array with duplicates, e.g., [1, 1]. The smallest missing positive integer is 2.

- Array with numbers larger than n, e.g., [1, 2, 3, 100]. The smallest missing positive integer is 4.

- Array with numbers smaller than 1, e.g., [-1, -2, -3]. The smallest missing positive integer is 1.

- Array with numbers in order, e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The smallest missing positive integer is 6.

- Array with numbers out of order, e.g., [3, 4, -1, 1]. The smallest missing positive integer is 2.

I think I've covered most of the edge cases.

Let me try to implement this logic in code.

First, I'll write a function that takes the array as input and returns the smallest missing positive integer.

I'll need to perform the rearrangement in place.

Here's a rough sketch of the code:

def firstMissingPositive(nums):

n = len(nums)

for i in range(n):

while 1 <= nums[i] <= n and nums[nums[i] - 1]!= nums[i]:

nums[nums[i] - 1], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[nums[i] - 1]

for i in range(n):

if nums[i]!= i + 1:

return i + 1

return n + 1

Let me test this with the earlier examples.

Example 1: nums = [1, 2, 0]

After rearrangement: [1, 2, 0]

Iterate through the array:

Index 0: nums[0] = 1 == 1. Continue.

Index 1: nums[1] = 2 == 2. Continue.

Index 2: nums[2] = 0!= 3. Return 3.

Correct.

Example 2: nums = [3, 4, -1, 1]

After rearrangement: [1, -1, 3, 4]

Iterate through the array:

Index 0: nums[0] = 1 == 1. Continue.

Index 1: nums[1] = -1!= 2. Return 2.

Correct.

Example 3: nums = [7, 8, 9, 11, 12]

After rearrangement: [7, 8, 9, 11, 12]

Iterate through the array:

Index 0: nums[0] = 7!= 1. Return 1.

Correct.

Another test case: nums = [-1, 0, -2]

After rearrangement: [-1, 0, -2]

Iterate through the array:

Index 0: nums[0] = -1!= 1. Return 1.

Correct.

Another test case: nums = [1]

After rearrangement: [1]

Iterate through the array:

Index 0: nums[0] = 1 == 1. Continue.

End of array. Return n + 1 = 2.

Correct.

Another test case: nums = [2]

After rearrangement: [2]

Iterate through the array:

Index 0: nums[0] = 2!= 1. Return 1.

Correct.

Another test case: nums = [1, 1]

After rearrangement: [1, 1]

Iterate through the array:

Index 0: nums[0] = 1 == 1. Continue.

Index 1: nums[1] = 1!= 2. Return 2.

Correct.

Another test case: nums = [3, 4, -1, 1]

Wait, I already did this one. Output is 2, which is correct.

Another test case: nums = [1, 2, 3, 100]

After rearrangement: [1, 2, 3, 100]

Iterate through the array:

Index 0: 1 == 1. Continue.

Index 1: 2 == 2. Continue.

Index 2: 3 == 3. Continue.

Index 3: 100!= 4. Return 4.

Correct.

Another test case: nums = [-1, -2, -3]

After rearrangement: [-1, -2, -3]

Iterate through the array:

Index 0: -1!= 1. Return 1.

Correct.

Another test case: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

After rearrangement: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Iterate through the array:

All numbers are in their correct positions. Return n + 1 = 6.

Correct.

Seems like the algorithm works for these cases.

But I should also consider the constraints mentioned: 1 <= nums.length <= 300, and nums[i] can be as low as -2^31 and as high as 2^31 - 1.

I need to make sure that the algorithm handles large inputs efficiently and doesn't cause issues with large numbers.

In the rearrangement step, I have a while loop that swaps elements until they're in their correct positions. To avoid infinite loops, I need to ensure that the loop terminates. That's why I have the condition `nums[nums[i] - 1]!= nums[i]`, to prevent swapping if the target position already has the correct number.

But wait, what if there are duplicates of the same number? For example, nums = [1, 1].

In this case, after rearrangement, it becomes [1, 1]. The algorithm correctly returns 2.

Another example: nums = [1, 1, 1].

After rearrangement: [1, 1, 1]. Return 2.

Correct.

What if nums = [1, 2, 2]

After rearrangement: [1, 2, 2]. Iterate through:

Index 0: 1 == 1. Continue.

Index 1: 2 == 2. Continue.

Index 2: 2!= 3. Return 3.

Correct.

Seems good.

What if nums = [2, 2, 2]

After rearrangement: [2, 2, 2]

Iterate through:

Index 0: 2!= 1. Return 1.

Correct.

Another consideration: since the array can contain up to 300 elements, and numbers can be very large, I need to make sure that the algorithm doesn't exceed time limits or cause integer overflows, but since we're just swapping and accessing indices, and the number of operations is linear, it should be fine.

I think this should work.

Let me try to implement this in code and test it with the provided examples.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest missing positive integer in an unsorted integer array `nums` with the constraints of running in O(n) time and using constant extra space.

### Approach

1. **Rearrange the array**:
   - We place each positive integer in its correct position if possible. For example, the integer 1 should be at index 0, 2 at index 1, and so on.
   - We swap elements to put them in their correct positions, but only if they are in the range [1, n] and not already in the correct position.

2. **Find the missing integer**:
   - After rearrangement, we iterate through the array to find the first position where the element is not equal to its index plus one. The index plus one is the missing positive integer.
   - If all positions have the correct integers, the smallest missing positive integer is n+1.

    The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach, initializing left and right pointers to the beginning and end of the elevation map, respectively. It also initializes two variables `maxLeft` and `maxRight` to keep track of the maximum heights on the left and right of the pointers, as well as a variable `water` to store the trapped water.

The algorithm iterates through the elevation map until the left pointer is less than the right pointer. In each iteration, it compares the values at both pointers to determine which side is shorter. If the value at the left pointer is less than or equal to the value at the right pointer, it means water can be trapped on the left side up to the height of the shorter bar. The algorithm updates `maxLeft` with the maximum height on the left side and then adds the trapped water (which is the difference between the maximum height and the current height) to the `water` variable. The left pointer is then incremented. If the value at the right pointer is smaller, the same logic is applied to the right side and the right pointer is decremented.

This process is repeated until the left pointer is no longer less than the right pointer, at which point the total trapped water has been calculated and the `water` variable is returned. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) as it only uses constant extra space.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We'll use two pointers, one starting from the left end and the other from the right end of the array.
   - We'll also keep track of the maximum height seen so far from both the left and the right.
   - We'll initialize a variable to keep track of the total trapped water.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - While the left pointer is less than the right pointer:
     - If the height at the left pointer is less than the height at the right pointer:
       - If the current height at the left pointer is greater than the left maximum, update the left maximum.
       - Otherwise, add the difference between the left maximum and the current height to the total trapped water.
       - Move the left pointer to the right.

       - If the current height at the right pointer is greater than the right maximum, update the right maximum.
       - Otherwise, add the difference between the right maximum and the current height to the total trapped water.
       - Move the right pointer to the left.

So, the problem is to match a given string `s` with a pattern `p` that may contain the wildcards `'?'` and `'*'`. The `'?'` matches any single character, and `'*'` matches any sequence of characters, including the empty sequence.

First, I need to think about how to approach this. Since the pattern can have these wildcards, it's not a straightforward string matching problem. I recall that problems involving wildcards can often be solved using dynamic programming (DP).

Let me consider using a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents whether the first `i` characters of `s` match the first `j` characters of `p`.

The base case would be `dp[0][0] = True`, because an empty pattern matches an empty string.

Now, I need to handle the cases for each character in the pattern:

1. If `p[j-1]` is a lowercase letter, then `s[i-1]` must be equal to `p[j-1]` for the strings to match up to this point.

2. If `p[j-1]` is `'?'`, then it can match any single character, so as long as there is a character in `s` to match, the result depends on the previous states.

3. If `p[j-1]` is `'*'`, things get a bit tricky because `'*'` can match zero or more characters.

Let me think about how to handle `'*'`. The `'*'` can match zero or more of any character. So, for `dp[i][j]` when `p[j-1]` is `'*'`, it can either choose to match zero characters from `s`, in which case it would look at `dp[i][j-1]`, or it can match one or more characters, in which case it would look at `dp[i-1][j]`.

So, the recurrence relations would be:

- If `p[j-1]` is a lowercase letter:

  `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] and s[i-1] == p[j-1]`

- If `p[j-1]` is `'?'`:

  `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] and s[i-1] is not empty`

- If `p[j-1]` is `'*'`:

  `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] or dp[i-1][j]`

  Here, `dp[i][j-1]` corresponds to matching zero characters, and `dp[i-1][j]` corresponds to matching one or more characters.

I also need to handle the case when `s` is empty but `p` contains `'*'`. For example, `s = """"` and `p = ""*""` should match, but `s = """"` and `p = ""a*""` should not match because of the 'a'.

Let me initialize the DP table. I'll create a 2D list `dp` of size `(len(s)+1) x (len(p)+1)`, initialized to `False`.

Set `dp[0][0] = True`, since empty pattern matches empty string.

Handle the case when `p` starts with `'*'`. Since `'*'` can match empty sequence, `dp[0][j]` can be `True` if `p[j-1]` is `'*'` and `dp[0][j-1]` is `True`.

Then, iterate through each character in `s` and `p` and fill the DP table according to the rules above.

Finally, `dp[len(s)][len(p)]` will tell whether the entire string `s` matches the pattern `p`.

Let me consider some examples to verify this approach.

**Example 1:**

`s = ""aa"", p = ""a""`

DP table:

- `dp[0][0] = True`

- `dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] and s[0] == p[0] = True and 'a' == 'a' = True`

- `dp[2][1] = dp[1][1] and s[1] == p[0] = True and 'a' == 'a' = True`

Wait, but according to the problem, ""a"" should not match ""aa"" because the pattern is shorter. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust the matching logic.

Wait, actually, the pattern ""a"" should not match ""aa"" because it's shorter. So, in this case, `dp[2][1]` should be False.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that the pattern matches the entire string, not just a prefix.

So, I need to make sure that the matching covers the entire string.

Maybe I need to adjust the DP approach to ensure that the entire string is matched.

Let me think differently. Perhaps I should consider that the pattern must consume all characters in the string.

I recall that in regular expression matching, similar problems are handled by ensuring that the pattern consumes the entire string.

Let me try to adjust the DP approach.

Initialize `dp[0][0] = True`

For `i` from 0 to len(s):

For `j` from 1 to len(p):

If `p[j-1]` is `'*'`:

`dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] or (i > 0 and dp[i-1][j])`

Else:

`dp[i][j] = i > 0 and dp[i-1][j-1] and (s[i-1] == p[j-1] or p[j-1] == '?')`

Finally, `dp[len(s)][len(p)]` should be the answer.

Let me test this with Example 1:

`s = ""aa"", p = ""a""`

DP table:

- `dp[0][0] = True`

- `dp[0][1] = dp[0][0] and ""a"" == '' or '?' -> False`

- `dp[1][0] = False`

- `dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] and ""a"" == ""a"" -> True and ""a"" == ""a"" -> True`

- `dp[2][0] = False`

- `dp[2][1] = dp[1][0] and ""a"" == ""a"" -> False and ""a"" == ""a"" -> False`

So, `dp[2][1] = False`, which matches the expected output.

**Example 2:**

`s = ""aa"", p = ""*""`

DP table:

- `dp[0][0] = True`

- `dp[0][1] = dp[0][0] or dp[0][0] = True or False = True`

- `dp[1][0] = False`

- `dp[1][1] = dp[1][0] or dp[0][1] = False or True = True`

- `dp[2][0] = False`

- `dp[2][1] = dp[2][0] or dp[1][1] = False or True = True`

So, `dp[2][1] = True`, which matches the expected output.

**Example 3:**

`s = ""cb"", p = ""?a""`

DP table:

- `dp[0][0] = True`

- `dp[0][1] = dp[0][0] and '?' == '' -> False`

- `dp[0][2] = dp[0][1] or dp[0][0] and '*' == '' -> False or True and '*' == '' -> False`

- `dp[1][0] = False`

- `dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] and '?' == 'c' -> True and True -> True`

- `dp[1][2] = dp[1][1] or dp[0][2] -> True or False -> True`

- `dp[2][0] = False`

- `dp[2][1] = dp[1][0] and '?' == 'b' -> False and False -> False`

- `dp[2][2] = dp[2][1] or dp[1][2] -> False or True -> True`

Wait, but according to the problem, ""?a"" should not match ""cb"" because '?' matches 'c', but 'a' does not match 'b'. So, the expected output is False, but according to this DP table, `dp[2][2] = True`, which is incorrect.

I must have made a mistake in the DP transitions.

Wait, in the transition for non-'*' characters, I have:

`dp[i][j] = i > 0 and dp[i-1][j-1] and (s[i-1] == p[j-1] or p[j-1] == '?')`

In the last step:

`dp[2][2] = dp[1][1] and 'b' == 'a' or 'a' == '?' -> False and False or False -> False`

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I got `dp[2][2] = True`, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Let me recalculate the DP table for Example 3:

Initialize `dp[0][0] = True`

For i in 0 to 2 (len(s) = 2):

For j in 1 to 2 (len(p) = 2):

If p[j-1] is '*', which it's not in this case.

Else:

`dp[i][j] = i > 0 and dp[i-1][j-1] and (s[i-1] == p[j-1] or p[j-1] == '?')`

So:

`dp[0][1] = 0 > 0 and dp[-1][0] and ('' == '?' or '?' == '?') -> invalid, so False

dp[0][2] = 0 > 0 and dp[-1][1] and ('' == 'a' or 'a' == '?') -> invalid, so False

dp[1][1] = 1 > 0 and dp[0][0] and ('c' == '?' or '?' == '?') -> True and True and True -> True

dp[1][2] = 1 > 0 and dp[0][1] and ('c' == 'a' or 'a' == '?') -> True and False and False -> False

dp[2][1] = 2 > 0 and dp[1][0] and ('b' == '?' or '?' == '?') -> True and False and True -> False

dp[2][2] = 2 > 0 and dp[1][1] and ('b' == 'a' or 'a' == '?') -> True and True and False -> False

So, `dp[2][2] = False`, which matches the expected output.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I mistakenly thought `dp[2][2] = True`. Actually, it should be False, as per the correct calculation.

So, the DP approach seems correct.

Let me consider another example.

**Example 4:**

`s = ""adceb"", p = ""*a*b""`

This should return True, because '*' can match multiple characters.

DP table would be larger, but the idea is the same.

I need to implement this DP approach in code.

Edge Cases to consider:

- s = """", p = """" -> True

- s = """", p = ""a"" -> False

- s = """", p = ""*"" -> True

- s = ""a"", p = """" -> False

- s = ""a"", p = ""?"" -> True

- s = ""a"", p = ""*"" -> True

- s = ""ab"", p = ""a?"" -> True

- s = ""ab"", p = ""a*"" -> True

- s = ""ab"", p = ""a*b"" -> True

- s = ""abc"", p = ""a*c"" -> True

- s = ""abc"", p = ""a?c"" -> True

- s = ""abc"", p = ""a?d"" -> False

I should also consider when p has multiple '*' or '?'.

Implementing this in code, I need to be careful with the indices and ensure that I handle the cases when p starts with '*' or '?' correctly.

I should also consider the performance, but since the constraints are s and p up to length 2000, and DP with O(N*M) time, it should be acceptable.

I need to make sure that the DP table is efficiently implemented, perhaps using a list of lists or optimizing space if possible.

But for clarity, I'll use a 2D list.

Let me proceed to write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this wildcard pattern matching problem, we can use dynamic programming (DP). The idea is to create a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents whether the first `i` characters of the string `s` match the first `j` characters of the pattern `p`.

### Approach

1. **Initialization:**
   - `dp[0][0]` is `True` because an empty pattern matches an empty string.
   - Handle the case where the pattern starts with one or more `'*'` which can match an empty sequence.

2. **DP Transition:**
   - If the pattern character is a lowercase letter, it must match the corresponding character in the string.
   - If the pattern character is `'?'`, it matches any single character.
   - If the pattern character is `'*'`, it can match any sequence of characters (including empty sequence). Hence, `dp[i][j]` can be `True` if either `dp[i][j-1]` (matching empty sequence) or `dp[i-1][j]` (matching one or more characters) is `True`.

   - The value at `dp[len(s)][len(p)]` will tell whether the entire string matches the pattern.

So, you have an array of integers, and you need to find the minimum number of jumps to reach the last element, right? Each element in the array tells you the maximum jump length from that position.

Alright, let's think about this step by step. I need to start from the first element, which is at index 0, and reach the last index, which is n-1, where n is the length of the array. At each index i, I can jump up to nums[i] steps forward.

The goal is to minimize the number of jumps. So, I need some strategy to decide how far I should jump each time to reach the end in the least number of jumps.

One approach that comes to mind is a greedy algorithm. In each jump, I choose to go as far as possible. So, from the current position, I look at the possible jumps I can make and choose the one that allows me to reach the farthest in the array.

Let me try to formalize this:

1. Initialize three variables:

*   `jumps` to count the number of jumps, starting at 0.

*   `current_end` to keep track of the farthest point I can reach with the current number of jumps.

*   `farthest` to keep track of the farthest point I can reach in the next jump.

2. Iterate through the array from the start to the second last element:

*   For each index i, calculate the farthest point I can reach from here, which is `i + nums[i]`.

*   If this `farthest` is greater than the current `current_end`, update `current_end` to this `farthest`.

*   If I reach the `current_end`, increment the `jumps` because I need to make another jump, and set `current_end` to the `farthest`.

3. Continue this process until I reach or surpass the last index.

This seems logical. Let me test this logic with the first example:

nums = [2,3,1,1,4]

- Start at index 0, nums[0] = 2. From here, I can jump to index 1 or 2.

- If I jump to index 1, nums[1] = 3, which allows me to jump up to 3 steps from here, reaching index 4.

- If I jump to index 2, nums[2] = 1, which only allows me to jump to index 3.

- So, the optimal choice is to jump to index 1 and then to index 4, which is 2 jumps.

Let's see how my algorithm would handle this:

- Initialize jumps=0, current_end=0, farthest=0

- Iterate from i=0 to i=3:

- i=0:

- farthest = max(0, 0 + 2) = 2

- Since farthest (2) > current_end (0), update current_end to 2

- i=1:

- farthest = max(2, 1 + 3) = 4

- Since farthest (4) > current_end (2), update current_end to 4

- i=2:

- farthest = max(4, 2 + 1) = 4

- No change

- i=3:

- farthest = max(4, 3 + 1) = 4

- No change

- Since current_end is now 4, which is >= n-1=4, I can stop.

- jumps=1 (since we only needed to make one jump to reach from index 0 to index 1, and then from index 1 to index 4, but according to the algorithm, it seems like it's counting only one jump.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the algorithm to correctly count the jumps.

Let me think again:

- Initialize jumps=0, current_end=0, farthest=0

- For each index i from 0 to n-1:

- If i > current_end, increment jumps, and set current_end to farthest.

- Update farthest to max(farthest, i + nums[i])

- Finally, return jumps

Wait, maybe I need to consider that each time I reach current_end, I need to make another jump.

Let me try again with the first example:

nums = [2,3,1,1,4]

- jumps=0, current_end=0, farthest=0

- i=0:

- i (0) <= current_end (0)

- farthest = max(0, 0 + 2) = 2

- i=1:

- i (1) <= current_end (0)? No, since 1 > 0 → increment jumps to 1, set current_end to farthest (2)

- farthest = max(2, 1 + 3) = 4

- i=2:

- i (2) <= current_end (2)

- farthest = max(4, 2 + 1) = 4

- i=3:

- i (3) <= current_end (2)? No, since 3 > 2 → increment jumps to 2, set current_end to farthest (4)

- farthest = max(4, 3 + 1) = 4

- i=4:

- i (4) <= current_end (4)

- Since we've reached the end, we can stop.

- Total jumps: 2

Yes, that matches the expected output.

Let's try the second example:

nums = [2,3,0,1,4]

- jumps=0, current_end=0, farthest=0

- i=0:

- i (0) <= current_end (0)

- farthest = max(0, 0 + 2) = 2

- i=1:

- i (1) <= current_end (0)? No → jumps=1, current_end=2

- farthest = max(2, 1 + 3) = 4

- i=2:

- i (2) <= current_end (2)

- farthest = max(4, 2 + 0) = 4

- i=3:

- i (3) <= current_end (2)? No → jumps=2, current_end=4

- farthest = max(4, 3 + 1) = 4

- i=4:

- i (4) <= current_end (4)

- Stop.

- Total jumps: 2

Again, matches the expected output.

Seems like this algorithm works. Now, let's think about the time complexity. We're iterating through the array once, so O(n), which is efficient given the constraints (n <= 10^4).

Are there any edge cases I should consider?

- If the array has only one element, n=1, I'm already at the end, so jumps=0.

- If the array has two elements, n=2, I can jump directly to the end in one jump, since nums[0] >=1 (as per constraints, it's guaranteed to reach the end).

- If the array is larger, the algorithm should handle it as per the examples.

Let me try another example:

nums = [3,2,1,0,4]

Wait, according to the constraints, it's guaranteed that I can reach the last index, but in this case, starting from index 0 with nums[0]=3, I can jump to index 1,2, or 3.

- If I jump to index 1, nums[1]=2, can jump to index 3.

- From index 3, nums[3]=0, can't jump further.

- But the last index is 4, which is not reachable from index 3.

- Wait, according to the constraints, it's guaranteed that I can reach the last index, so this input is invalid.

Another example:

nums = [5,1,3,1,1,1,1,1]

- jumps=0, current_end=0, farthest=0

- i=0:

- i (0) <= current_end (0)

- farthest = max(0, 0 + 5) = 5

- i=1:

- i (1) <= current_end (0)? No → jumps=1, current_end=5

- farthest = max(5, 1 + 1) = 5

- i=2:

- i (2) <= current_end (5)

- farthest = max(5, 2 + 3) = 5

- i=3:

- i (3) <= current_end (5)

- farthest = max(5, 3 + 1) = 5

- i=4:

- i (4) <= current_end (5)

- farthest = max(5, 4 + 1) = 5

- i=5:

- i (5) <= current_end (5)

- farthest = max(5, 5 + 1) = 6

- i=6:

- i (6) <= current_end (5)? No → jumps=2, current_end=6

- farthest = max(6, 6 + 1) = 7

- i=7:

- i (7) <= current_end (6)? No → jumps=3, current_end=7

- farthest = max(7, 7 + 1) = 8

- Since n=8, we've reached the end.

- Total jumps: 3

This seems correct.

Now, let's think about implementing this in Python.

I need to iterate through the array, keeping track of current_end and farthest. Whenever I reach current_end, I increment jumps and set current_end to farthest.

I need to make sure that I don't go beyond the array length.

Also, if the array has only one element, I should return 0.

Let me sketch the code:

def jump(nums):

n = len(nums)

if n <= 1:

return 0

jumps = 0

current_end = 0

farthest = 0

for i in range(n):

if i > current_end:

jumps += 1

current_end = farthest

if current_end >= n - 1:

break

farthest = max(farthest, i + nums[i])

return jumps

Let me test this with the first example:

nums = [2,3,1,1,4]

n=5

Initialize jumps=0, current_end=0, farthest=0

i=0:

0 <= 0 → farthest = max(0,0+2)=2

i=1:

1 <= 0? No → jumps=1, current_end=2

farthest = max(2,1+3)=4

i=2:

2 <= 2 → farthest = max(4,2+1)=4

i=3:

3 <= 2? No → jumps=2, current_end=4

farthest = max(4,3+1)=4

i=4:

4 <= 4 → do nothing

Return jumps=2

Correct.

Second example:

nums = [2,3,0,1,4]

n=5

jumps=0, current_end=0, farthest=0

i=0:

0 <= 0 → farthest = max(0,0+2)=2

i=1:

1 <= 0? No → jumps=1, current_end=2

farthest = max(2,1+3)=4

i=2:

2 <= 2 → farthest = max(4,2+0)=4

i=3:

3 <= 2? No → jumps=2, current_end=4

farthest = max(4,3+1)=4

i=4:

4 <= 4 → do nothing

Return jumps=2

Correct.

Edge case:

nums = [1,1,1,1,1]

n=5

jumps=0, current_end=0, farthest=0

i=0:

0 <= 0 → farthest = max(0,0+1)=1

i=1:

1 <= 0? No → jumps=1, current_end=1

farthest = max(1,1+1)=2

i=2:

2 <= 1? No → jumps=2, current_end=2

farthest = max(2,2+1)=3

i=3:

3 <= 2? No → jumps=3, current_end=3

farthest = max(3,3+1)=4

i=4:

4 <= 3? No → jumps=4, current_end=4

Return jumps=4

Which is correct, as each step jumps 1 step.

Another edge case:

nums = [4,1,1,1,1]

n=5

jumps=0, current_end=0, farthest=0

i=0:

0 <= 0 → farthest = max(0,0+4)=4

i=1:

1 <= 0? No → jumps=1, current_end=4

farthest = max(4,1+1)=4

i=2:

2 <= 4 → farthest = max(4,2+1)=4

i=3:

3 <= 4 → farthest = max(4,3+1)=4

i=4:

4 <= 4 → do nothing

Return jumps=1

Correct, since from index 0, you can jump directly to index 4.

Seems solid. I think this should work for all cases.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index of an array, where each element in the array represents the maximum jump length from that position.

### Approach
We will use a greedy algorithm to solve this problem. The key idea is to track the farthest location we can reach with the current number of jumps and update the jump count efficiently.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `jumps`: to count the number of jumps needed.
   - `current_end`: to keep track of the farthest index we can reach with the current number of jumps.
   - `farthest`: to keep track of the farthest index we can reach in the next jump.

2. **Iteration**:
   - Loop through the array from the start to the second last index.
   - For each index `i`, calculate the farthest index we can reach from `i`, which is `i + nums[i]`.
   - If `i` equals `current_end`, it means we have exhausted the range of the current jump, so we need to make another jump and update `current_end` to `farthest`.
   - Update `farthest` with the maximum reach from the current index.

3. **Termination**:
   - If `current_end` is beyond or at the last index, stop the iteration.
   - Return the number of jumps.

    The algorithm uses backtracking to generate all possible permutations. It works by swapping the elements in the input array in a recursive manner.

1. The base case is when the index reaches the last element of the array; at this point, we append the current configuration to the ""results"" list.
2. For each index, we iterate from `index` to the end of the array, performing the following steps:
    a. Swap `index` and `i` elements.
    b. Recursively call the helper function with `index + 1`.
    c. Swap the elements back to their original positions.

This will generate all possible permutations, as it swaps elements in different positions while maintaining the original order in the input array.

A permutation is a rearrangement of the elements of the array. For example, for the array [1, 2, 3], the permutations are:

### Approach

We can use a backtracking approach to generate all permutations. Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to a problem by incrementally building candidates and abandoning a candidate as soon as it is determined that the candidate cannot lead to a valid solution.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Base Case:** If the current permutation's length is equal to the length of the input array, we have a complete permutation, so we add it to the result list.

2. **Recursive Case:** For each element in the input array, if it hasn't been used in the current permutation, we add it to the current permutation and recursively generate permutations with the remaining elements.

3. **Backtracking:** After exploring all permutations that include the current element at the current position, we remove it from the current permutation to try the next element.

    We use backtracking to generate permutations. Firstly, we sort the `nums` array to make sure that duplicate numbers are located together. Then, for each recursive backtracking call, we swap the elements in the range `[start, len(nums) - 1]` with `nums[start]`, ignoring already-visited elements by using a `visited` array.

We also skip any element that is equal to the current `start` element to avoid duplicates. After generating a valid permutation by iterating through all indices, we append the current permutation to the result array. When backtracking, we maintain the original order of elements before moving to the next level.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n! * n) since there are n! available permutations and each permutation requires O(n) time to build the solution. The space complexity is O(n) to store the `visited` array and temporary lists.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Anagrams**: Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters in the same frequencies, regardless of the order.
2. **Using a Hash Map**: We can use a hash map to group anagrams. The key idea is to create a unique key for each group of anagrams.
3. **Choosing a Key**: A suitable key can be the sorted version of each string. Since anagrams will have the same sorted string, they can be grouped under the same key.
4. **Iterate and Group**: Iterate through the list of strings, sort each string, and use the sorted string as a key in the hash map. Append the original string to the list corresponding to that key.

    The algorithm uses the binary exponentiation technique, which is a faster method of calculating x^n compared to the naive approach. It relies on the process of repeatedly multiplying the current product by itself and updating it after each iteration. The loop iterates through the bits of the exponent n, from the least significant to the most significant. If the current bit of n is 1, the result is multiplied by the current product. At the end of the loop, the current product is updated by squaring it. This process continues until all bits of the exponent have been processed.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log(n)) because the loop iterates through the bits of n, and the number of bits in n is proportional to the logarithm of n. The space complexity is O(1), as the space used by the temporary variables does not depend on the size of n.

3. **Negative Exponents:**

When placing a queen, check if that position is safe from all previously placed queens in terms of the horizontal, diagonal, and anti-diagonal directions. If the selected position is safe, move on to the next column and try to place another queen there. If no safe positions are found in the current column, then go back to the previous column and move the queen to another safe position.

1. Maintain an array `cols` storing the row indices of placed queens. The index in this array represents the column the queen is placed in. This ensures that no two queens are placed in the same column.
2. Recursively place queens (column-wise).
3. Check for a safe position for each queen in the current column:
   a. Check for same row (`cols[i] == row`).
   b. Check for diagonal attack (`abs(i - col) == abs(cols[i] - row)`).
4. If the current position is safe, place the queen in the current column at the current row position, and continue to place the next queen.
5. If all queens are placed, increment the solution count.
6. If the recursive call finishes, backtrack by removing the queen from the current column and move on to the next row in the same column.
7. The base case is when the `cols` size equals `n`, meaning all queens have been placed safely; increment the count.

*   `1 <= n <= 9` John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","I'm here to help you with your coding problem. Let's tackle the n-queens puzzle. The goal is to place n queens on an n×n chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Since queens can move any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, we need to ensure that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

To solve this, we can use a backtracking approach. Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Representation**: We'll represent the chessboard as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row. Initially, all positions are empty.

2. **Placement Rules**:
   - No two queens in the same row.
   - No two queens in the same column.
   - No two queens on the same diagonals.

3. **Backtracking**:
   - We'll try to place queens row by row.
   - For each row, we'll check each column to see if it's safe to place a queen there.
   - If it's safe, we'll place the queen and move to the next row.
   - If it's not safe, we'll try the next column.
   - If we've placed queens in all rows successfully, we've found a valid solution.

4. **Checking Safety**:
   - To check if a position is safe, we need to ensure that no other queen is in the same column or on the diagonals.
   - We can optimize this by keeping track of the columns and diagonals that are already under attack.

5. **Optimizations**:
   - Since we're placing one queen per row, we don't need to check rows.
   - We can use sets to keep track of occupied columns and diagonals.

Let's proceed to implement this in Python. I'll write the code step by step, explaining each part.

## Final Solution
To solve the n-queens puzzle, we need to place n queens on an n×n chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

### Approach
1. **Backtracking**:
   - We will use a backtracking approach to place queens one by one in different rows.
   - For each row, we will check each column to see if it is safe to place a queen there.
   - If it is safe, we place the queen and move to the next row.
   - If it is not safe, we try the next column.
   - If queens are successfully placed in all rows, we have found a valid solution.

2. **Safety Check**:
   - We need to ensure that no two queens are in the same column or diagonals.
   - We will use sets to keep track of occupied columns and diagonals.

For each element, we compare the sum of the current_sum with the element itself, and select the maximum of the two. This helps us to decide whether to continue the current contiguous subarray or start a new one from that element. Then, we compare the new current_sum with our global max_sum, and update max_sum if we find a larger value.

In the end, max_sum contains the largest sum of the contiguous subarray.

Kadane's Algorithm is an efficient way to solve this problem. The main idea is to iterate through the array, keeping track of the current subarray sum.

So, for example, if I have a 3x3 matrix with numbers 1 through 9, I should return [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]. Another example is a 3x4 matrix, and the output should be [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7].

First, I need to understand what spiral order means. If I visualize the matrix, spiral order would be starting from the top-left corner and moving right, then down, then left, and then up, continuing this pattern inward until all elements are traversed.

So, for a 3x3 matrix:

1 2 3

4 5 6

7 8 9

Starting from 1, move right to 2, 3, then down to 6, right to 9, down to 9, then left to 8, up to 7, and finally right to 4 and down to 5.

Wait, no, in the example, it's [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]. Let me see: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 8 -> 7 -> 4 -> 5. So, starting top-left, moving right, then down, then left, then up, and so on, inward.

Another example, 3x4 matrix:

1  2  3  4

5  6  7  8

9 10 11 12

Output should be [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7].

So, similar pattern: right, down, left, up, and so on.

Constraints are small: m and n are between 1 and 10, and elements are between -100 and 100. So, no need to worry about very large matrices.

I need to think about how to implement this in code. One way is to simulate the spiral traversal by keeping track of the current direction and turning corners when I reach the matrix boundaries or already visited cells.

Perhaps I can define four directions: right, down, left, up, and cycle through them when needed.

I'll need to keep track of the current position in the matrix and the current direction.

Let me think about initializing variables:

- Define four directions: right (0), down (1), left (2), up (3).

- Start at position (0,0), direction right.

- Create a list to store the result.

- Mark cells as visited to avoid revisiting them.

But marking visited cells might be inefficient, especially since the matrix is small.

Another approach is to keep track of the boundaries: top, bottom, left, and right limits.

As I traverse the matrix in layers, updating these boundaries.

For example, in the first layer:

- Traverse from left to right on the top row.

- Then, traverse from top to bottom on the rightmost column.

- Then, if bottom > top, traverse from right to left on the bottom row.

- Then, if right > left, traverse from bottom to top on the leftmost column.

- Then, move to the next inner layer by incrementing top and left, and decrementing bottom and right.

This seems like a systematic way to handle the spiral traversal.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Initialize variables: top = 0, bottom = m-1, left = 0, right = n-1.

2. While top <= bottom and left <= right:

a. Traverse from left to right on the top row.

b. Increment top.

c. Traverse from top to bottom on the rightmost column.

d. Decrement right.

e. If top <= bottom, traverse from right to left on the bottom row.

f. Decrement bottom.

g. If left <= right, traverse from bottom to top on the leftmost column.

h. Increment left.

3. Return the result list.

Let me test this logic with the first example:

Matrix:

1 2 3

4 5 6

7 8 9

Initialize: top=0, bottom=2, left=0, right=2

First loop:

- Traverse top row: 1,2,3

- Increment top: top=1

- Traverse right column: 6,9

- Decrement right: right=1

- Since top <= bottom, traverse bottom row: 9,8,7

- Decrement bottom: bottom=1

- Since left <= right, traverse left column: 7,4

- Increment left: left=1

Second loop:

- Traverse top row: 5

- Increment top: top=2

- Traverse right column: nothing, since right=1 and left=1

- Decrement right: right=0

- Since top <= bottom: 2 <=1 is False

- So, stop

Result: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5] which matches the example.

Another example:

Matrix:

1  2  3  4

5  6  7  8

9 10 11 12

Initialize: top=0, bottom=2, left=0, right=3

First loop:

- Traverse top row: 1,2,3,4

- Increment top: top=1

- Traverse right column: 8,12

- Decrement right: right=2

- Since top <= bottom, traverse bottom row: 12,11,10,9

- Decrement bottom: bottom=1

- Since left <= right, traverse left column: 9,5

- Increment left: left=1

Second loop:

- Traverse top row: 6,7

- Increment top: top=2

- Traverse right column: nothing, since right=2 and left=1

- Decrement right: right=1

- Since top <= bottom: 2 <=1 is False

- So, stop

Result: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7] which matches the second example.

Looks good.

Now, I need to implement this in Python.

I need to handle the traversal in each direction correctly.

Let me think about how to traverse each side:

- Traverse top row: from left to right

- Traverse right column: from top to bottom

- Traverse bottom row: from right to left (if top <= bottom)

- Traverse left column: from bottom to top (if left <= right)

I need to make sure that I don't go out of bounds, hence the conditions on top, bottom, left, right.

I should also consider edge cases:

- Single row: m=1, n=4 => [1,2,3,4]

- Single column: m=3, n=1 => [1,2,3]

- Single element: m=1, n=1 => [1]

- Empty matrix: m=0 or n=0 => []

But according to constraints, m and n are at least 1, so no empty matrices.

Let me try to write pseudocode:

def spiralOrder(matrix):

result = []

if not matrix or not matrix[0]:

return result

top = 0

bottom = len(matrix) - 1

left = 0

right = len(matrix[0]) - 1

while top <= bottom and left <= right:

# Traverse top row

for col in range(left, right+1):

result.append(matrix[top][col])

top += 1

# Traverse right column

for row in range(top, bottom+1):

result.append(matrix[row][right])

right -= 1

# Traverse bottom row, if needed

if top <= bottom:

for col in range(right, left-1, -1):

result.append(matrix[bottom][col])

bottom -= 1

# Traverse left column, if needed

if left <= right:

for row in range(bottom, top-1, -1):

result.append(matrix[row][left])

left += 1

return result

This seems consistent with my earlier plan.

Let me test this pseudocode with the first example:

matrix = [

[1,2,3],

[4,5,6],

[7,8,9]

]

top=0, bottom=2, left=0, right=2

First loop:

- Traverse top row: 1,2,3; top=1

- Traverse right column: 6,9; right=1

- Traverse bottom row: 9,8,7; bottom=1

- Traverse left column: 7,4; left=1

Second loop:

- Traverse top row: 5; top=2

- Traverse right column: (no-op)

- Exit

Result: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

Good.

Another test:

matrix = [

[1,2,3,4],

[5,6,7,8],

[9,10,11,12]

]

top=0, bottom=2, left=0, right=3

First loop:

- Traverse top row: 1,2,3,4; top=1

- Traverse right column: 8,12; right=2

- Traverse bottom row: 12,11,10,9; bottom=1

- Traverse left column: 9,5; left=1

Second loop:

- Traverse top row: 6,7; top=2

- Traverse right column: (no-op)

- Exit

Result: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]

Matches the second example.

Edge case: single row

matrix = [

[1,2,3,4]

]

top=0, bottom=0, left=0, right=3

First loop:

- Traverse top row: 1,2,3,4; top=1

- Since top > bottom, exit

Result: [1,2,3,4]

Good.

Single column:

matrix = [

[1],

[2],

[3]

]

top=0, bottom=2, left=0, right=0

First loop:

- Traverse top row: 1; top=1

- Traverse right column: 2,3; right=-1

- Exit

Result: [1,2,3]

Wait, in traverse right column, row range is from top=1 to bottom=2:

- matrix[1][0]=2

- matrix[2][0]=3

Then, traverse bottom row: since top=1 <= bottom=2, traverse from right to left: col from right=-1 to left=0, but since right < left, no traversal.

Then, traverse left column: since left=1 <= right=-1, no traversal.

So, result is [1,2,3], which is correct.

Another edge case: single element

matrix = [

[1]

]

top=0, bottom=0, left=0, right=0

First loop:

- Traverse top row: 1; top=1

- Exit

Result: [1]

Good.

Another edge case: m=2, n=2

matrix = [

[1,2],

[3,4]

]

top=0, bottom=1, left=0, right=1

First loop:

- Traverse top row: 1,2; top=1

- Traverse right column: 4; right=0

- Traverse bottom row: 4,3; bottom=0

- Traverse left column: 3; left=1

Second loop:

- top=1, bottom=0 => exit

Result: [1,2,4,3]

Wait, but according to spiral order, it should be [1,2,4,3].

Yes, that's correct.

Another test: m=3, n=4

matrix = [

[1,2,3,4],

[5,6,7,8],

[9,10,11,12]

]

As before, result is [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]

Looks good.

I think this approach is solid.

Now, time to implement it in Python.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to return all elements of a given m x n matrix in spiral order. This involves traversing the matrix in a clockwise spiral starting from the top-left corner.

### Approach
1. **Initialize Boundaries**: Define four boundaries to keep track of the current spiral layer - `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.
2. ** Traverse Layers**: While the `top` is less than or equal to `bottom` and `left` is less than or equal to `right`, perform the following steps:
   - Traverse from left to right along the top row.
   - Increment the `top` boundary.
   - Traverse from top to bottom along the right column.
   - Decrement the `right` boundary.
   - If `top` is less than or equal to `bottom`, traverse from right to left along the bottom row.
   - Decrement the `bottom` boundary.
   - If `left` is less than or equal to `right`, traverse from bottom to top along the left column.
   - Increment the `left` boundary.
3. **Collect Elements**: Append the elements to a result list in the order specified by the above traversals.

Each position in the array tells me the maximum number of steps I can jump from that position. Okay, let's see.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. I have an array of integers, where each integer represents the maximum jump length from that position. I start at the first index, and I need to reach the last index. I need to return true if it's possible, and false otherwise.

Looking at the examples:

1. For nums = [2,3,1,1,4], it's possible to reach the end. One way is to jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

2. For nums = [3,2,1,0,4], it's impossible to reach the end. No matter what, I always end up at index 3, which has a jump length of 0, so I can't go further.

Alright, so I need to find a way to traverse the array from the start to the end, using the jump lengths specified at each position.

I think a good approach would be to keep track of the farthest position I can reach at each step. I'll iterate through the array, and at each index, I'll calculate the maximum reach from that position. If at any point, the maximum reach is less than the current index, that means I can't proceed further, and I should return false. If I can reach or surpass the last index, then return true.

Let me try to formalize this:

- Initialize a variable max_reach to store the farthest index that can be reached. Set it to 0 initially.

- Iterate through the array from index 0 to n-1.

- For each index i, if i is beyond max_reach, then return false because we can't reach this index.

- Update max_reach to be the maximum of max_reach and (i + nums[i]).

- If max_reach is greater than or equal to the last index, return true.

Does this make sense?

Let's test this logic with the first example:

nums = [2,3,1,1,4]

- Initialize max_reach = 0

- i=0: max_reach = max(0, 0+2) = 2

- i=1: 1 <= 2, max_reach = max(2, 1+3) = 4

- i=2: 2 <= 4, max_reach = max(4, 2+1) = 4

- i=3: 3 <= 4, max_reach = max(4, 3+1) = 4

- i=4: 4 <= 4, reach the end. Return true.

Good.

Now, the second example:

nums = [3,2,1,0,4]

- Initialize max_reach = 0

- i=0: max_reach = max(0, 0+3) = 3

- i=1: 1 <= 3, max_reach = max(3, 1+2) = 3

- i=2: 2 <= 3, max_reach = max(3, 2+1) = 3

- i=3: 3 <= 3, max_reach = max(3, 3+0) = 3

- i=4: 4 > 3, can't reach this index. Return false.

Perfect, matches the expected output.

I think this is a solid approach. It's efficient because it only requires a single pass through the array, and it uses O(1) extra space, which is great for the constraints given (array length up to 10^4).

Let me think about edge cases:

1. nums = [0], single element. Since we start at index 0, and it's also the last index, should return true.

- max_reach = 0, which is equal to the last index (0), so return true. Correct.

2. nums = [0,1], starting at index 0 with jump length 0, can't move to index 1. Should return false.

- max_reach = 0

- i=1: 1 > 0, return false. Correct.

3. nums = [2,0,0], should return true.

- max_reach = 2 (from index 0)

- i=1: 1 <= 2, max_reach = max(2, 1+0) = 2

- i=2: 2 <= 2, reach the end. Return true.

4. nums = [1,1,1,0], should return true.

- max_reach = 1 (from index 0)

- i=3: 3 <= 3, reach the end. Return true.

5. nums = [1,0,1,0], should return false.

- i=1: 1 <= 1, max_reach = max(1, 1+0) = 1

- i=2: 2 > 1, can't reach index 2. Return false.

Seems like the approach handles these cases correctly.

I should also consider the constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4

- 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

My approach should work within these limits since it's O(n) time and O(1) space.

I don't think I need to consider any other special cases. Let's proceed to implement the code.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can reach the last index of an array from the first index, given that each element in the array represents the maximum jump length at that position.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: We start with a variable `max_reach` set to 0, which indicates the farthest index we can reach starting from the first position.
2. **Traversal**: We iterate through the array from the beginning to the end.
   - For each index `i`, if `i` is within `max_reach`, we update `max_reach` to be the maximum of its current value and `i + nums[i]` (the farthest index we can reach from the current position).
   - If `i` is beyond `max_reach`, it means we cannot reach this index, and thus we cannot proceed further. In this case, we return `false`.
3. **Check for success**: If `max_reach` is greater than or equal to the last index, we return `true`; otherwise, we return `false`.

The task is to take a list of intervals, where each interval is represented by a start and end time, and merge all overlapping intervals to produce a list of non-overlapping intervals that cover all the inputs.

First, I need to understand what it means for two intervals to overlap. If I have two intervals, say [1,3] and [2,6], they overlap because the end of the first interval (3) is greater than or equal to the start of the second interval (2). In this case, they can be merged into a single interval [1,6].

Looking at the first example:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

Here, [1,3] and [2,6] overlap and can be merged into [1,6]. The other intervals do not overlap with each other, so they remain as they are.

In the second example:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]

Output: [[1,5]]

Even though the end of the first interval is equal to the start of the second interval, they are considered overlapping and can be merged into [1,5].

From these examples, it seems that if the end of one interval is greater than or equal to the start of the next interval, they can be merged.

Now, to approach this problem, I need to think about how to efficiently merge these intervals. One way is to sort the intervals based on their start times. Once they are sorted, I can iterate through the list and merge overlapping intervals on the go.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Sort the intervals based on their start times.

2. Initialize a list to hold the merged intervals.

3. Add the first interval to the merged list.

4. For each subsequent interval, check if it overlaps with the last interval in the merged list.

- If it does, merge them by updating the end time of the last interval in the merged list to the maximum of the current end time and the end time of the interval to be merged.

- If it doesn't, add the current interval to the merged list.

5. Continue this process until all intervals have been processed.

This seems straightforward. Let me consider some edge cases to ensure that this approach works.

Edge Case 1: All intervals overlap.

For example, intervals = [[1,10],[2,7],[3,5]]

Expected output: [[1,10]]

Edge Case 2: No intervals overlap.

For example, intervals = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]

Expected output: [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]

Edge Case 3: Intervals are already merged.

For example, intervals = [[1,5],[6,10]]

Expected output: [[1,5],[6,10]]

Edge Case 4: Intervals are empty or have only one interval.

For example, intervals = []

Expected output: []

Or, intervals = [[1,2]]

Expected output: [[1,2]]

I should make sure that my code handles these cases correctly.

Also, I need to consider the constraints:

- 1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4

- intervals[i].length == 2

- 0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^4

Given these constraints, I need to ensure that my solution is efficient enough, probably O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of intervals.

Now, let's think about implementing this in Python.

First, I'll sort the intervals based on the start time.

Then, I'll initialize a list with the first interval.

Then, for each subsequent interval, I'll compare its start time with the end time of the last interval in the merged list.

- If the current interval's start time is less than or equal to the end time of the last merged interval, I'll merge them by updating the end time of the last merged interval to the maximum of the two end times.

- Otherwise, I'll add the current interval to the merged list.

Finally, I'll return the merged list.

Let me try to write some pseudocode for this:","def merge(intervals):

I need to find the length of the last word in a string that consists of words and spaces. The string will always have at least one word, so I don't need to worry about empty string cases.

First, I need to understand what a ""word"" is in this context. According to the problem, a word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only. So, words are separated by spaces.

Let me look at the examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

Input: s = ""Hello World""

Output: 5

Explanation: The last word is ""World"" with length 5.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""   fly me   to   the moon   ""

Output: 4

Explanation: The last word is ""moon"" with length 4.

Example 3:

Input: s = ""luffy is still joyboy""

Output: 6

Explanation: The last word is ""joyboy"" with length 6.

From these examples, it seems that I need to ignore any trailing spaces after the last word and find the length of the last sequence of non-space characters.

One way to approach this is to split the string by spaces and then find the last non-empty string in the resulting list.

In Python, I can use the split() function, which splits the string at spaces by default and returns a list of words.

For example:

s = ""Hello World""

s.split() => [""Hello"", ""World""]

Then, the last word is ""World"", and its length is 5.

Similarly, for s = ""   fly me   to   the moon   ""

s.split() => [""fly"", ""me"", ""to"", ""the"", ""moon""]

Last word is ""moon"", length 4.

And for s = ""luffy is still joyboy""

s.split() => [""luffy"", ""is"", ""still"", ""joyboy""]

Last word is ""joyboy"", length 6.

This seems straightforward. But I need to consider if there are any trailing spaces at the end of the string.

Wait, in the first example, there is a space at the end: ""Hello World "". So, s.split() should still correctly identify ""World"" as the last word.

Let me check that.

s = ""Hello World ""

s.split() => [""Hello"", ""World""]

Yes, split() ignores trailing spaces.

Similarly, if there are multiple spaces between words, split() will ignore them and only consider one space as a delimiter.

For example, s = ""   fly me   to   the moon   ""

s.split() => [""fly"", ""me"", ""to"", ""the"", ""moon""]

Perfect.

So, my plan is:

1. Use s.split() to get a list of words.

2. Find the last element in that list.

3. Return its length.

But I should consider if the string has only one word. For example:

s = ""hello""

s.split() => [""hello""]

Last word is ""hello"", length 5.

That works.

What if the string has leading spaces?

s = ""   hello""

s.split() => [""hello""]

Still works.

What if the string has multiple words with varying spaces?

s = ""hello    world""

s.split() => [""hello"", ""world""]

Still works.

Seems solid.

Alternatively, I could iterate from the end of the string, ignoring spaces until I find a non-space character, then start counting the length until I hit another space or the start of the string.

But using split() seems simpler and more efficient.

Let me think about the constraints.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10^4

s consists of only English letters and spaces''.

There will be at least one word in s.

So, no need to handle empty strings or strings with only spaces.

Wait, it says there will be at least one word in s, so I don't need to worry about strings with only spaces.

But in programming, it's always good to consider edge cases.

But according to the problem, I can assume there is at least one word.

Time complexity-wise, split() is O(n), where n is the length of the string, since it needs to traverse the entire string.

Space complexity is also O(n), as it creates a list of words.

But given that n <= 10^4, which is acceptable, I don't think there are performance issues.

Is there a way to optimize this further?

Well, if I iterate from the end, I can stop once I've counted the last word, without processing the entire string.

Let's think about that.

Approach 2:

1. Start from the end of the string.

2. Ignore any spaces until I find a non-space character.

3. Start counting the length until I hit a space or reach the beginning of the string.

This way, I'm only traversing the string until I've counted the last word, which could be faster for strings with very long lengths and long last words.

But given that n <= 10^4, it's not a big deal.

Still, it's good to consider.

Let me try to implement this logic.

Example 1:

s = ""Hello World ""

Start from the end:

Index 12:'' -> ignore

Index 11: 'd' -> start counting: length = 1

Index 10: 'l' -> length = 2

Index 9: 'o' -> length = 3

Index 8: 'r' -> length = 4

Index 7: 'W' -> length = 5

Index 6:'' -> stop, return length 5

Perfect.

Example 2:

s = ""   fly me   to   the moon   ""

Start from the end:

Index 17:'' -> ignore

Index 16: 'n' -> start counting: length = 1

Index 15: 'o' -> length = 2

Index 14: 'o' -> length = 3

Index 13:'m' -> length = 4

Index 12:'' -> stop, return length 4

Good.

Example 3:

s = ""luffy is still joyboy""

Start from the end:

Index 15: 'y' -> start counting: length = 1

Index 14: 'o' -> length = 2

Index 13: 'b' -> length = 3

Index 12: 'o' -> length = 4

Index 11: 'j' -> length = 5

Index 10:'' -> stop, return length 5

Wait, but in the explanation, the output is 6 for ""joyboy"".

Wait, index 15 is 'y', index 14 'o', index 13 'y', index 12 'b', index 11 'o', index 10 'j', index 9''.

So, counting from index 15 to index 9:

'y' -> 1

'o' -> 2

'y' -> 3

'b' -> 4

'o' -> 5

'j' -> 6

Then index 9 is'', so stop and return length 6.

Wait, in my earlier count, I stopped at index 10, but that was incorrect.

I need to make sure I count all characters until I hit a space or the beginning.

So, in code, I need to loop backwards, first ignore spaces, then start counting non-space characters until I hit a space or reach the beginning.

This seems manageable.

In code, I can have a variable to keep track of the length, starting from the end, skipping spaces, then counting non-space characters.

Pseudocode:

def lengthOfLastWord(s: str) -> int:

i = len(s) - 1

length = 0

# Skip trailing spaces

while i >= 0 and s[i] =='':

i -= 1

# Count the last word

while i >= 0 and s[i]!='':

length += 1

i -= 1

return length

Let me test this with the examples.

Example 1:

s = ""Hello World ""

Indices: 0: 'H'... 11: 'd', 12:''

Start with i = 12, s[12] ='', skip.

i = 11, s[11] = 'd', start counting: length = 1

i = 10, s[10] = 'l', length = 2

i = 9, s[9] = 'o', length = 3

i = 8, s[8] = 'r', length = 4

i = 7, s[7] = 'W', length = 5

i = 6, s[6] ='', stop, return 5

Correct.

Example 2:

s = "" fly me   to   the moon ""

Indices: 0:''... 17: 'n', 18:''

Start with i = 18, s[18] ='', skip.

i = 17, s[17] = 'n', start counting: length = 1

i = 16, s[16] = 'o', length = 2

i = 15, s[15] = 'o', length = 3

i = 14, s[14] ='m', length = 4

i = 13, s[13] ='', stop, return 4

Correct.

Example 3:

s = ""luffy is still joyboy""

Indices: 0: 'l'... 15: 'y', 16: ''

Start with i = 16, s[16] = '', which is not a space, but in Python, indexing beyond the string raises an error. So, I need to make sure i >= 0.

Wait, in Python, s[16] would raise an IndexError for s of length 16.

So, s = ""luffy is still joyboy"" has length 16.

Indices from 0 to 15.

s[15] = 'y'

s[14] = 'j'

...

So, start with i = 15, s[15] = 'y', start counting: length = 1

i = 14, s[14] = 'o', length = 2

i = 13, s[13] = 'b', length = 3

i = 12, s[12] = 'o', length = 4

i = 11, s[11] = 'y', length = 5

i = 10, s[10] ='', stop, return 5

Wait, but the explanation says output is 6 for ""joyboy"".

Wait, ""joyboy"" is 6 letters.

Wait, indices:

0: 'l'

1: 'u'

2: 'f'

3: 'f'

4: 'y'

5:''

6: 'i'

7:'s'

8:''

9:'s'

10: 't'

11: 'i'

12: 'l'

13: 'l'

14:''

15: 'j'

16: 'o'

17: 'y'

18: 'b'

19: 'o'

20: 'y'

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the length of s.

Wait, ""luffy is still joyboy"" has 16 characters:

l u f f y   i s   s t i l l   j o y b o y

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15

So, s[15] = 'y'

s[14] = 'o'

s[13] = 'b'

s[12] = 'o'

s[11] = 'j'

s[10] =''

So, starting from i=15:

s[15] = 'y', length=1

s[14] = 'o', length=2

s[13] = 'b', length=3

s[12] = 'o', length=4

s[11] = 'j', length=5

s[10] ='', stop, return 5

But the explanation says output is 6.

Wait, perhaps there's a space missing in the representation.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's ""luffy is still joyboy"", which seems to have no trailing space, but in the explanation, it's ""luffy is still joyboy "", with a trailing space, which is not present in the input string.

Wait, checking the problem statement again:

Example 3:

Input: s = ""luffy is still joyboy""

Output: 6

Explanation: The last word is ""joyboy"" with length 6.

Wait, but in the input, there's no trailing space, so in my code, it should work as above.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the indices.

Let me count again:

s = ""l u f f y   i s   s t i l l   j o y b o y""

Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15

s[15] = 'y'

s[14] = 'o'

s[13] = 'b'

s[12] = 'o'

s[11] = 'y'

s[10] = 'j'

s[9] =''

s[8] = 'l'

s[7] = 'l'

s[6] = 'i'

s[5] = 'l'

s[4] =''

s[3] ='s'

s[2] = 't'

s[1] = 'i'

s[0] ='s'

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the positions.

Wait, maybe the string is ""l u f f y   i s   s t i l l   j o y b o y"" without any trailing space, so s[15] = 'y', s[14] = 'o', s[13] = 'b', s[12] = 'o', s[11] = 'j', s[10] = 'y', s[9] ='', and so on.

Wait, now ""joyboy"" is s[10] to s[15]: 'j','o','y','b','o','y' -> 6 characters.

But in my earlier count, I had s[10] = 'j', which is correct.

So, starting from i=15:

s[15] = 'y', length=1

s[14] = 'o', length=2

s[13] = 'b', length=3

s[12] = 'o', length=4

s[11] = 'j', length=5

s[10] = 'y', length=6

s[9] ='', stop, return 6

Ah, I must have made a mistake earlier. Yes, s[10] is 'j', not a space.

Wait, perhaps the string is ""l u f f y   i s   s t i l l   j o y b o y"" with no space before ""joyboy"".

Wait, in the string ""luffy is still joyboy"", there is a space before ""joyboy"".

Wait, ""still joyboy"": there is a space before ""joyboy"".

So, s[9] ='', s[10] = 'j', s[11] = 'o', etc.

So, starting from i=15:

s[15] = 'y', length=1

s[14] = 'o', length=2

s[13] = 'b', length=3

s[12] = 'o', length=4

s[11] = 'j', length=5

s[10] = 'y', length=6

s[9] ='', stop, return 6

Perfect, matches the expected output.

So, my approach seems correct.

Now, comparing the two approaches:

Approach 1: Use s.split() and get the last element's length.

Approach 2: Iterate from the end, skip spaces, count the last word.

Both are O(n) in time complexity, but Approach 2 might be slightly more efficient since it doesn't create a list of all words, but directly finds the last word's length.

In terms of space, Approach 2 uses constant space, while Approach 1 uses O(n) space for the list of words.

Given that n <= 10^4, it's not a big deal, but Approach 2 is still better in terms of space.

Also, Approach 2 avoids the overhead of splitting the string, which might be faster in practice, although the difference would be negligible for n=10^4.

But in terms of code readability, Approach 1 is simpler and more straightforward.

Given that, I think either approach is acceptable, but I'll go with Approach 2 for better space efficiency.

Now, let's think about edge cases.

Edge Case 1: Single word with trailing spaces.

s = ""hello ""

Expected output: 5

Process:

Skip trailing spaces, then count ""hello"" which is length 5.

Edge Case 2: Multiple spaces between words.

s = ""a b c ""

Expected output: 1

Process:

Skip trailing spaces, count ""c"", length 1.

Edge Case 3: Word with multiple characters, no trailing space.

s = ""hello""

Expected output: 5

Process:

No trailing spaces to skip, count ""hello"", length 5.

Edge Case 4: Spaces at the beginning.

s = ""   hello""

Expected output: 5

Process:

Skip trailing spaces (none), then count ""hello"", length 5.

Edge Case 5: Multiple words with varying spaces.

s = ""a   b    c   ""

Expected output: 1

Process:

Skip trailing spaces, count ""c"", length 1.

Seems all edge cases are handled correctly.

Now, to implement this in Python.

I need to define a function:

def lengthOfLastWord(s: str) -> int:

# Implementation here

I need to make sure to handle the indices correctly to avoid index out of range errors.

In Python, strings are zero-indexed, and negative indices count from the end.

But for clarity, I'll use a forward index.

I'll start from the end of the string, move to the beginning, first skipping any spaces, then counting the last word.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Initialize a variable i to the index of the last character of the string.

2. While i is greater than or equal to 0 and s[i] is a space, decrement i. This skips trailing spaces.

3. Initialize a variable length to 0.

4. While i is greater than or equal to 0 and s[i] is not a space, increment length and decrement i. This counts the last word.

5. Return length.

Let me write this in code.

def lengthOfLastWord(s: str) -> int:

i = len(s) - 1

while i >= 0 and s[i] =='':

i -= 1

length = 0

while i >= 0 and s[i]!='':

length += 1

i -= 1

return length

Let me test this function with the examples.

Test Case 1:

s = ""Hello World ""

Expected Output: 5

Actual Output: 5

Test Case 2:

s = "" fly me   to   the moon ""

Expected Output: 4

Actual Output: 4

Test Case 3:

s = ""luffy is still joyboy""

Expected Output: 6

Actual Output: 6

All test cases pass.

Now, let's consider the time and space complexity.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string. In the worst case, we might traverse the entire string if the last word is at the beginning.

Space Complexity: O(1), since we're only using a few variables for indexing and length counting.

This seems acceptable given the constraints.

Is there any way to optimize this further?

Well, in Python, strings are immutable, so there's no way to avoid traversing the string to some extent.

But since we're already using an efficient approach, I don't think further optimization is necessary.

Now, I need to make sure that the function handles all possible edge cases correctly.

Edge Case 1:

s = ""a""

Expected Output: 1

Actual Output: 1

Edge Case 2:

s = "" a""

Expected Output: 1

Actual Output: 1

Edge Case 3:

s = ""a ""

Expected Output: 1

Actual Output: 1

Edge Case 4:

s = ""abc def ghi ""

Expected Output: 3

Actual Output: 3

Edge Case 5:

s = ""abc def ghi""

Expected Output: 3

Actual Output: 3

Edge Case 6:

s = ""  abc  ""

Expected Output: 3

Actual Output: 3

All these edge cases seem to be handled correctly.

I think this solution is solid.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the last word in a string that consists of words and spaces. 

### Approach
1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - A word is defined as a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.
   - The string will have at least one word.

2. **Initial Plan**:
   - Use the `split()` method to divide the string into words and then find the length of the last element in the list.
   
3. **Optimized Plan**:
   - Iterate from the end of the string, ignoring any trailing spaces.
   - Start counting the length of the last word until a space or the start of the string is encountered.
   
4. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string, as we may need to traverse the entire string in the worst case.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few variables for indexing and length counting.

**Constraints:**

In a spiral order, we fill the matrix in a way that we start from the top-left corner and move right, then down, then left, and then up, repeating this pattern inwards until the entire matrix is filled.

Given that, I need to create a function that, for a given positive integer n, generates such a matrix.

First, I'll think about how to approach this. Since we're dealing with a spiral pattern, I need to keep track of the directions I'm moving in and when to turn.

I can define the directions as right, down, left, and up, and cycle through them accordingly.

I'll need to keep track of the current position in the matrix and the current direction. Also, I need to ensure that I don't go out of bounds or overwrite any previously filled cells.

Let me consider the steps I need to take:

1. Create an n x n matrix initialized with zeros or any placeholder value.

2. Start from the top-left corner (0,0).

3. Define the directions in order: right, down, left, up.

4. Keep moving in the current direction until you reach the boundary or a cell that's already filled.

5. When you can't move in the current direction, turn to the next direction in the cycle.

6. Continue this process until all cells are filled.

I need to handle the turning mechanism properly. Essentially, whenever I can't move forward in the current direction, I should turn right (change to the next direction in the cycle).

Also, I need to keep a counter that starts at 1 and increments by 1 for each cell filled, up to n².

Let me try to outline this in pseudocode first:","function generateMatrix(n):

    # Initialize the matrix with zeros

    matrix = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]

        num += 1

Initially, we fill out the first row and first column of the `dp` array with 1 since there is only one way to reach any cell in the first row or first column: by moving either right along the first row or down along the first column.

Then, for every other cell in the `dp` array, we can calculate the number of unique paths to that cell by summing the number of unique paths to the cell above it and to the cell to its left. We can do this because the robot can only move down or right, so the paths to the current cell must have come from those two directions.

Finally, we return the value at the bottom-right corner of the `dp` array, which represents the number of unique paths the robot can take to reach the destination.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:

2. **Base Case**:
   - The number of paths to reach any cell in the first row is 1 because the robot can only move right.
   - Similarly, the number of paths to reach any cell in the first column is 1 because the robot can only move down.

3. **Fill the DP Table**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)` (starting from `(1, 1)`), the number of unique paths is the sum of the paths from the cell above `(i-1, j)` and the cell to the left `(i, j-1)`.

The goal is to find out how many unique paths the robot can take from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, moving only right or down, and avoiding any cells marked as obstacles.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. We have a 2D grid where each cell can either be empty (0) or an obstacle (1). The robot starts at the top-left cell and needs to reach the bottom-right cell. It can only move right or down, and it can't pass through obstacles.

I recall that in problems involving counting paths in a grid, dynamic programming is often a useful approach. The idea is to build up the number of paths to each cell based on the number of paths to the cells from which it can be reached.

So, I should consider creating a 2D array to store the number of unique paths to each cell. For the starting cell, the number of paths is 1, unless it's an obstacle, in which case it's 0. For each cell, the number of paths to it would be the sum of the paths to the cell directly above it and the cell directly to the left of it, provided those cells are not obstacles.

I need to handle the edges carefully. The first row and the first column need special attention because cells in these positions can only be reached from one direction unless there are obstacles in the way.

Let me think about the base cases:

1. If the starting cell (0,0) is an obstacle, then there are 0 paths to reach any cell because the robot can't even start.

2. If the grid has only one cell, which is the starting cell, and it's not an obstacle, then there is 1 path (staying in place).

3. If the grid has multiple cells, I need to iterate through each cell and calculate the number of paths based on the cells above and to the left, skipping obstacles.

I should also consider that if a cell is an obstacle, the number of paths to it is 0.

Let me sketch a small example to verify my approach.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We'll create a 2D array `dp` of the same size as the grid to store the minimum path sum to each cell.
   - The minimum path sum to the starting cell `(0, 0)` is simply `grid[0][0]`.

2. **Filling the first row**:
   - For cells in the first row, the only way to reach them is from the left, so `dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j]`.

3. **Filling the first column**:
   - For cells in the first column, the only way to reach them is from above, so `dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0]`.

4. **Filling the rest of the grid**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, the minimum path sum is the minimum of the path sum from the cell above `(i-1, j)` and the cell to the left `(i, j-1)`, plus the value of the current cell `grid[i][j]`.
   - So, `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]`.

   - The minimum path sum to reach the bottom-right corner will be in `dp[m-1][n-1]`.

**Output:** \[4,3,2,2\]
**Explanation:** The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be \[4,3,2,2\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** digits = \[9\]
**Output:** \[1,0\]
**Explanation:** The array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be \[1,0\].

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= digits.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= digits[i] <= 9`
*   `digits` does not contain any leading `0`'s. Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","So I've got this problem here. I have an array of digits that represent a large integer, and I need to increment this integer by one. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant, left to right, and there are no leading zeros. So, for example, [1,2,3] represents the number 123, and I need to return [1,2,4] after adding one.

First, I need to understand what it means to add one to a number represented in this way. Essentially, I'm starting from the least significant digit, which is the last element in the array, and adding one to it. If that digit is less than 9, I can just increment it by one and that's the answer. For example, in [1,2,3], the last digit is 3, which is less than 9, so adding one makes it 4, and the result is [1,2,4].

But what if the last digit is 9? If the last digit is 9, adding one would make it 10, which means I need to carry over the 1 to the next significant digit. For example, if the input is [1,2,9], adding one to the last digit (9) turns it into 10, so I set the last digit to 0 and add one to the second last digit (2), making it 3. So the result would be [1,3,0].

This carrying over can propagate through the array if there are multiple 9s at the end. For instance, if the input is [9,9,9], adding one would require carrying over through all digits, resulting in [1,0,0,0].

So, a general approach would be to start from the least significant digit (the end of the array), add one to it, and if it becomes 10, set it to 0 and carry over 1 to the next significant digit. I need to continue this process until I find a digit that is less than 9 or until I have carried over a 1 past the most significant digit.

In the case where all digits are 9, like [9,9,9], adding one would result in [1,0,0,0]. That means I need to extend the array by one digit at the beginning.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Start from the last element in the array.

2. Add one to it.

3. If the result is 10, set that digit to 0 and carry over 1 to the next significant digit.

4. Repeat step 3 for each significant digit as long as there is a carry.

5. If after processing all digits there is still a carry, insert a 1 at the beginning of the array.

6. Return the modified array.

Let me consider some examples to verify this approach.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3]

Process:

- Start with the last digit: 3 + 1 = 4

- Since 4 < 10, no carry, just return [1,2,4]

Correct.

Example 2:

Input: [4,3,2,1]

Process:

- Start with the last digit: 1 + 1 = 2

- Since 2 < 10, no carry, return [4,3,2,2]

Correct.

Example 3:

Input: [9]

Process:

- Start with the last digit: 9 + 1 = 10

- Set the last digit to 0 and carry over 1

- Since there are no more digits, insert 1 at the beginning: [1,0]

Correct.

Another example:

Input: [9,9,9]

Process:

- Last digit: 9 + 1 = 10 → set to 0, carry 1

- Second last digit: 9 + 1 = 10 → set to 0, carry 1

- Third last digit: 9 + 1 = 10 → set to 0, carry 1

- No more digits, insert 1 at the beginning: [1,0,0,0]

Correct.

Another example:

Input: [1,9,9]

Process:

- Last digit: 9 + 1 = 10 → set to 0, carry 1

- Second last digit: 9 + 1 = 10 → set to 0, carry 1

- Third last digit: 1 + 1 = 2 → set to 2, no carry

- Return [2,0,0]

Correct.

Seems like this approach works for these cases.

Now, in terms of implementation, I need to iterate through the array from the end to the beginning. In Python, I can use a loop that starts from the last index and moves to the first.

I'll need to handle the carry as I go along. If after processing all digits there is still a carry, I need to add a new digit at the beginning.

Let me think about the edge cases:

1. All digits are 9: [9,9,9] → [1,0,0,0]

2. Single digit less than 9: [1] → [2]

3. Single digit 9: [9] → [1,0]

4. Multiple digits with trailing 9s: [1,2,9,9] → [1,3,0,0]

5. All digits are 0: [0,0,0] → [0,0,1] (though the problem says there are no leading zeros, but to be safe)

Wait, the problem says: ""The large integer does not contain any leading 0's."" So I don't need to worry about leading zeros in the input.

But in the output, if I have to add a new digit at the beginning, it will be 1, which is fine.

Another consideration is the constraints:

- 1 <= digits.length <= 100

- 0 <= digits[i] <= 9

- No leading zeros.

So, the array can have up to 100 digits, which is manageable in Python since it can handle large integers.

I need to make sure that my code is efficient and doesn't have any unnecessary operations.

Let me try to write some pseudocode:","def plusOne(digits):

1. **Initialize Pointers and Variables:**
   - Use pointers to traverse the strings from right to left.
   - Initialize a carry variable to handle carry-over values.

2. **Iterate Through the Strings:**
   - Add corresponding digits from both strings along with the carry.
   - Compute the sum and the new carry.
   - Build the result string by appending the least significant digit of the sum.

3. **Handle Remaining Digits and Carry:**
   - If one string is longer than the other, continue adding the remaining digits.
   - After processing both strings, if there's a remaining carry, append it to the result.

   - Since we built the result from least significant digit to most significant digit, reverse the result string before returning it.

That means no pow(x, 0.5) or x**0.5 in Python. Alright, let's see how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what the square root of a number is. The square root of a number x is a number y such that y squared equals x. So, y * y = x. For example, the square root of 4 is 2 because 2 * 2 = 4.

Now, I need to find the largest integer y such that y * y <= x, because we have to round down to the nearest integer. For example, the square root of 8 is approximately 2.828, and rounding down gives us 2, since 2 * 2 = 4, which is less than or equal to 8, and 3 * 3 = 9, which is greater than 8.

So, my goal is to find the largest integer y where y * y <= x.

One way to do this is to iterate through all integers starting from 1 up to x, and check if their square is less than or equal to x. Once I find the point where y * y exceeds x, I know that the previous y was the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to x.

But this sounds inefficient, especially for large values of x, because it would require up to x iterations. Given that x can be up to 2^31 - 1, which is a very large number, this approach would not be practical due to time constraints.

I need a more efficient way to find the square root. Let's think about binary search. Binary search is efficient for searching in sorted arrays, and it works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

In this case, the possible values of y are from 0 to x, and I need to find the largest y where y * y <= x. This seems like a sorted range, so binary search could be applicable here.

Here's how I can apply binary search:

1. Initialize two pointers: low = 0 and high = x.

2. While low <= high:

a. Calculate mid = (low + high) // 2.

b. If mid * mid == x, I've found the exact square root, so return mid.

c. If mid * mid < x, set low = mid + 1, because I need to check for a larger y.

d. If mid * mid > x, set high = mid - 1, because y is too big.

3. After the loop, high should be the largest y where y * y <= x, so return high.

Wait a minute, let's verify this logic with an example.

Take x = 8.

- low = 0, high = 8

- mid = 4

- 4 * 4 = 16 > 8 → high = 3

- mid = 1

- 1 * 1 = 1 < 8 → low = 2

- mid = 2

- 2 * 2 = 4 < 8 → low = 3

- mid = 3

- 3 * 3 = 9 > 8 → high = 2

- Now low = 3, high = 2 → low > high, loop ends

- Return high, which is 2. Correct.

Another example: x = 4

- low = 0, high = 4

- mid = 2

- 2 * 2 = 4 == 4 → return 2. Perfect.

Edge case: x = 0

- low = 0, high = 0

- mid = 0

- 0 * 0 = 0 == 0 → return 0. Good.

Edge case: x = 1

- low = 0, high = 1

- mid = 0

- 0 * 0 = 0 < 1 → low = 1

- mid = 1

- 1 * 1 = 1 == 1 → return 1. Perfect.

Edge case: x = 2

- low = 0, high = 2

- mid = 1

- 1 * 1 = 1 < 2 → low = 2

- mid = 2

- 2 * 2 = 4 > 2 → high = 1

- low = 2, high = 1 → low > high → return high = 1. Correct, since sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, rounded down to 1.

This seems to work well. Now, I need to consider if there are any optimizations or special cases I need to handle.

One thing to note is that for very large x, computing mid * mid could result in integer overflow. In Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so this isn't an issue. But in languages like C++ or Java, I would need to handle this carefully.

Another consideration is that x can be 0, which should return 0, as the square root of 0 is 0.

Also, x can be 1, which should return 1.

I should also think about the time complexity. Since I'm using binary search, the time complexity is O(log x), which is much better than the initial linear approach.

Space complexity is O(1), as I'm only using a few variables.

I think this approach covers all the bases. Now, I'll proceed to implement this in Python.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to compute the square root of a non-negative integer `x` and round it down to the nearest integer without using any built-in exponent functions or operators.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: We need to find the largest integer `y` such that `y * y <= x`. This is equivalent to finding the floor of the square root of `x`.
2. **Binary Search**: Use binary search to efficiently find the square root.
    - Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to 0 and `x` respectively.
    - Iterate while `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
    - Calculate the midpoint `mid` and adjust the search range based on the comparison of `mid * mid` and `x`.
    - If `mid * mid` is equal to `x`, return `mid`.
    - If `mid * mid` is less than `x`, set `low` to `mid + 1`.
    - If `mid * mid` is greater than `x`, set `high` to `mid - 1`.
3. **Result**: When the loop ends, `high` will be the largest integer `y` such that `y * y <= x`.

*   The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer `target`, return `true` _if_ `target` _is in_ `matrix` _or_ `false` _otherwise_.

You must write a solution in `O(log(m * n))` time complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** matrix = \[\[1,3,5,7\],\[10,11,16,20\],\[23,30,34,60\]\], target = 3
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** matrix = \[\[1,3,5,7\],\[10,11,16,20\],\[23,30,34,60\]\], target = 13
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `m == matrix.length`
*   `n == matrix[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 100`
*   `-104 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 104` Additionally, the sky was clear that day.","So I've got this problem here. I have a 2D matrix where each row is sorted in non-decreasing order, and the first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row. I need to find if a given target integer is in this matrix, and I have to do it in O(log(m * n)) time complexity. That means I need an efficient searching algorithm, probably a binary search since the matrix is sorted in a specific way.

First, I need to understand the structure of the matrix. Each row is sorted, and the first element of each row is greater than the last element of the previous row. So, the entire matrix is sorted in a way that I can think of it as a single sorted array that has been broken into rows.

For example, in the first example:

matrix = [

[1, 3, 5, 7],

[10, 11, 16, 20],

[23, 30, 34, 60]

]

If I were to flatten this matrix into a single array, it would look like:

[1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 16, 20, 23, 30, 34, 60]

Which is sorted in non-decreasing order.

So, the idea is to perform a binary search on this flattened array. But since it's given in a 2D form, I need to map the 1D indices to 2D indices.

Let me think about how to do that.

First, I can calculate the total number of elements in the matrix, which is m * n.

Then, I can perform a binary search from 0 to m*n - 1.

Given an index in the flattened array, I can find its corresponding row and column in the matrix.

To find the row, I can do index // n, since there are n columns.

To find the column, I can do index % n.

So, for example, if m = 3, n = 4, and index = 5,

row = 5 // 4 = 1

col = 5 % 4 = 1

So, matrix[1][1] = 11

That seems correct.

Now, I can implement the binary search.

Initialize left = 0, right = m*n - 1

While left <= right:

mid = (left + right) // 2

row = mid // n

col = mid % n

if matrix[row][col] == target:

return True

elif matrix[row][col] < target:

left = mid + 1

else:

right = mid - 1

If the loop ends and no match is found, return False

This should work in O(log(m*n)) time, which is acceptable.

Let me test this logic with the first example.

matrix = [

[1, 3, 5, 7],

[10, 11, 16, 20],

[23, 30, 34, 60]

]

target = 3

m = 3, n = 4

Total elements = 12

Binary search:

left = 0, right = 11

mid = 5

matrix[1][1] = 11 > 3 → right = 4

mid = 2

matrix[0][2] = 5 > 3 → right = 1

mid = 0

matrix[0][0] = 1 < 3 → left = 1

mid = 1

matrix[0][1] = 3 == 3 → return True

Perfect.

Now, the second example:

matrix = [

[1, 3, 5, 7],

[10, 11, 16, 20],

[23, 30, 34, 60]

]

target = 13

m = 3, n = 4

Total elements = 12

Binary search:

left = 0, right = 11

mid = 5

matrix[1][1] = 11 < 13 → left = 6

mid = 6

matrix[1][2] = 16 > 13 → right = 5

mid = 5

matrix[1][1] = 11 < 13 → left = 6

mid = 6

matrix[1][2] = 16 > 13 → right = 5

Since left > right, return False

Correct, because 13 is not in the matrix.

Seems good.

Now, I need to consider edge cases.

Edge case 1: matrix with only one row.

matrix = [

[1, 2, 3, 4]

]

target = 3

Should return True

Edge case 2: matrix with only one column.

matrix = [

[1],

[2],

[3],

[4]

]

target = 3

Should return True

Edge case 3: matrix with one row and one column.

matrix = [

[1]

]

target = 1

Should return True

Edge case 4: target is less than the smallest element.

matrix = [

[1, 2, 3, 4],

[5, 6, 7, 8],

[9, 10, 11, 12]

]

target = 0

Should return False

Edge case 5: target is greater than the largest element.

matrix = [

[1, 2, 3, 4],

[5, 6, 7, 8],

[9, 10, 11, 12]

]

target = 13

Should return False

Edge case 6: target is equal to the first element.

matrix = [

[1, 2, 3, 4],

[5, 6, 7, 8],

[9, 10, 11, 12]

]

target = 1

Should return True

Edge case 7: target is equal to the last element.

matrix = [

[1, 2, 3, 4],

[5, 6, 7, 8],

[9, 10, 11, 12]

]

target = 12

Should return True

Edge case 8: matrix is empty.

matrix = []

target = 1

Should return False

Wait, but according to the constraints, m and n are at least 1, so matrix is never empty.

Edge case 9: matrix has only one row and target is not in it.

matrix = [

[1, 2, 3, 4]

]

target = 5

Should return False

Edge case 10: matrix has only one column and target is not in it.

matrix = [

[1],

[2],

[3],

[4]

]

target = 5

Should return False

I think these cover most of the edge cases.

Now, I need to implement this in Python.

I need to make sure that I handle the cases where m or n is 1.

Also, need to ensure that the indices are within bounds.

Given that m and n are at least 1, as per constraints, so no empty matrix.

Also, the elements can be from -10^4 to 10^4, so no issues with integer overflow in Python.

I should also consider that the matrix is sorted as per the given properties, so no need to check for sorted order.

I need to directly apply the binary search as planned.

Let me write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given target integer exists in a 2D matrix that has specific sorting properties: each row is sorted in non-decreasing order, and the first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row. We are required to solve this in O(log(m * n)) time complexity, which suggests using a binary search approach.

### Approach
1. **Problem Understanding:** The matrix can be visualized as a single sorted array broken into rows. For example, a matrix like `[[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]]` can be seen as `[1,3,5,7,10,11,16,20,23,30,34,60]`.
2. **Binary Search Application:** Perform a binary search on this virtual flattened array. Calculate the mid-index and map it back to the 2D matrix to check against the target.
3. **Index Mapping:** For a given mid-index, calculate the corresponding row and column in the matrix using integer division and modulo operations respectively.
4. **Decision Making:** Compare the target with the middle element:
   - If equal, return `True`.
   - If the target is less than the middle element, search the left half.
   - If the target is greater than the middle element, search the right half.
5. **Termination:** If the target is not found after the search, return `False`.

    The algorithm can be explained using three pointers: `red`, `white`, and `blue`. `red` is responsible for tracking the position where the next 0 should be moved to, starting from the beginning of the array. Likewise, `blue` is responsible for tracking the position where the next 2 should be swapped to, starting from the end of the array. `white` is responsible for iterating through the array.

While `white` is less than or equal to `blue`, check the current `nums[white]` value. If it is 0, swap it with the value at index `red`, and increment both `red` and `white`. If it is 1, simply increment `white`. If it is 2, swap the value at index `white` with the value at index `blue`, and decrement `blue` without incrementing `white` since the newly swapped value at index `white` might be 0 or 2.

This will sort the colors in the required order with a linear-time complexity, as we only go through the array once with the `white` pointer. Also, it sorts the colors in-place without the need for additional storage.

In this case, the three colors are represented by the integers 0, 1, and 2.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We will use three pointers: `low`, `mid`, and `high`.
   - `low` pointer will track the end of the section containing 0s.
   - `mid` pointer will traverse the array.
   - `high` pointer will track the start of the section containing 2s.

2. **Traversal**:
   - We will iterate through the array with the `mid` pointer.
   - If the element at `mid` is 0, we swap it with the element at `low` and increment both `low` and `mid`.
   - If the element at `mid` is 1, we leave it in place and just increment `mid`.
   - If the element at `mid` is 2, we swap it with the element at `high` and decrement `high` without incrementing `mid` because the new element at `mid` after swap might need to be processed.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop continues until `mid` is less than or equal to `high`.

This algorithm ensures that all 0s are moved to the beginning, all 1s are in the middle, and all 2s are moved to the end of the array, sorted in-place with a single pass and constant extra space.

**Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time? John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","I'm here to help you with your programming problem. Let's tackle this step by step.

So, the problem is to find the minimum window substring in string `s` that contains all the characters from string `t`, including duplicates. If no such substring exists, we should return an empty string.

First, I need to understand what a window substring is. A window substring means a contiguous sequence of characters within `s` that includes all characters from `t`.

Given that `s` and `t` can be quite long, up to 10^5 characters, I need an efficient algorithm, preferably linear time, which is O(m + n).

Let me think about the approach. One common method for this type of problem is the sliding window technique. This involves maintaining a window defined by two pointers, left and right, which we move through the string to find the desired substring.

Here's a high-level plan:

1. **Count the characters in `t`**: I need to know how many of each character I need in my window. I can use a dictionary to store the counts of each character in `t`.

2. **Expand the window**: Start with the left pointer at the beginning of `s` and move the right pointer to include more characters into the window until the window contains all characters from `t`.

3. **Shrink the window**: Once the window contains all characters from `t`, try to shrink the window from the left to find the smallest such window.

4. **Repeat steps 2 and 3**: Continue moving the right pointer to expand the window and then shrinking it from the left, keeping track of the smallest window that contains all characters from `t`.

5. **Handle duplicates**: Since `t` can have duplicate characters, I need to make sure that the window contains at least as many of each character as are present in `t`.

6. **Edge cases**: Consider cases where `s` is shorter than `t`, or `t` has characters not present in `s`, or `s` and `t` are identical.

Let me think about how to implement this in code.

First, I'll need to keep track of the counts of characters in the current window and compare them to the counts in `t`. I can use dictionaries for this purpose.

Let's define:

- `t_count`: a dictionary containing the counts of each character in `t`.

- `window_count`: a dictionary containing the counts of characters in the current window.

I need to keep track of how many unique characters from `t` are currently satisfied in the window. I can use a variable, say `formed`, to keep track of how many unique characters from `t` are met in the current window, and `required` to store how many unique characters in `t` need to be present in the window.

Here's a more detailed plan:

1. **Initialize `t_count`**: Count the occurrences of each character in `t`.

2. **Initialize variables**:

- `left` and `right` pointers for the window.

- `formed` to track how many unique characters from `t` are in the current window.

- `required` to store the number of unique characters in `t`.

- `min_length` to record the minimum window length found.

- `min_window` to store the actual substring.

3. **Expand the window**:

- Move the `right` pointer to the right, adding characters to `window_count`.

- If a character added is in `t` and its count in `window_count` matches or exceeds its count in `t_count`, increment `formed`.

4. **Shrink the window**:

- Once `formed` equals `required`, meaning the window contains all characters from `t`, try to shrink the window from the left.

- Move the `left` pointer to the right, removing characters from `window_count`.

- If a character removed is in `t` and its count in `window_count` drops below its count in `t_count`, decrement `formed`.

- Keep track of the smallest window during this process.

5. **Repeat steps 3 and 4** until the `right` pointer reaches the end of `s`.

This seems like a solid plan. Now, let's think about how to implement this in Python.

I'll need to handle cases where `t` has characters not present in `s`, or where `s` is shorter than `t`. Also, I need to make sure that the window handles duplicate characters correctly.

Let me consider an example to test my logic.

**Example 1:**

- `s = ""ADOBECODEBANC""`, `t = ""ABC""`

- The minimum window is `""BANC""`.

Let's walk through the algorithm:

- `t_count = {'A':1, 'B':1, 'C':1}`, `required = 3`

- Initialize `left = 0`, `right = 0`, `formed = 0`, `min_length = infinity`, `min_window = """"`

- Expand the window:

- `right = 0`, char = 'A', `window_count = {'A':1}`, `formed = 1` (since 'A' count matches)

- `right = 1`, char = 'D', `window_count = {'A':1, 'D':1}`, `formed = 1` (D not in t)

- `right = 2`, char = 'O', `window_count = {'A':1, 'D':1, 'O':1}`, `formed = 1` (O not in t)

- `right = 3`, char = 'B', `window_count = {'A':1, 'D':1, 'O':1, 'B':1}`, `formed = 2` (B count matches)

- `right = 4`, char = 'E', `window_count = {'A':1, 'D':1, 'O':1, 'B':1, 'E':1}`, `formed = 2` (E not in t)

- `right = 5`, char = 'C', `window_count = {'A':1, 'D':1, 'O':1, 'B':1, 'E':1, 'C':1}`, `formed = 3` (C count matches)

- Now, `formed == required`, start shrinking the window from the left.

- `left = 0`, char = 'A', if removing 'A' makes `window_count['A'] < t_count['A']`, then decrement `formed`. Here, `window_count['A'] = 1` which is equal to `t_count['A'] = 1`, so formed decreases to 2.

- New window is from `left = 1` to `right = 5`, which is ""DOBEC"", `formed = 2` (missing 'A')

- Expand the window to the right:

- `right = 6`, char = 'O', `window_count = {'D':1, 'O':2, 'B':1, 'E':1, 'C':1}`, `formed = 2` (O not in t)

- `right = 7`, char = 'D', `window_count = {'D':2, 'O':2, 'B':1, 'E':1, 'C':1}`, `formed = 2` (D not in t)

- `right = 8`, char = 'E', `window_count = {'D':2, 'O':2, 'B':1, 'E':2, 'C':1}`, `formed = 2` (E not in t)

- `right = 9`, char = 'B', `window_count = {'D':2, 'O':2, 'B':2, 'E':2, 'C':1}`, `formed = 3` (B count still matches)

- Now, `formed == required`, start shrinking again.

- `left = 1`, char = 'D', `window_count['D'] = 2`, which is more than `t_count['D'] = 0` (D not in t), so formed remains 3.

- Now, `formed < required`, so stop shrinking and move `right` forward.

- Continue this process until `right` reaches the end of `s`.

This seems correct, but it's a bit tedious to do manually. I need to make sure that my code handles all these cases correctly.

Another important aspect is to handle the counts properly, especially when characters are duplicated or not present in `t`.

Also, I need to keep track of the minimum window found so far.

Let me think about how to implement this efficiently in code.

I can use the `collections.defaultdict` for the character counts to handle missing keys gracefully.

I also need to initialize `min_length` to a large number, like `float('inf')`, and update it whenever I find a smaller window that satisfies the condition.

I need to make sure that when I shrink the window from the left, I'm correctly updating the `formed` counter based on whether the character being removed is in `t` and whether its count in the window matches the required count.

Let me try to write some pseudocode first:","from collections import defaultdict

### Approach

1. **Backtracking**: This is a classic problem that can be solved using backtracking. Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for finding all solutions by incrementally building candidates and abandoning them if they don't lead to a valid solution.

2. **Recursive Function**: We'll use a recursive function to build combinations. Starting from the first number, we'll decide whether to include each number in the combination or not, while ensuring that we don't exceed the length `k`.

3. **Pruning**: To optimize, we can prune branches that cannot lead to a valid combination. For example, if we have already chosen `m` numbers and there aren't enough remaining numbers to make up `k`, we can stop exploring that path.

**Follow up:** Could you use search pruning to make your solution faster with a larger `board`? Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The idea is to iterate through each cell in the grid, and whenever we find a cell that matches the first character of the word, we start a DFS from that cell to see if the remaining characters of the word can be formed by moving horizontally or vertically to adjacent cells without reusing the same cell more than once.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialization:**
   - We'll keep track of the dimensions of the grid, `rows` and `cols`.
   - We'll define the possible directions we can move: up, down, left, right.

2. **DFS Function:**
   - This function will take the current position `(i, j)` on the grid and the index of the current character in the word we're trying to match.
   - If the index equals the length of the word, it means we've found all characters and return `True`.
   - If the current cell is out of bounds, doesn't match the current character, or has already been visited in this path, return `False`.
   - Mark the current cell as visited for this path.
   - Recursively search in all four directions.
   - If any of the recursive calls return `True`, return `True`.
   - Backtrack by marking the current cell as unvisited.

3. **Main Function:**
   - Iterate through each cell in the grid.
   - If a cell matches the first character of the word, start DFS from that cell.
   - If DFS returns `True`, return `True`.
   - If no starting cell leads to the full word, return `False`.

This approach ensures that we explore all possible paths from each cell that matches the starting character of the word, and by using backtracking, we avoid reusing the same cell multiple times in a single path.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given word exists in a 2D grid of characters. The word can be formed by sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacency is defined as horizontal or vertical neighbors, and the same cell cannot be used more than once in a single word.

### Approach
1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a 2D grid of characters and a target word.
   - We need to check if the word exists in the grid by moving only to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).

2. **Intuition**:
   - We can use a depth-first search (DFS) to explore possible paths in the grid that match the target word.
   - Start DFS from each cell that matches the first character of the word.
   - Ensure that we do not reuse the same cell in a single path by keeping track of visited cells.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Define possible movement directions: up, down, left, right.
   - Implement a DFS function that takes the current position and the current index in the word.
   - If the current index equals the length of the word, the word has been found.
   - Check boundaries and ensure the current cell matches the required character and hasn't been visited yet.
   - Mark the cell as visited, recurse in all four directions, and backtrack if the path doesn't lead to the word.

4. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - Time Complexity: O(N*(3^L)) where N is the number of cells in the grid and L is the length of the word. Each cell can be the start of a path, and from each cell, we can explore up to three directions (since we cannot go back to the cell we came from).
   - Space Complexity: O(L) where L is the length of the word. This is the maximum depth of the recursion stack.

So, the task is to remove duplicates from a sorted array such that each unique element appears at most twice.

Given that the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, we can take advantage of that to efficiently solve the problem.

Let's think about how we can approach this.

First, since the array is sorted, duplicates will be adjacent to each other. So, we can iterate through the array and keep track of the number of times each element appears.

We need to ensure that each unique element appears at most twice. That means if an element appears more than twice, we need to remove the extra occurrences.

But since we can't actually change the length of the array in some languages, we need to rearrange the elements in such a way that the first k elements of the array hold the final result, where k is the number of elements after removing the duplicates.

So, one way to think about it is to have a pointer or an index that keeps track of the position where the next unique element (or its second occurrence) should be placed.

Let me try to outline a step-by-step plan:

1. Initialize a variable, say `count`, to keep track of the number of times the current element has appeared. We can start with 0.

2. Initialize another variable, say `k`, which will represent the length of the array after removing duplicates. This will also serve as the position where the next unique element should be placed.

3. Iterate through the array with a loop, starting from the first element.

4. For each element, check if it is the same as the element at position `k-2`. Since the array is sorted, if the current element is the same as the element two positions before `k` in the modified array, it means it's the third occurrence of that element, and we should skip it.

5. If it's not the same, or if it's the first or second occurrence, we can place it at position `k` in the array and increment `k`.

6. Continue this process until we've iterate through the entire array.

7. Finally, return `k`, which is the new length of the array after removing duplicates.

Let me try to illustrate this with the first example:

nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]

- Initialize count = 0, k = 0

- Iterate through the array:

- i=0, nums[0]=1

- Since k < 2, place nums[0] at nums[k=0], k=1

- i=1, nums[1]=1

- Check if nums[1] == nums[k-2]=nums[-2] (which is undefined, so it's fine), place nums[1] at nums[k=1], k=2

- i=2, nums[2]=1

- Check if nums[2] == nums[k-2]=nums[0]=1, which is true, so skip

- i=3, nums[3]=2

- nums[3]!= nums[k-2]=nums[0]=1, place nums[3] at nums[k=2], k=3

- i=4, nums[4]=2

- Check if nums[4] == nums[k-2]=nums[1]=1, which is false, place nums[4] at nums[k=3], k=4

- i=5, nums[5]=3

- Check if nums[5] == nums[k-2]=nums[2]=2, which is false, place nums[5] at nums[k=4], k=5

- End of array, return k=5, and nums=[1,1,2,2,3, _]

This seems correct.

Let's consider the second example:

nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]

- Initialize count = 0, k = 0

- Iterate through the array:

- i=0, nums[0]=0

- k < 2, place nums[0] at nums[k=0], k=1

- i=1, nums[1]=0

- Check if nums[1] == nums[k-2]=nums[-1] (undefined), place nums[1] at nums[k=1], k=2

- i=2, nums[2]=1

- Check if nums[2] == nums[k-2]=nums[0]=0, which is false, place nums[2] at nums[k=2], k=3

- i=3, nums[3]=1

- Check if nums[3] == nums[k-2]=nums[1]=0, which is false, place nums[3] at nums[k=3], k=4

- i=4, nums[4]=1

- Check if nums[4] == nums[k-2]=nums[2]=1, which is true, skip

- i=5, nums[5]=1

- Check if nums[5] == nums[k-2]=nums[2]=1, which is true, skip

- i=6, nums[6]=2

- Check if nums[6] == nums[k-2]=nums[2]=1, which is false, place nums[6] at nums[k=4], k=5

- i=7, nums[7]=3

- Check if nums[7] == nums[k-2]=nums[3]=1, which is false, place nums[7] at nums[k=5], k=6

- i=8, nums[8]=3

- Check if nums[8] == nums[k-2]=nums[4]=2, which is false, place nums[8] at nums[k=6], k=7

- End of array, return k=7, and nums=[0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_]

Perfect, that matches the expected output.

Now, let's think about edge cases:

1. If the array has less than or equal to 2 elements, we don't need to remove any duplicates. The entire array should be kept as is.

2. If all elements are the same, and there are more than two, we should keep only two of them.

3. If there are unique elements with no duplicates, the array should remain the same.

4. If the array has a mix of elements with some appearing twice, and others appearing more than twice, we need to ensure that only up to two occurrences of any element are kept.

Let's consider some test cases:

- nums = [1]: Should return 1, nums = [1, _, _,...]

- nums = [1,1]: Should return 2, nums = [1,1, _, _,...]

- nums = [1,1,1]: Should return 2, nums = [1,1, _, _,...]

- nums = [1,2,2,2,3]: Should return 4, nums = [1,2,2,3, _]

- nums = [1,1,1,1,1]: Should return 2, nums = [1,1, _, _,...]

- nums = [1,2,3,4,5]: Should return 5, nums = [1,2,3,4,5]

- nums = [1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3]: Should return 6, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,3, _, _, _]

Seems straightforward.

Now, let's think about the implementation in code.

We need to modify the array in-place, which in Python, means we need to manipulate the list directly without creating a new one.

One way to do this is to use a pointer `k` to track the position where the next valid element should be placed.

We can iterate through the array with a loop, and for each element, check if it should be kept or not based on whether it's the third duplicate.

But in the step-by-step plan I outlined earlier, I suggested checking if the current element is the same as `nums[k-2]`. This works because if it is, then it's the third duplicate.

Wait, but in Python, negative indices wrap around, so `nums[-1]` would refer to the last element, which is not what we want. To avoid this, we can add a condition to check if `k < 2`, in which case we can always place the element.

So, here's a more precise plan:

- Initialize k = 0

- Iterate through each element in nums:

- If k < 2 or nums[i]!= nums[k-2], then:

- Set nums[k] = nums[i]

- Increment k

- Return k

This should work because:

- For the first two elements (k < 2), they are always kept.

- For elements beyond the second, they are kept only if they are not equal to nums[k-2].

This effectively ensures that no element appears more than twice.

Let me verify this with the first example again:

nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]

- k = 0

- i=0, k=0 < 2, set nums[0]=1, k=1

- i=1, k=1 < 2, set nums[1]=1, k=2

- i=2, k=2 >=2, check nums[2]=1 == nums[k-2]=nums[0]=1, which is true, so skip

- i=3, nums[3]=2!= nums[k-2]=nums[0]=1, set nums[2]=2, k=3

- i=4, nums[4]=2 == nums[k-2]=nums[1]=1, wait, nums[1]=1? Wait, k=3, so k-2=1, nums[1]=1, nums[4]=2!=1, so set nums[3]=2, k=4

- i=5, nums[5]=3!= nums[k-2]=nums[2]=2, set nums[4]=3, k=5

- Return k=5

Yes, that matches the earlier result.

Another test case: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]

- k=0

- i=0, k=0 <2, set nums[0]=0, k=1

- i=1, k=1 <2, set nums[1]=0, k=2

- i=2, k=2 >=2, check nums[2]=1!= nums[k-2]=nums[0]=0, set nums[2]=1, k=3

- i=3, nums[3]=1 == nums[k-2]=nums[1]=0, set nums[3]=1, k=4

- i=4, nums[4]=1 == nums[k-2]=nums[2]=1, skip

- i=5, nums[5]=1 == nums[k-2]=nums[2]=1, skip

- i=6, nums[6]=2!= nums[k-2]=nums[2]=1, set nums[4]=2, k=5

- i=7, nums[7]=3!= nums[k-2]=nums[3]=1, set nums[5]=3, k=6

- i=8, nums[8]=3 == nums[k-2]=nums[4]=2, so set nums[6]=3, k=7

- Return k=7

Wait, but according to earlier reasoning, at i=8, nums[8]=3 == nums[k-2]=nums[4]=2, which is false, so it should be placed. Wait, nums[k-2]=nums[5]=3, actually.

Wait, k=6, k-2=4, nums[4]=2, nums[8]=3!=2, so set nums[6]=3, k=7

Yes, that's correct.

Another edge case: nums = [1,1,1,1]

- k=0

- i=0, k=0 <2, set nums[0]=1, k=1

- i=1, k=1 <2, set nums[1]=1, k=2

- i=2, k=2 >=2, check nums[2]=1 == nums[k-2]=nums[0]=1, skip

- i=3, nums[3]=1 == nums[k-2]=nums[0]=1, skip

- Return k=2, nums=[1,1,_,_]

Correct.

Another edge case: nums = [1,1,2]

- k=0

- i=0, k=0 <2, set nums[0]=1, k=1

- i=1, k=1 <2, set nums[1]=1, k=2

- i=2, k=2 >=2, check nums[2]=2!= nums[k-2]=nums[0]=1, set nums[2]=2, k=3

- Return k=3, nums=[1,1,2]

Correct.

Seems like this approach works for these cases.

Now, let's think about the time and space complexity.

Time complexity: We're iterating through the array once, so O(n), where n is the length of the array.

Space complexity: We're using only a constant amount of extra space, so O(1), which satisfies the problem's requirement.

I think this is a solid solution.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to modify a sorted integer array in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. The relative order of the elements should be maintained, and we must achieve this with O(1) extra memory.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**: Use a pointer `k` to track the position where the next valid element should be placed.
2. **Iteration**: Traverse the array with an index `i`. For each element:
   - If `k < 2` or the current element `nums[i]` is not equal to the element two places before the current pointer position (`nums[k - 2]`), place `nums[i]` at `nums[k]` and increment `k`.
3. **Result**: The first `k` elements of the array will hold the result.

This approach ensures that we are not using extra space beyond a few variables, adhering to the O(1) space constraint.

    The algorithm is based on a modified binary search. We start by setting two pointers named `left` and `right` at the first and last element of the array, respectively. We then enter a loop, which continues until the `left` pointer is less than or equal to the `right` pointer.

Inside the loop, we first calculate the middle index `mid` using the `left` and `right` pointers. If the middle element of the array is equal to the target, we return true, indicating that the target is found.

If the middle element is equal to the left element, we increment the `left` pointer. If the middle element is greater than the left element, we check if the target is within the left and middle elements. If it is, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one. Otherwise, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one.

If the middle element is still smaller than the left element, we then check if the target is within the middle and right elements. If it is, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one. Otherwise, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one.

The array is sorted in non-decreasing order and then rotated at some pivot unknown to us.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The array is sorted and rotated, which means there are two sorted subarrays.
   - Duplicates can make it challenging to determine which part of the array is sorted.

2. **Initial Thoughts:**
   - We can use a modified binary search to handle the rotated sorted array.
   - The presence of duplicates requires additional handling to ensure we don't miss the target.

3. **Key Insights:**
   - In a standard binary search on a sorted array, we compare the middle element with the target and decide which half to search next.
   - In a rotated sorted array, one half will always be sorted, and we can use this property to adjust our search.

4. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - Duplicates can make it impossible to determine which side is sorted just by comparing the start and end elements.
   - We need to handle cases where the start, middle, and end elements are equal.

5. **Algorithm Steps:**
   - Use binary search with adjustments for the rotated array.
   - Check if the middle element is equal to the target; if so, return True.
   - If the start element is equal to the middle element and the middle element is equal to the end element, move the start and end pointers to skip duplicates.
   - Determine which half is sorted:
     - If the left half is sorted, check if the target is within the left half's range.
     - If the right half is sorted, check if the target is within the right half's range.
   - Adjust the search range accordingly.

So, the task is to delete all nodes in a sorted linked list that have duplicate numbers, keeping only the distinct numbers, and return the sorted list.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. Given a linked list that is already sorted in ascending order, I have to traverse through it and remove any nodes that have values that appear more than once in the list. The resulting list should only contain nodes with unique values, and it should remain sorted.

Let me consider the examples provided to get a better grasp:

**Example 1:**

- Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5

- Output: 1 -> 2 -> 5

Here, the numbers 3 and 4 are duplicates, so they are removed.

**Example 2:**

- Input: 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3

- Output: 2 -> 3

In this case, all 1's are duplicates, so only 2 and 3 remain.

From these examples, it seems that I need to identify sequences of identical values and remove the entire sequence if there is more than one occurrence of that value.

I should also consider edge cases:

- An empty list: Should return an empty list.

- A list with only one node: Should return the same list since there are no duplicates.

- A list where all nodes are duplicates: Should return an empty list.

- A list with multiple groups of duplicates and unique nodes in between.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in code. Since the list is sorted, duplicates will be adjacent to each other. I can traverse the list and check if the current node's value is the same as the next node's value. If they are the same, I need to skip all nodes with that value until I reach a different value.

However, I need to be careful with the pointers, especially when dealing with the head of the list and when removing nodes.

One approach is to use a dummy node that points to the head of the list. This way, I can handle the head similarly to other nodes.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Create a dummy node that points to the head. This will help in handling the case where the head needs to be removed.

2. Initialize two pointers: `prev` and `curr`. Start with `prev` pointing to the dummy node and `curr` pointing to the head.

3. Traverse the list with `curr`:

   a. While `curr` and `curr.next` are not None, and `curr.val` == `curr.next.val`, it means there are duplicates.

   b. In this case, note the value to remove and skip all nodes with that value.

   c. Set `curr` to the next node after the duplicates.

   d. Set `prev.next` to `curr`, effectively removing the duplicates.

   e. If there are no duplicates, move `prev` and `curr` forward.

4. Continue this process until `curr` is None.

5. Return the dummy node's next, which is the new head of the list.

Let me try to visualize this with Example 1:

- Dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5

- Initialize: prev = Dummy, curr = 1

- Check curr (1) and curr.next (2): values are different, move prev and curr forward.

- prev = 1, curr = 2

- Check curr (2) and curr.next (3): different, move forward.

- prev = 2, curr = 3

- Check curr (3) and curr.next (3): same, skip all 3's.

- Set curr to the node after the last 3, which is 4.

- Set prev.next = curr, so 2.next = 4.

- Now, list is Dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5

- Continue from curr = 4

- Check curr (4) and curr.next (4): same, skip all 4's.

- Set curr to the node after the last 4, which is 5.

- Set prev.next = curr, so 2.next = 5.

- Now, list is Dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 5

- Continue from curr = 5

- Check curr (5) and curr.next (None): stop.

- Return Dummy.next, which is 1 -> 2 -> 5

This seems correct.

Let's consider Example 2:

- Dummy -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3

- Initialize: prev = Dummy, curr = 1

- Check curr (1) and curr.next (1): same, skip all 1's.

- Set curr to the node after the last 1, which is 2.

- Set prev.next = curr, so Dummy.next = 2.

- Now, list is Dummy -> 2 -> 3

- Continue from curr = 2

- Check curr (2) and curr.next (3): different, move forward.

- prev = 2, curr = 3

- Check curr (3) and curr.next (None): stop.

- Return Dummy.next, which is 2 -> 3

Good.

Now, consider a list with all duplicates:

- Dummy -> 1 -> 1 -> 1

- Initialize: prev = Dummy, curr = 1

- Check curr (1) and curr.next (1): same, skip all 1's.

- Set curr to the node after the last 1, which is None.

- Set prev.next = curr, so Dummy.next = None

- Return Dummy.next, which is None

Correct.

Another case: single node

- Dummy -> 1

- Initialize: prev = Dummy, curr = 1

- Check curr (1) and curr.next (None): stop.

- Return Dummy.next, which is 1

Correct.

Edge case: empty list

- Dummy -> None

- Initialize: prev = Dummy, curr = None

- Stop immediately.

- Return Dummy.next, which is None

Correct.

Seems like this approach handles all cases.

    The algorithm to delete all duplicates in a sorted linked list simply iterates through the list and compares the value of the current node with the value of the next. If both values are the same, it means that there is a duplicate, so the current node's ""next"" pointer is updated to point to the node after the duplicate. If the values are different, the algorithm continues iterating to the next node. The process continues until reaching the end of the list. Since the linked list is already sorted, this algorithm guarantees that duplicates will appear consecutively, allowing for their removal in linear time.

So, you have a sorted linked list, and you need to delete all duplicates so that each element appears only once. The list should remain sorted after the operation. You've provided some examples and constraints as well.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. Given a sorted linked list, I need to traverse through it and remove any nodes that have the same value as the previous node, effectively keeping only unique values in the list.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since the list is sorted, duplicates will be adjacent to each other. So, I can traverse the list and compare each node's value with the next node's value. If they are the same, I need to skip the next node by adjusting the pointers.

I should also consider edge cases, such as an empty list, a list with only one node, or a list where all nodes are duplicates.

Let me outline the steps I need to take:

1. Check if the list is empty or has only one node. If so, return the list as is because there are no duplicates to remove.

2. Initialize a pointer to the head of the list.

3. Traverse the list, and for each node, check if its value is equal to the next node's value.

4. If they are equal, skip the next node by pointing the current node's next pointer to the node after the next one.

5. If they are not equal, move to the next node.

6. Continue this process until the end of the list is reached.

7. Return the head of the modified list.

I need to make sure that I handle the pointers correctly to avoid losing any part of the list or creating cycles.

Let me consider the first example:

Input: head = [1,1,2]

Expected Output: [1,2]

So, starting with head pointing to the first 1.

- Current node: 1, next node: 1 (duplicate), so skip the next node and point to 2.

- Now, current node: 1, next node: 2 (not duplicate), move to next node.

- Current node: 2, next node: None, end of list.

Result: [1,2]

Seems correct.

Another example:

Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]

Expected Output: [1,2,3]

Traverse the list:

- Current node: 1, next node: 1 (duplicate), skip to 2.

- Current node: 1, next node: 2 (not duplicate), move to next node.

- Current node: 2, next node: 3 (not duplicate), move to next node.

- Current node: 3, next node: 3 (duplicate), skip to None.

- End of list.

Result: [1,2,3]

Good.

Now, edge cases:

- Empty list: []

- Should return []

- Single node: [1]

- Should return [1]

- All duplicates: [1,1,1,1]

- Should return [1]

- No duplicates: [1,2,3,4]

- Should return [1,2,3,4]

I need to ensure that my function handles these cases correctly.

Let me think about the implementation in code.

I assume that there is a ListNode class defined, with a val attribute and a next attribute pointing to the next node.

I need to write a function, say, deleteDuplicates, that takes the head of the list and returns the head of the modified list.

I'll use a while loop to traverse the list. I'll keep a reference to the current node and check its next node.

If the current node's value is equal to its next node's value, I'll set current.next = current.next.next, effectively skipping the next node.

If they are not equal, I'll move to the next node: current = current.next

I need to be careful not to lose the reference to the next node when skipping, but since I'm adjusting the pointers, it should be fine.

Let me write a draft of the code in my mind:

def deleteDuplicates(head):

if not head or not head.next:

return head

current = head

while current and current.next:

if current.val == current.next.val:

current.next = current.next.next

else:

current = current.next

return head

Wait a minute, is this correct?

Let me test it with the first example:

head = 1 -> 1 -> 2

current starts at 1.

current.val == current.next.val (1 == 1), so set current.next = current.next.next, which is 2.

Now, current still points to 1, and current.next is 2.

Now, current.val!= current.next.val (1!= 2), so move to current = current.next, which is 2.

Now, current.next is None, so end of loop.

Return head, which is 1 -> 2.

Correct.

Second example:

head = 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3

current starts at 1.

current.val == current.next.val (1 == 1), set current.next = 2.

Now, current still points to 1, current.next is 2.

1!= 2, so move to current = 2.

current.val!= current.next.val (2!= 3), move to current = 3.

current.val == current.next.val (3 == 3), set current.next = current.next.next, which is None.

Now, current.next is None, so end of loop.

Return head: 1 -> 2 -> 3.

Correct.

Edge cases:

- Empty list: head = None

- Function returns None, which is correct.

- Single node: head = 1

- No duplicates, return 1.

- All duplicates: head = 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1

- Should return 1.

Wait, according to the problem statement, each element should appear only once.

So, in the case of all duplicates, it should keep one instance.

But in my draft code, it would keep the first 1 and remove the rest, which is correct.

- No duplicates: head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

- Should remain as is.

Seems fine.

But wait, in the all duplicates case, does my code handle it correctly?

Let's see:

head = 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1

current starts at 1.

current.val == current.next.val (1 == 1), set current.next = 1 ->1

Now, current.next is the second 1.

current.val == current.next.val (1 == 1), set current.next = third 1.

Repeat until current.next is None.

Wait, no.

In my draft code, once current.val == current.next.val, I set current.next = current.next.next, and stay at the current node.

So, in this case:

- initial: 1 -> 1 ->1 ->1

- current at first 1, set current.next to third 1.

- Now, current.next is third 1.

- current.val == current.next.val (1 ==1), set current.next to fourth 1.

- Now, current.next is fourth 1.

- current.val == current.next.val (1 ==1), set current.next to None.

- Now, current.next is None, so end of loop.

- Return head: 1 -> None

- Which is correct, only one 1 remains.

Good.

But in my initial thought, I thought it would keep the first 1 and remove the rest, which is correct.

I think my draft code is correct.

But I need to make sure that I don't skip more than necessary.

Wait, in the first example, head = 1 ->1 ->2

- current at 1, set current.next to 2.

- Then, current.val!= current.next.val, move to current =2.

- End.

Only one 1 remains.

Similarly, in head = 1 ->1 ->1 ->1

- current at 1, set current.next to third 1.

- current.val == current.next.val, set current.next to fourth 1.

- current.val == current.next.val, set current.next to None.

- End.

Only one 1 remains.

Seems correct.

I think this approach is correct.

I should implement this in code.

But before that, I need to make sure that I handle the case where the list has two nodes that are duplicates.

For example, head = 1 ->1

Should return 1 ->None

According to my code:

- current at 1, current.next is 1.

- current.val == current.next.val, set current.next = None.

- End.

Correct.

Another case: head = 1 ->2

- current at 1, current.next is 2.

- current.val!= current.next.val, move to current =2.

- current.next is None.

- End.

Return 1 ->2.

Correct.

I think my approach is solid.

I can proceed to implement this in code.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to delete all duplicates from a sorted linked list such that each element appears only once. The list should remain sorted after the operation.

### Approach
1. **Check for Empty List or Single Node:** If the list is empty or contains only one node, return the list as is because there are no duplicates to remove.
2. ** Traverse the List:** Use a pointer to traverse the list. For each node, check if its value is equal to the value of the next node.
3. **Skip Duplicates:** If the current node's value is equal to the next node's value, skip the next node by adjusting the pointer to the node after next.
4. **Move to the Next Node:** If the current node's value is not equal to the next node's value, move to the next node.
5. **Repeat Until End:** Continue this process until the end of the list is reached.

First, I need to understand the problem fully. Given an array of integers representing the heights of the bars in the histogram, I need to find the largest rectangular area that can be formed within the histogram.

Let me look at the examples provided.

In the first example:

heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]

The largest rectangle is explained to have an area of 10 units. Looking at the heights, I can visualize the histogram:

- Bar 0: height 2

- Bar 1: height 1

- Bar 2: height 5

- Bar 3: height 6

- Bar 4: height 2

- Bar 5: height 3

So, the rectangle with area 10 must be formed by multiple bars. Maybe bars 2 and 3, which have heights 5 and 6 respectively. But 5*2 = 10, which matches.

In the second example:

heights = [2,4]

The largest rectangle is 4, which would be either the first bar with height 2 and width 1, or the second bar with height 4 and width 1. So, the largest is 4.

Wait, but if I take both bars, the height would be limited by the smaller one, which is 2, and width 2, giving area 4. So, that works too.

So, the naive approach would be to consider every possible subarray of bars and calculate the area of the rectangle formed by them, then find the maximum area.

But that would be O(n^2), which might not be efficient enough given the constraints: heights.length can be up to 10^5.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me think about this differently. For each bar, what is the maximum width of rectangle that can be formed with that bar's height?

If I can find, for each bar, the farthest left and right bars that are not shorter than it, then the width of the rectangle for that bar would be (right - left - 1), and the area would be height * width.

Then, I can iterate through all bars, calculate their maximum possible rectangle areas, and take the maximum.

This seems promising.

So, I need to find, for each bar, the nearest shorter bar to the left and the nearest shorter bar to the right.

Once I have those, the width would be (right_index - left_index - 1), and the area would be height * width.

This way, I can reduce the complexity.

To find the nearest shorter bar to the left for each bar, I can use a stack.

Similarly, for the nearest shorter bar to the right.

This is a common pattern in histogram problems.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Create two arrays: left and right.

- left[i] will store the index of the nearest bar to the left of bar i that is shorter than bar i.

- right[i] will store the index of the nearest bar to the right of bar i that is shorter than bar i.

2. Initialize left and right arrays with -1 and len(heights), respectively, as default values.

3. Use a stack to compute left indices:

- Iterate from left to right.

- For each bar, while the stack is not empty and the top bar's height is greater than or equal to the current bar's height, pop the stack.

- If the stack is not empty after this, the top bar's index is the nearest shorter bar to the left.

- Push the current bar's index onto the stack.

4. Use another stack to compute right indices:

- Iterate from right to left.

- For each bar, while the stack is not empty and the top bar's height is greater than or equal to the current bar's height, pop the stack.

- If the stack is not empty after this, the top bar's index is the nearest shorter bar to the right.

- Push the current bar's index onto the stack.

5. For each bar, calculate width as right[i] - left[i] - 1.

6. Calculate area as height[i] * width.

7. Find the maximum area among all bars.

This should give me the largest rectangle area in the histogram.

Let me try to apply this to the first example:

heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]

First, initialize left and right arrays:

left = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

right = [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

(Note: assuming len(heights) = 6, so right initializes to 6.)

Compute left indices:

Initialize stack: []

For i=0 (height=2):

- Stack is empty, left[0] = -1

- Push 0 onto stack

Stack: [0]

For i=1 (height=1):

- Stack: [0]

- heights[0]=2 >= heights[1]=1, pop 0

- Stack empty, left[1] = -1

- Push 1 onto stack

Stack: [1]

For i=2 (height=5):

- Stack: [1]

- heights[1]=1 < heights[2]=5, left[2] = 1

- Push 2 onto stack

Stack: [1,2]

For i=3 (height=6):

- Stack: [1,2]

- heights[2]=5 < heights[3]=6, left[3] = 2

- Push 3 onto stack

Stack: [1,2,3]

For i=4 (height=2):

- Stack: [1,2,3]

- heights[3]=6 >= heights[4]=2, pop 3

- heights[2]=5 >= heights[4]=2, pop 2

- heights[1]=1 < heights[4]=2, left[4] = 1

- Push 4 onto stack

Stack: [1,4]

For i=5 (height=3):

- Stack: [1,4]

- heights[4]=2 < heights[5]=3, left[5] = 4

- Push 5 onto stack

Stack: [1,4,5]

So, left = [-1, -1, 1, 2, 1, 4]

Now, compute right indices:

Initialize stack: []

For i=5 (height=3):

- Stack is empty, right[5] = 6

- Push 5 onto stack

Stack: [5]

For i=4 (height=2):

- Stack: [5]

- heights[5]=3 >= heights[4]=2, pop 5

- Stack empty, right[4] = 6

- Push 4 onto stack

Stack: [4]

For i=3 (height=6):

- Stack: [4]

- heights[4]=2 < heights[3]=6, right[3] = 4

- Push 3 onto stack

Stack: [4,3]

For i=2 (height=5):

- Stack: [4,3]

- heights[3]=6 >= heights[2]=5, pop 3

- heights[4]=2 < heights[2]=5, right[2] = 4

- Push 2 onto stack

Stack: [4,2]

For i=1 (height=1):

- Stack: [4,2]

- heights[2]=5 >= heights[1]=1, pop 2

- heights[4]=2 >= heights[1]=1, pop 4

- Stack empty, right[1] = 6

- Push 1 onto stack

Stack: [1]

For i=0 (height=2):

- Stack: [1]

- heights[1]=1 < heights[0]=2, right[0] = 1

- Push 0 onto stack

Stack: [1,0]

So, right = [1, 6, 4, 4, 6, 6]

Now, calculate width for each bar:

width[i] = right[i] - left[i] - 1

width[0] = 1 - (-1) - 1 = 1

area[0] = 2 * 1 = 2

width[1] = 6 - (-1) - 1 = 6

area[1] = 1 * 6 = 6

width[2] = 4 - 1 - 1 = 2

area[2] = 5 * 2 = 10

width[3] = 4 - 2 - 1 = 1

area[3] = 6 * 1 = 6

width[4] = 6 - 1 - 1 = 4

area[4] = 2 * 4 = 8

width[5] = 6 - 4 - 1 = 1

area[5] = 3 * 1 = 3

So, the maximum area is 10, which matches the first example.

Looks good.

Now, for the second example:

heights = [2,4]

Compute left indices:

Initialize stack: []

For i=0 (height=2):

- Stack empty, left[0] = -1

- Push 0 onto stack

Stack: [0]

For i=1 (height=4):

- Stack: [0]

- heights[0]=2 < heights[1]=4, left[1] = 0

- Push 1 onto stack

Stack: [0,1]

left = [-1,0]

Compute right indices:

Initialize stack: []

For i=1 (height=4):

- Stack empty, right[1] = 2

- Push 1 onto stack

Stack: [1]

For i=0 (height=2):

- Stack: [1]

- heights[1]=4 >= heights[0]=2, pop 1

- Stack empty, right[0] = 2

- Push 0 onto stack

Stack: [0]

right = [2,2]

Calculate width:

width[0] = 2 - (-1) - 1 = 2

area[0] = 2 * 2 = 4

width[1] = 2 - 0 - 1 = 1

area[1] = 4 * 1 = 4

So, the maximum area is 4, which matches the second example.

Great.

Now, I need to implement this in Python.

I need to handle edge cases, such as:

- All bars have the same height.

- For example, heights = [3,3,3,3]

- The largest rectangle should be 3 * 4 = 12

- Single bar:

- heights = [5]

- Area should be 5 * 1 = 5

- All bars decreasing:

- heights = [5,4,3,2,1]

- The largest rectangle should be 5*1, 4*2, 3*3, 2*4, 1*5 → maximum is 6 (from 3*3 or 2*4)

- All bars increasing:

- heights = [1,2,3,4,5]

- The largest rectangle should be 1*5, 2*4, 3*3, 4*2, 5*1 → maximum is 6 (from 2*4 or 3*3)

I need to make sure my code handles these cases correctly.

Also, considering the constraints:

- 1 <= heights.length <= 10^5

- 0 <= heights[i] <= 10^4

So, I need an efficient solution, preferably O(n) time and O(n) space.

The approach I outlined should be O(n), as each bar is processed a constant number of times.

Now, let's proceed to implement this in Python.

I need to be careful with the stack operations to avoid index errors.

Also, I need to handle the case where the stack is empty appropriately.

Let me write the code step by step.

First, initialize left and right arrays with appropriate sizes.

Then, implement the logic to fill the left array using a stack.

Similarly, fill the right array using another stack, iterating from right to left.

Then, calculate the widths and areas, and find the maximum area.

I should also consider that the heights can be zero, but according to the constraints, heights[i] >= 0.

Wait, no: 0 <= heights[i] <= 10^4, so heights can be zero.

I need to make sure that zero heights are handled correctly.

If a bar has height zero, then its rectangle area is zero, so it doesn't contribute to the maximum area.

But, bars with height zero can affect the left and right indices for other bars.

Wait, if a bar has height zero, then it is shorter than any positive height bar.

So, in that case, for bars to its left and right, it would act as a barrier for extending the rectangle width.

Therefore, in the left array, for bars after a zero height bar, the left index would be the zero height bar's index.

Similarly, in the right array, for bars before a zero height bar, the right index would be the zero height bar's index.

This would limit the width of rectangles that include zero height bars.

But since the area would be zero for zero height bars, we can safely ignore them in the calculation.

Wait, no. If a bar has height zero, its area is zero, but it affects the areas of other bars.

For example:

heights = [1,0,1]

For the first bar (height=1), nearest shorter to the left is -1, to the right is 1 (zero height bar).

So, width = 1 - (-1) - 1 = 1

Area = 1 * 1 = 1

For the second bar (height=0), nearest shorter to the left is -1, to the right is 3 (end).

Width = 3 - (-1) - 1 = 3

Area = 0 * 3 = 0

For the third bar (height=1), nearest shorter to the left is 1 (zero height bar), to the right is 3.

Width = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1

Area = 1 * 1 = 1

So, the maximum area is 1.

This makes sense, as the zero height bar breaks the possible larger rectangle.

Another example:

heights = [0,2,0]

For the first bar (0), area is 0

For the second bar (2), left is 0 (height=0 < 2), right is 2 (end)

Width = 2 - 0 - 1 = 1

Area = 2 * 1 = 2

For the third bar (0), area is 0

So, maximum area is 2, which is correct.

Looks like the approach handles zero heights properly.

Now, I need to implement this in code.

I need to make sure that the stack operations are correct and that I don't have off-by-one errors in calculating widths.

Also, since n can be up to 10^5, I need to make sure the code is optimized and doesn't have any unnecessary operations inside loops.

Let me proceed to write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the largest rectangle area in a histogram given the heights of the bars. Each bar has a width of 1. This problem can be efficiently solved using a stack to keep track of the bars and calculate the maximum area.

### Approach

1. **Nearest Smaller Elements:** 
   - For each bar, we need to find the nearest smaller bar to the left and the nearest smaller bar to the right.
   - These nearest smaller bars help determine the extent to which a rectangle can be extended.

2. **Using Stacks:**
   - We use stacks to keep track of bars that are increasing in height to the left and to the right.
   - For each bar, calculate the width it can cover in the rectangle and then compute the area.

3. **Steps:**
   - Compute the nearest smaller bar to the left for each bar.
   - Compute the nearest smaller bar to the right for each bar.
   - Calculate the width for each bar based on these left and right indices.
   - Compute the area for each possible rectangle and find the maximum area.

This is done for all the rows of the matrix, and finally, the maxArea is returned.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We will iterate through each row of the matrix.
   - For each row, we will compute the height of consecutive '1's ending at that row for each column.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - We will maintain an array `heights` where `heights[j]` represents the height of consecutive '1's ending at row `i` and column `j`.
   - For each cell in the matrix:
     - If `matrix[i][j] == '1'`, then `heights[j] += 1`.
     - If `matrix[i][j] == '0'`, then `heights[j] = 0` because the sequence of '1's is broken.

3. **Largest Rectangle in Histogram**:
   - For each row, treat the `heights` array as a histogram where the width of each bar is 1.
   - Compute the maximum area of a rectangle in this histogram.
   - Keep track of the maximum area found across all rows.

I need to make sure that all nodes with values less than x come before nodes with values greater than or equal to x, while keeping the original order within each partition.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. Given a linked list and a value x, I have to rearrange the list so that all nodes with values less than x are before those with values greater than or equal to x. Importantly, the relative order within each partition should remain the same as in the original list.

For example, if the list is 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 2 and x is 3, the output should be 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5. Here, 1 and 2s are less than 3, so they come first, and then 4, 3, and 5, which are greater than or equal to 3.

Another example is 2 -> 1 with x = 2, which should become 1 -> 2.

I need to consider the constraints:

- The list can have 0 to 200 nodes.

- Node values range from -100 to 100.

- x can be from -200 to 200.

So, I need to handle empty lists, lists with single nodes, and larger lists.

I should think about how to approach this. One way is to create two separate lists: one for nodes with values less than x and another for nodes with values greater than or equal to x. Then, I can concatenate these two lists, with the ""less than"" list first and the ""greater than or equal"" list second.

I need to maintain the original order within each partition, so as I traverse the original list, I should append nodes to the respective partitions without changing their order.

Let me sketch a plan:

1. Create two dummy nodes: one for the ""less than"" partition and one for the ""greater than or equal"" partition.

2. Traverse the original list, and for each node:

a. If its value is less than x, append it to the ""less than"" partition.

b. If its value is greater than or equal to x, append it to the ""greater than or equal"" partition.

3. After traversing the entire list, connect the end of the ""less than"" partition to the start of the ""greater than or equal"" partition.

4. The head of the new list will be the next node of the ""less than"" dummy node.

5. Make sure to set the next pointer of the last node in the ""greater than or equal"" partition to None to terminate the list.

I need to be careful with the pointers to avoid breaking the list or creating cycles.

Let me consider some edge cases:

- If the original list is empty, the result should be empty.

- If all nodes are less than x, the result should be the same as the original list.

- If all nodes are greater than or equal to x, the result should be the same as the original list.

- If the list has only one node, it should be returned as is.

- If the list needs to be completely reversed in terms of order, make sure the partitions are correctly formed.

I should also consider negative values and how they compare to x.

Let me try to write some pseudocode:","def partition(head, x):

    less_dummy = ListNode(0)

    less_current = less_dummy

    greater_dummy = ListNode(0)

    while current:

        if current.val < x:

            less_current = less_current.next

        else:

   - This involves checking if the left part of the first string can be scrambled to match the left part of the second string and the right parts accordingly, or if swapping the parts helps in achieving the target.

            nums1[k] = nums2[j]
            j -= 1
        k -= 1
    while j >= 0:
        nums1[k] = nums2[j]
        k -= 1
        j -= 1
```
    
    We use a two-pointer approach to merge nums1 and nums2 in reverse order. Initialize three pointers i, j, and k pointing to the last elements of nums1, nums2, and the merged nums1 array respectively.

Iterate in a while loop until i and j are both less than 0. Compare the values of nums1[i] and nums2[j]. If nums1[i] is greater, assign nums1[i] at position k in nums1, decrement i and k. Otherwise, assign nums2[j] at position k in nums1, and decrement j and k. This process continues for all elements in nums2.

After the loop, if there are still elements remaining in nums2 (j >= 0), copy the remaining elements of nums2 to nums1. In this way, we merge nums1 and nums2 in non-decreasing order.
    ","You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array_ `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,2,3,0,0,0\], m = 3, nums2 = \[2,5,6\], n = 3
**Output:** \[1,2,2,3,5,6\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[1,2,3\] and \[2,5,6\].
The result of the merge is \[1,2,2,3,5,6\] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1\], m = 1, nums2 = \[\], n = 0
**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[1\] and \[\].
The result of the merge is \[1\].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[0\], m = 0, nums2 = \[1\], n = 1
**Output:** \[1\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[\] and \[1\].
The result of the merge is \[1\].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

**Constraints:**

*   `nums1.length == m + n`
*   `nums2.length == n`
*   `0 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `1 <= m + n <= 200`
*   `-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109`

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time? Additionally, the sky was clear that day.","So I've got this problem where I need to merge two sorted arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, into `nums1` such that `nums1` contains the sorted combination of both. The tricky part is that `nums1` is already big enough to hold both arrays, with the first `m` elements being the actual data and the last `n` elements being zeros that I can ignore.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have two sorted arrays:

- `nums1`: size `m + n`, with actual elements in the first `m` positions and the rest are zeros.

- `nums2`: size `n`, fully occupied with elements.

I need to merge these into `nums1` such that `nums1` contains all elements from both arrays in sorted order, without using any extra space outside of `nums1` and `nums2`.

Given that both arrays are sorted, the straightforward approach would be to use a two-pointer technique to merge them efficiently. However, since `nums1` has extra space at the end, and it's sorted, I should consider starting from the end to avoid overwriting elements in `nums1` before they're processed.

Let me think about the steps:

1. **Initialize Pointers:**

- Have a pointer for the last element in `nums1` that actually contains data, which is `m - 1`.

- Have a pointer for the last element in `nums2`, which is `n - 1`.

- Have a pointer for the position in `nums1` where the merged elements will be placed, starting from the end of the array, which is `m + n - 1`.

2. **Merge from the End:**

- Compare the elements at the current positions of the two pointers in `nums1` and `nums2`.

- Place the larger element at the current position in `nums1`.

- Move the pointer in the array from which the element was taken and the merged array pointer.

3. **Handle Remaining Elements:**

- If there are remaining elements in `nums2` after processing, copy them to the beginning of `nums1`.

I need to be careful with the indices to avoid going out of bounds.

Let me consider some examples to verify this approach.

**Example 1:**

- `nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0]`, `m = 3`

- `nums2 = [2,5,6]`, `n = 3`

- Start with pointers:

- `nums1`: index `2` (value `3`)

- `nums2`: index `2` (value `6`)

- Merge pointer: index `5`

- Compare `3` and `6`: `6` is larger, place `6` at index `5` in `nums1`.

- Move `nums2` pointer to `1` (value `5`), merge pointer to `4`.

- Compare `3` and `5`: `5` is larger, place `5` at index `4`.

- Move `nums2` pointer to `0` (value `2`), merge pointer to `3`.

- Compare `3` and `2`: `3` is larger, place `3` at index `3`.

- Move `nums1` pointer to `1` (value `2`), merge pointer to `2`.

- Compare `2` and `2`: they are equal, place `2` at index `2`.

- Move both `nums1` and `nums2` pointers to the left.

- Now, `nums1` pointer is at `-1`, and `nums2` pointer is at `-1`. No more elements to process.

- Final `nums1`: [1,2,2,3,5,6]

This matches the expected output.

**Example 2:**

- `nums1 = [1]`, `m = 1`

- `nums2 = []`, `n = 0`

- Nothing to merge. `nums1` remains [1].

**Example 3:**

- `nums1 = [0]`, `m = 0`

- `nums2 = [1]`, `n = 1`

- Since `m = 0`, `nums1` has no elements, so just place elements from `nums2`.

- Final `nums1`: [1]

This also matches the expected output.

Now, considering edge cases:

- If `n = 0`, then no elements from `nums2` to merge. `nums1` remains as is.

- If `m = 0`, then `nums1` is empty, so copy all elements from `nums2` to `nums1`.

- If both `m` and `n` are positive, perform the merge as described.

I need to ensure that the code handles these cases without errors.

Let me think about the implementation in code.

I'll use three pointers:

- `p1` pointing to `m - 1` (last element in `nums1`'s data)

- `p2` pointing to `n - 1` (last element in `nums2`)

- `p` pointing to `m + n - 1` (position to place the next largest element in `nums1`)

While `p1 >= 0` and `p2 >= 0`, compare `nums1[p1]` and `nums2[p2]`, place the larger one at `nums1[p]`, and decrement the corresponding pointer and `p`.

After the loop, if there are remaining elements in `nums2`, copy them to `nums1` starting from `p`.

Wait, actually, since `nums1`'s elements are already in place, and `nums2`'s elements are being merged in, I don't need to copy anything from `nums1` to `nums2`. But I need to make sure that if there are remaining elements in `nums2`, they are placed in the correct positions in `nums1`.

Wait, no. Since `nums1`'s elements are already in their positions, and we're merging `nums2` into `nums1`, I need to copy remaining elements from `nums2` to the beginning of `nums1` if any.

But in the initial approach, by merging from the end, I shouldn't have any remaining elements in `nums1` to worry about, as all elements are being placed from the end downwards.

Wait, let's think again.

Actually, in the merging process, if `nums2` has smaller elements, they will be placed before the elements of `nums1`. So, if `nums2` has elements left after the main loop, they are the smaller ones and should be placed in the beginning of `nums1`.

Let me try to write a small example to see.

**Example:**

- `nums1 = [4,5,6,0,0,0]`, `m = 3`

- `nums2 = [1,2,3]`, `n = 3`

- Start with:

- `p1 = 2` (value `6`)

- `p2 = 2` (value `3`)

- `p = 5`

- Compare `6` and `3`: `6` is larger, place `6` at index `5`.

- `p1 = 1` (value `5`), `p2 = 2` (value `3`), `p = 4`

- Compare `5` and `3`: `5` is larger, place `5` at index `4`.

- `p1 = 0` (value `4`), `p2 = 2` (value `3`), `p = 3`

- Compare `4` and `3`: `4` is larger, place `4` at index `3`.

- `p1 = -1`, `p2 = 2` (value `3`), `p = 2`

- Now, `p1` is `-1`, so copy remaining elements from `nums2` to `nums1` starting from index `0` to `p2`.

- Place `3` at index `2`, `2` at index `1`, and `1` at index `0`.

- Final `nums1`: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

This works correctly.

Another edge case:

- `nums1 = [2,0]`, `m = 1`

- `nums2 = [1]`, `n = 1`

- `p1 = 0` (value `2`)

- `p2 = 0` (value `1`)

- `p = 1`

- Compare `2` and `1`: `2` is larger, place `2` at index `1`.

- `p1 = -1`, `p2 = 0` (value `1`), `p = 0`

- Copy remaining element from `nums2` to `nums1` at index `0`.

- Final `nums1`: [1,2]

Correct.

Now, considering that `nums1` has enough space, I don't need to worry about overwriting elements before they are processed, as I'm starting from the end.

I should also consider the case where `n = 0`, meaning no elements from `nums2` to merge. In this case, `nums1` remains unchanged.

Similarly, if `m = 0`, then `nums1` is empty, and I just need to copy elements from `nums2` to `nums1`.

I need to handle these cases appropriately in the code to avoid errors like accessing negative indices.

Let me outline the steps again:

1. Initialize pointers:

- `p1 = m - 1`

- `p2 = n - 1`

- `p = m + n - 1`

2. While `p1 >= 0` and `p2 >= 0`:

a. If `nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]`:

- `nums1[p] = nums1[p1]`

- `p1 -= 1`

b. Else:

- `nums1[p] = nums2[p2]`

- `p2 -= 1`

c. `p -= 1`

3. If `p2 >= 0`:

a. Copy remaining elements from `nums2` to `nums1`, from index `0` to `p2`, placing them from `p` downwards.

This should cover all cases.

Now, to implement this in Python, I need to be careful with the indices to avoid going out of bounds.

Also, since the problem specifies that `nums1` has length `m + n`, and `nums2` has length `n`, I don't need to worry about the sizes.

I should also consider the time complexity. Since I'm iterating through both arrays once, the time complexity should be O(m + n), which matches the follow-up requirement.

Let me try to write the code based on this approach.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to merge two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` into a single sorted array stored inside `nums1`. The arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order, and `nums1` has sufficient space at the end to hold the elements of `nums2`.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We use three pointers:
     - `p1` starts at `m - 1`, the last index of elements in `nums1`.
     - `p2` starts at `n - 1`, the last index of elements in `nums2`.
     - `p` starts at `m + n - 1`, the last position in `nums1` where the merged elements will be placed.

2. **Merge from the End**:
   - Compare elements at `nums1[p1]` and `nums2[p2]`.
   - Place the larger element at `nums1[p]` and move the corresponding pointer.
   - Continue this process until all elements from both arrays are merged.

3. **Handle Remaining Elements**:
   - If there are remaining elements in `nums2` after the main loop, copy them to the beginning of `nums1`.

For those who might not know, a Gray code sequence is a list of binary numbers where each successive number differs from the previous one by only one bit. Also, the first and last numbers in the sequence should differ by only one bit, making it a cycle in a way.

So, the task is to write a function that, given an integer n, returns any valid sequence of n-bit Gray codes. The sequence should contain all numbers from 0 to 2^n - 1, each appearing exactly once, and each pair of consecutive numbers (including the first and last) should differ by exactly one bit.

Looking at the examples:

- For n = 2, one possible sequence is [0,1,3,2], whose binary representations are [00,01,11,10]. Each consecutive pair differs by one bit, and the first and last also differ by one bit.

- Another sequence [0,2,3,1] is also valid: [00,10,11,01], with the same properties.

- For n = 1, the sequence is simply [0,1], which in binary is [0,1], and they differ by one bit.

First, I need to understand how Gray codes work. Gray codes are useful because they minimize the chance of errors in systems that convert analog to digital signals, as only one bit changes at a time.

I recall that there is a standard way to generate Gray codes. One common method is to use the binary reflected Gray code, where you start with a single bit, reflect it, and then prefix the original and reflected parts with 0 and 1, respectively.

For example, for n=1:

- Start with [0,1]

For n=2:

- Take the n=1 sequence: [0,1]

- Reflect it: [1,0]

- Prefix the original with 0: [00,01]

- Prefix the reflection with 1: [11,10]

- Combine them: [00,01,11,10]

For n=3:

- Take n=2 sequence: [00,01,11,10]

- Reflect it: [10,11,01,00]

- Prefix the original with 0: [000,001,011,010]

- Prefix the reflection with 1: [110,111,101,100]

- Combine them: [000,001,011,010,110,111,101,100]

This pattern seems to be a recursive process, where each step builds on the previous one by reflection and prefixing.

So, perhaps I can implement this recursively. The base case is when n=1, returning [0,1]. For larger n, I can take the sequence for n-1, reflect it, prefix the original with 0 (which is just keeping the numbers as they are, since they are already n-1 bits), and prefix the reflection with 1 (which means adding 2^(n-1) to each number in the reflection).

Wait, actually, in terms of numbers, prefixing with 0 means keeping the number the same, and prefixing with 1 means adding 2^(n-1) to each number in the reflection.

Let me try this for n=2:

- n-1 =1, sequence: [0,1]

- Reflection: [1,0]

- Prefix original with 0: [0,1]

- Prefix reflection with 1: [1+2^(1)=3, 0+2^(1)=2]

- Combine: [0,1,3,2]

Which matches the example.

For n=3:

- n-1=2, sequence: [0,1,3,2]

- Reflection: [2,3,1,0]

- Prefix original with 0: [0,1,3,2]

- Prefix reflection with 1: [2+4=6,3+4=7,1+4=5,0+4=4]

- Combine: [0,1,3,2,6,7,5,4]

Which seems correct.

So, this recursive approach seems promising.

Alternatively, there's a direct formula to compute the Gray code for a given binary number: gray = binary XOR (binary right shifted by 1). But since I need the entire sequence, generating them recursively might be more straightforward.

Another way is to iterate from 0 to 2^n -1 and for each number, compute its Gray code using the formula gray = x XOR (x >> 1), and collect them in a list. However, I need to ensure that the sequence starts from 0 and each consecutive pair differs by one bit, including the first and last.

Wait, actually, using the formula gray = x XOR (x >> 1) for x from 0 to 2^n -1 generates a Gray code sequence that satisfies all the properties mentioned.

Let me verify this for n=2:

- x=0: 00 -> 00

- x=1: 01 -> 01

- x=2: 10 -> 11

- x=3: 11 -> 10

Which is [0,1,3,2], matching the example.

For n=3:

- x=0: 000 -> 000

- x=1: 001 -> 001

- x=2: 010 -> 011

- x=3: 011 -> 010

- x=4: 100 -> 110

- x=5: 101 -> 111

- x=6: 110 -> 101

- x=7: 111 -> 100

Which is [0,1,3,2,6,7,5,4], which matches the manual construction above.

This seems efficient, as it doesn't require recursion and can be computed in O(2^n) time, which should be acceptable since n can be up to 16, making 2^16 = 65536, which is manageable.

Let me think about implementing this. I can iterate from 0 to 2^n -1, and for each x, compute gray = x ^ (x >> 1), and append it to the list.

But I need to ensure that the first and last elements differ by exactly one bit. Given the properties of Gray codes generated this way, this should be automatically satisfied, as the sequence is cyclic in nature.

To confirm, for n=2, first is 0 (00) and last is 2 (10), which differ by one bit. For n=3, first is 0 (000) and last is 4 (100), which also differ by one bit.

Seems good.

Another way is to use the recursive reflection method I described earlier, building the sequence step by step from n=1 to the desired n.

But using the formula seems simpler and more efficient.

Let me consider the constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 16

- Need to return a list of integers representing the Gray code sequence.

- The sequence must include all integers from 0 to 2^n -1, each exactly once.

- Each pair of consecutive numbers (including the first and last) must differ by exactly one bit.

Given that, and knowing that the Gray code generated by x ^ (x >> 1) satisfies all these properties, I think this is the way to go.

Let me try to write a small piece of code to test this for n=2 and n=3.

For n=2:

- x=0: 0 ^ 0 = 0

- x=1: 1 ^ 0 = 1

- x=2: 2 ^ 1 = 3

- x=3: 3 ^ 1 = 2

Which is [0,1,3,2]

For n=3:

- x=0: 0 ^ 0 = 0

- x=1: 1 ^ 0 = 1

- x=2: 2 ^ 1 = 3

- x=3: 3 ^ 1 = 2

- x=4: 4 ^ 2 = 6

- x=5: 5 ^ 2 = 7

- x=6: 6 ^ 3 = 5

- x=7: 7 ^ 3 = 4

Which is [0,1,3,2,6,7,5,4]

Looks correct.

Now, in Python, the right shift operator (>>) for positive integers works as expected, but I need to ensure that it works correctly for all x in the range 0 to 2^n -1.

Also, Python handles large integers well, so n=16 should not be a problem.

Let me think about edge cases:

- n=1: [0,1]

- n=0: Not applicable, since n >=1 according to constraints.

- n=16: Large sequence, but should be fine.

I need to make sure that the function is efficient enough for n=16. Since it's O(2^n), and n=16 is 65536, which is acceptable.

Also, need to ensure that the function returns the sequence in the correct format, as a list of integers.

Let me consider writing the function step by step.

First, compute 2^n using bit shifting or the pow function.

Then, iterate from 0 to 2^n -1, compute gray = x ^ (x >> 1), and append to the list.

Finally, return the list.

Seems straightforward.

Let me consider if there's any way to optimize this further, but I think this is already optimal.

Let me also think about space complexity. Since we're generating a list of 2^n integers, space complexity is O(2^n), which is necessary since that's the size of the output.

I should also consider if there's a way to generate the sequence without storing the entire list in memory, but for this problem, since we need to return the entire sequence, it's not necessary.

Wait, in Python, lists can handle up to 2^16 elements easily, so no issues there.

Let me also think about the binary representation to confirm that the properties hold.

For example, for n=3:

- 0: 000

- 1: 001

- 3: 011

- 2: 010

- 6: 110

- 7: 111

- 5: 101

- 4: 100

Each consecutive pair differs by one bit:

- 000 and 001: differ in the least significant bit

- 001 and 011: differ in the second least significant bit

- 011 and 010: differ in the least significant bit

- 010 and 110: differ in the most significant bit

- 110 and 111: differ in the second least significant bit

- 111 and 101: differ in the most significant bit

- 101 and 100: differ in the least significant bit

- 100 and 000: differ in the most significant bit

Looks good.

I should also consider if there's any other property or constraint that this method might not satisfy, but given that Gray codes are widely used and this is a standard method to generate them, I think it should be fine.

Let me also think about the time complexity. Since we're iterating from 0 to 2^n -1, and performing constant time operations inside the loop, the time complexity is O(2^n), which is acceptable for n<=16.

Space complexity is also O(2^n), which is fine.

Let me consider writing the code now.

First, compute the length of the sequence: length = 1 << n (which is 2^n)

Then, initialize an empty list to store the sequence.

Iterate from x=0 to x<length:

gray = x ^ (x >> 1)

append gray to the list

return the list

Seems simple enough.

Let me test this logic with n=2:

x=0: 0 ^ 0 = 0

x=1: 1 ^ 0 = 1

x=2: 2 ^ 1 = 3

x=3: 3 ^ 1 = 2

Which matches the example.

For n=3:

x=0: 0 ^ 0 = 0

x=1: 1 ^ 0 = 1

x=2: 2 ^ 1 = 3

x=3: 3 ^ 1 = 2

x=4: 4 ^ 2 = 6

x=5: 5 ^ 2 = 7

x=6: 6 ^ 3 = 5

x=7: 7 ^ 3 = 4

Which also matches.

Looks good.

I think this should work.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to generate an n-bit Gray code sequence. A Gray code sequence is a sequence of `2^n` integers where:

1. Every integer is in the inclusive range `[0, 2^n - 1]`.
2. The first integer is `0`.
3. Each integer appears no more than once in the sequence.
4. Every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly one bit.
5. The first and last integers differ by exactly one bit.

### Approach

The approach used here is based on the properties of Gray codes. We can generate the Gray code sequence using the formula `gray = x ^ (x >> 1)`, where `x` ranges from `0` to `2^n - 1`. This formula ensures that each consecutive pair of numbers in the sequence differs by exactly one bit.

    The algorithm first sorts the given array, and then it generates all possible subsets. For each subset, it checks if it already exists in the result set. If not, it adds the subset to the result set.

The algorithm uses a backtracking approach. It starts with an empty subset and iteratively adds elements from the input array to the subset. It keeps track of the starting index to avoid creating duplicate subsets.

In the C++ and Java implementations, a `set` data structure is used to store unique subsets. In the Python implementation, Python's `set` is used along with itertools' `combinations` function to achieve the same result. In the JavaScript implementation, a `Set` object is used, but as it doesn't handle array comparisons properly, each subset is converted into a JSON string to compare the string representation of subsets.

At the end, the function returns the result set, converted into the desired format (list of lists or vector of vectors).

1. **Sorting the Array**: By sorting the array first, we group duplicates together, which makes it easier to skip over them and avoid creating duplicate subsets.
   
2. **Backtracking**: We use a backtracking approach to generate all possible subsets. Backtracking is a systematic way to iterate through all possible configurations of a problem by building candidates incrementally and abandoning a candidate as soon as it is determined that the candidate cannot lead to a valid solution.

The problem is about decoding a string of digits into letters based on a specific mapping where 'A' is 1, 'B' is 2,..., 'Z' is 26. The goal is to find out how many ways we can decode a given string.

First, I need to understand the constraints and examples provided.

Constraints:

- The string `s` contains only digits.

- The string `s` can have leading zeros.

Examples:

1. For ""12"", it can be decoded as ""AB"" (1 2) or ""L"" (12), so there are 2 ways.

2. For ""226"", it can be decoded as ""BZ"" (2 26), ""VF"" (22 6), or ""BBF"" (2 2 6), so there are 3 ways.

3. For ""06"", it cannot be decoded because ""06"" starts with '0', which is invalid.

From these examples, I can see that the decoding rules are:

- Single digit: Any digit from '1' to '9' can be decoded into 'A' to 'I'.

- Two digits: Any number from '10' to '26' can be decoded into 'J' to 'Z'.

- '0' cannot stand alone; it must be part of a two-digit number like '10' or '20'.

- However, if the string starts with '0' or contains '0's that cannot be part of a valid two-digit number, the decoding is invalid.

So, my task is to count the number of possible ways to decode the entire string based on these rules.

I think this is a dynamic programming problem because the number of ways to decode a string depends on the number of ways to decode its substrings.

Let me try to formalize the approach.

Define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to decode the substring `s[0..i-1]`.

I need to find `dp[n]`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

Base cases:

- `dp[0]`: There is one way to decode an empty string, which is doing nothing. So, `dp[0] = 1`.

- `dp[1]`: If `s[0]` is between '1' and '9', then `dp[1] = 1`. If `s[0]` is '0', then `dp[1] = 0` because '0' cannot stand alone.

Recurrence relation:

For `i` from 2 to `n+1`:

- If `s[i-1]` is between '1' and '9', then we can take it as a single digit, so `dp[i] += dp[i-1]`.

- If the two-digit number formed by `s[i-2]` and `s[i-1]` is between '10' and '26', then we can take these two digits together, so `dp[i] += dp[i-2]`.

At the end, `dp[n]` will give the number of ways to decode the entire string.

Let me test this logic with the example ""12"".

- `dp[0] = 1`

- `dp[1]`: '1' is between '1' and '9', so `dp[1] = 1`

- `dp[2]`:

- '2' is between '1' and '9', so `dp[2] += dp[1] = 1`

- '12' is between '10' and '26', so `dp[2] += dp[0] = 1`

- Total `dp[2] = 2`, which matches the example.

Another example: ""226""

- `dp[0] = 1`

- `dp[1]`: '2' is between '1' and '9', so `dp[1] = 1`

- `dp[2]`:

- '2' is between '1' and '9', so `dp[2] += dp[1] = 1`

- '22' is between '10' and '26', so `dp[2] += dp[0] = 1`

- Total `dp[2] = 2`

- `dp[3]`:

- '6' is between '1' and '9', so `dp[3] += dp[2] = 2`

- '26' is between '10' and '26', so `dp[3] += dp[1] = 1`

- Total `dp[3] = 3`, which matches the example.

Now, let's consider ""06""

- `dp[0] = 1`

- `dp[1]`: '0' is not between '1' and '9', so `dp[1] = 0`

- Since `dp[1] = 0`, and '06' cannot be formed as a two-digit number because it starts with '0', `dp[2] = 0`, which matches the example.

Seems like the logic is correct.

Now, I need to implement this in Python.

I'll use a list `dp` of size `n+1`, where `n` is the length of the string.

Initialize `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1` if `s[0]` is between '1' and '9', else `0`.

Then, for each `i` from 2 to `n+1`, calculate `dp[i]` based on the above rules.

Finally, return `dp[n]`.

I need to handle the two-digit cases carefully, making sure that the two-digit number is between '10' and '26'.

Also, I need to handle the case where the string starts with '0', which is invalid.

Let me write a draft of the code.","def numDecodings(s: str) -> int:

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a dummy node that points to the head of the list. This helps in handling the case when `left` is 1.
   - Initialize a pointer `pre` to the dummy node. This pointer will keep track of the node before the sublist to be reversed.

2. **Positioning**:
   - Move the `pre` pointer to the node just before the `left` position. This involves moving `pre` `left - 1` times.

3. **Reversing the Sublist**:
   - Initialize three pointers: `cur` to the next node of `pre`, `next` to the node after `cur`, and `temp` to keep track of the node after `next`.
   - Iterate from `left` to `right`, reversing the pointers between these nodes.
   - In each iteration, adjust the pointers to reverse the direction of the links.

4. **Connecting the Reversed Sublist**:
   - After reversing, connect the `pre` node to the new start of the reversed sublist (which is the last node of the reversed part).
   - Connect the end of the reversed sublist to the node after the original `right` position.

5. **Return the Modified List**:
   - Return the next node of the dummy, which is the new head of the list.

We then call the dfs function recursively, with the current index incremented by one, the current IP appended with the current character and a dot, and incrementing part by 1. If the current number is 0 (which indicates a leading zero), we also break the iteration.

*   `s` consists of digits only. Additionally, the sky was clear that day.","To solve this problem, we need to generate all possible valid IP addresses from a given string `s` containing only digits. The IP addresses must adhere to the standard format of four integers separated by dots, with each integer ranging from 0 to 255 and without leading zeros.

### Approach

1. **Backtracking**: We'll use a backtracking approach to explore all possible ways to insert dots into the string to form valid IP addresses.
2. **Validation**: At each step, we'll validate the substring to ensure it forms a valid IP segment (no leading zeros, value between 0 and 255).
3. **Recursive Function**: We'll define a recursive function that tries to add segments to the current IP address being built, ensuring that we never exceed four segments and that each segment is valid.
4. **Base Case**: If we have exactly four segments and have used the entire string, we have a valid IP address.

*   `1 <= n <= 8` John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","I've got this problem to solve: given an integer n, I need to generate all unique binary search trees (BSTs) that have exactly n nodes with unique values from 1 to n. The trees should be structurally unique, meaning their structures are different, not necessarily the values they hold.

First, I need to understand what a binary search tree is. In a BST, for any given node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value. So, for n=3, the possible unique BST structures are what I need to generate, each filled with the values 1, 2, and 3 in some order, but maintaining the BST property.

I recall that the number of unique BSTs for a given n is given by the Catalan number C_n, which for n=3 is 5, matching the first example provided. So, for n=3, there should be 5 unique BST structures.

Now, to approach this problem, I need to think recursively because BSTs have recursive definitions. For each possible root value (from 1 to n), I can consider all possible left subtrees (which will be BSTs of values less than the root) and all possible right subtrees (which will be BSTs of values greater than the root). Then, for each combination of left and right subtrees, I can create a new tree with the current root.

So, for n=3:

- If root is 1, left subtree is empty (no value less than 1), right subtree has values 2 and 3.

- If root is 2, left subtree has value 1, right subtree has value 3.

- If root is 3, left subtree has values 1 and 2, right subtree is empty.

I need to generate all possible combinations for each case.

This sounds like a job for recursion. I can define a function that generates all unique BSTs for a given range of values, say from start to end. Then, for each value in that range, I can recursively generate all possible left and right subtrees and combine them with the current root.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Define a function, say `generate_trees(start, end)`, which returns a list of all unique BSTs for the values from start to end.

2. If start > end, return a list containing None, representing an empty tree.

3. For each value `i` from start to end:

a. Recursively get all left subtrees from `generate_trees(start, i-1)`.

b. Recursively get all right subtrees from `generate_trees(i+1, end)`.

c. For each left subtree and each right subtree, create a new tree with `i` as the root, left as the left subtree, and right as the right subtree.

d. Add this new tree to the list of trees.

4. Return the list of trees.

Then, to solve the problem, I can call `generate_trees(1, n)`.

I need to make sure that the trees are constructed correctly, maintaining the BST property.

Let me consider n=3:

- generate_trees(1,3):

- i=1:

- left = generate_trees(1,0) => [None]

- right = generate_trees(2,3):

- i=2:

- left = generate_trees(2,1) => [None]

- right = generate_trees(3,3):

- i=3:

- left = generate_trees(3,2) => [None]

- right = generate_trees(4,3) => [None]

- Create tree with root=3, left=None, right=None

- So, right = [Tree(3)]

- Create tree with root=2, left=None, right=Tree(3)

- So, right = [Tree(2, None, Tree(3))]

- i=3:

- left = generate_trees(3,2) => [None]

- right = generate_trees(4,3) => [None]

- Create tree with root=3, left=None, right=None

- So, right = [Tree(3)]

- Create tree with root=1, left=None, right=Tree(2, None, Tree(3)))

- Create tree with root=1, left=None, right=Tree(3))

- Wait, I think I'm missing some combinations here.

Hmm, maybe I need to think more carefully about how to combine the left and right subtrees.

Let me try to write some pseudocode:

function generate_trees(start, end):

if start > end:

return [None]

trees = []

for i from start to end:

left_subtrees = generate_trees(start, i-1)

right_subtrees = generate_trees(i+1, end)

for each left in left_subtrees:

for each right in right_subtrees:

new_tree = TreeNode(i)

new_tree.left = left

new_tree.right = right

trees.append(new_tree)

return trees

Then, to get all unique BSTs for n=3, call generate_trees(1,3).

Let's see for n=3:

- generate_trees(1,3):

- i=1:

- left_subtrees = generate_trees(1,0) => [None]

- right_subtrees = generate_trees(2,3):

- generate_trees(2,3):

- i=2:

- left_subtrees = generate_trees(2,1) => [None]

- right_subtrees = generate_trees(3,3):

- generate_trees(3,3):

- i=3:

- left_subtrees = generate_trees(3,2) => [None]

- right_subtrees = generate_trees(4,3) => [None]

- new_tree = TreeNode(3)

- trees = [Tree(3)]

- So, right_subtrees = [Tree(3)]

- new_tree = TreeNode(2, None, Tree(3))

- trees = [Tree(2, None, Tree(3))]

- i=3:

- left_subtrees = generate_trees(3,2) => [None]

- right_subtrees = generate_trees(4,3) => [None]

- new_tree = TreeNode(3)

- trees.append(Tree(3))

- So, for i=1:

- trees.append(Tree(1, None, Tree(2, None, Tree(3))))

- trees.append(Tree(1, None, Tree(3)))

- i=2:

- left_subtrees = generate_trees(1,1):

- generate_trees(1,1):

- i=1:

- left_subtrees = generate_trees(1,0) => [None]

- right_subtrees = generate_trees(2,1) => [None]

- new_tree = TreeNode(1)

- trees = [Tree(1)]

- right_subtrees = generate_trees(3,3):

- [Tree(3)]

- new_tree = TreeNode(2, Tree(1), Tree(3))

- trees.append(Tree(2, Tree(1), Tree(3)))

- i=3:

- left_subtrees = generate_trees(1,2):

- generate_trees(1,2):

- i=1:

- left_subtrees = [None]

- right_subtrees = generate_trees(2,2):

- [Tree(2)]

- new_tree = TreeNode(1, None, Tree(2))

- trees = [Tree(1, None, Tree(2))]

- i=2:

- left_subtrees = generate_trees(1,1):

- [Tree(1)]

- right_subtrees = [None]

- new_tree = TreeNode(2, Tree(1), None)

- trees.append(Tree(2, Tree(1), None))

- right_subtrees = generate_trees(4,3) => [None]

- new_tree = TreeNode(3, Tree(1, None, Tree(2)), None)

- trees.append(Tree(3, Tree(1, None, Tree(2)), None))

- new_tree = TreeNode(3, Tree(2, Tree(1), None), None)

- trees.append(Tree(3, Tree(2, Tree(1), None), None))

So, in total, for n=3, we have:

1. Tree(1, None, Tree(2, None, Tree(3)))

2. Tree(1, None, Tree(3))

3. Tree(2, Tree(1), Tree(3))

4. Tree(3, Tree(1, None, Tree(2)), None)

5. Tree(3, Tree(2, Tree(1), None), None)

Which matches the 5 unique BSTs for n=3.

Great, so the recursive approach seems to work.

Now, I need to implement this in Python. I need to define the TreeNode class as well, as it's a common structure for binary trees.

In Python, the TreeNode class is usually defined like this:

class TreeNode:

def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):

self.val = val

self.left = left

self.right = right

Then, I can implement the generate_trees function as described.

But, since the problem might have the trees with values from 1 to n, I need to ensure that the values are correctly assigned in the trees.

Also, the problem mentions returning the answer in any order, so I don't need to worry about the order of the trees in the output list.

Let me try to write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to generate all structurally unique Binary Search Trees (BSTs) that have exactly `n` nodes with unique values from 1 to `n`. We will use a recursive approach to achieve this.

### Approach

1. **Define the TreeNode Class:**
   - We first define the `TreeNode` class which will be used to create the nodes of the BSTs.

2. **Generate Unique BSTs Recursively:**
   - We use a recursive function `generate_unique_bsts(start, end)` that generates all possible BSTs for the given range of values from `start` to `end`.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, we return a list containing `None` to represent an empty tree.
   - For each value `i` from `start` to `end`, we consider it as the root and recursively generate all possible left and right subtrees.
   - We combine each left subtree with each right subtree and create a new tree with `i` as the root.

3. **Combine Subtrees:**
   - For each possible root value, we combine the left and right subtrees generated recursively to form the complete BSTs.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - Finally, we call the recursive function with the range from 1 to `n` to generate all unique BSTs with nodes having values from 1 to `n`.

*   `1 <= n <= 19` John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","I've got this problem here: given an integer n, I need to find out how many unique binary search trees (BSTs) can be created with exactly n nodes, each having unique values from 1 to n. The examples given are for n=3, the output is 5, and for n=1, it's 1. The constraints are that n is between 1 and 19, inclusive.

First, I need to understand what a binary search tree is. A BST is a binary tree where for each node, all elements in its left subtree are less than the node, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than the node. Also, the structure of the tree matters; two trees are different if their structures differ or the nodes differ in position.

So, the task is to count the number of unique BST structures that can be formed with n distinct nodes labeled from 1 to n.

I recall that the number of unique BSTs for a given n is related to Catalan numbers. Catalan numbers appear in many counting problems in combinatorics, and one of them is the number of unique BSTs with n nodes.

The formula for the nth Catalan number is:

\[ C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} \]

But I'm not sure if directly computing the Catalan number is the best approach here, especially since n can be up to 19, and factorials can get large quickly.

Alternatively, I can think recursively. For a BST with n nodes, I can choose any of the n nodes as the root. Suppose I choose k as the root, then the left subtree will contain nodes less than k, and the right subtree will contain nodes greater than k.

Since the nodes are labeled from 1 to n, if k is the root, then the left subtree will have nodes from 1 to k-1, and the right subtree will have nodes from k+1 to n.

The number of unique BSTs for the left subtree is the number of unique BSTs with k-1 nodes, and similarly, for the right subtree, it's the number of unique BSTs with n - k nodes.

So, the total number of unique BSTs with n nodes is the sum over all possible k from 1 to n of (number of unique BSTs with k-1 nodes * number of unique BSTs with n - k nodes).

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem where I can build up the solution from smaller subproblems.

Let me define dp[i] as the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with i nodes.

Then, dp[i] = sum over k=1 to i of dp[k-1] * dp[i - k]

With the base case dp[0] = 1 (there's one empty tree) and dp[1] = 1 (a single node tree).

Let me try to compute dp[2]:

dp[2] = dp[0] * dp[1] + dp[1] * dp[0] = 1*1 + 1*1 = 2

So, there are 2 unique BSTs with 2 nodes.

dp[3] = dp[0]*dp[2] + dp[1]*dp[1] + dp[2]*dp[0) = 1*2 + 1*1 + 2*1 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5

Which matches the example given for n=3.

Similarly, dp[1] = 1, which matches the second example.

This seems promising.

Let me try to compute dp[4]:

dp[4] = dp[0]*dp[3] + dp[1]*dp[2] + dp[2]*dp[1] + dp[3]*dp[0]

= 1*5 + 1*2 + 2*1 + 5*1

= 5 + 2 + 2 + 5 = 14

So, there are 14 unique BSTs with 4 nodes.

This seems consistent.

Now, I need to implement this in Python. Since n can be up to 19, and we're dealing with integers, Python's integer type should handle these values without issue.

I'll use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where I initialize a list dp of size n+1, set dp[0] = 1 and dp[1] = 1, and then iteratively compute dp[2] to dp[n] using the formula above.

Let me sketch this out:

Initialize dp = [0] * (n+1)

Set dp[0] = 1

Set dp[1] = 1

For i in range(2, n+1):

for k in range(1, i+1):

dp[i] += dp[k-1] * dp[i - k]

Finally, return dp[n]

This should work.

Let me test this logic with n=3:

dp[0] = 1

dp[1] = 1

dp[2] = dp[0]*dp[1] + dp[1]*dp[0] = 1*1 + 1*1 = 2

dp[3] = dp[0]*dp[2] + dp[1]*dp[1] + dp[2]*dp[0] = 1*2 + 1*1 + 2*1 = 5

Correct.

Another test with n=1:

dp[0] = 1

dp[1] = 1

Done. Return dp[1] = 1

Correct.

Edge case: n=0

According to the problem, n >=1, so I don't need to handle n=0.

But in my dp array, dp[0] is used as a base case.

I need to make sure that dp[0] is handled correctly.

In programming languages, arrays are 0-indexed, so dp[0] corresponds to the number of unique BSTs with 0 nodes, which is 1 (empty tree).

Okay, that makes sense.

Now, implement this in Python.

I need to define a function, say numTrees(n), that takes an integer n and returns the number of unique BSTs.

I should also consider the constraints: 1 <= n <= 19

Given that, I can proceed with the dynamic programming approach.

Let me write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of structurally unique Binary Search Trees (BSTs) that can be created with exactly `n` nodes, each having unique values from 1 to `n`. This is a classic problem that can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming.

### Approach
The number of unique BSTs for a given number of nodes `n` follows the Catalan sequence. Instead of computing Catalan numbers directly, we can use a dynamic programming approach to build up the solution from smaller subproblems.

1. **DP Definition:** 
   - Let `dp[i]` represent the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with `i` nodes.
   
2. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[0] = 1`: There is one empty tree.
   - `dp[1] = 1`: There is one single-node tree.
   
3. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - For `i` nodes, choose each possible root `k` (from 1 to `i`), and calculate the number of unique BSTs formed by combining the left subtree (`k-1` nodes) and the right subtree (`i - k` nodes).
   - `dp[i] = dp[0]*dp[i-1] + dp[1]*dp[i-2] +... + dp[i-1]*dp[0]`
   
4. **Build the DP Table:**
   - Iteratively compute `dp[i]` for `i` from 2 to `n` using the recurrence relation.

        for k in range(1, i + 1):

    The algorithm follows a simple recursive approach to determine if a given binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST). The key idea is to maintain a range for each node, which is defined by the minimum and maximum values that the node's value should be within. For example, the root node's value should be in the range of (-Infinity, Infinity). When traversing to the left child, the maximum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value, and for traversing to the right child, the minimum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value. The algorithm continues recursively in this manner.

A helper function, `isValidBSTHelper`, is defined and initialized with the root and the range (-Infinity, Infinity). If the node is `null`, it means that we have reached a leaf node and it should return `true`. If the value of the node is not within the specified range, it means that the node does not meet the BST requirement and the helper function should return `false`. If the node is valid, then the helper function proceeds to check for valid BSTs in its left and right subtrees with the updated range.

To determine if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST), we need to ensure that for every node, the left subtree contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key. Additionally, both subtrees must also be binary search trees.

One effective way to solve this problem is through a depth-first search (DFS) approach, where we keep track of the valid range for each node's value as we traverse the tree. Initially, the root node can have any value within the limits of the problem constraints, but as we move to its left and right children, their values must be within specific ranges based on their positions.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Define a helper function** that takes a node and its allowed minimum and maximum values.
2. **Check if the current node's value is within the allowed range**. If not, return False.
3. **Recursively validate the left subtree** by ensuring that all nodes in the left subtree are less than the current node's value.
4. **Recursively validate the right subtree** by ensuring that all nodes in the right subtree are greater than the current node's value.
5. **If all checks pass for all nodes**, the tree is a valid BST.

We need to handle the edge cases where node values can be as low as -2^31 and as high as 2^31 - 1, so we should use None to represent negative and positive infinity initially.

Let's implement this logic in Python.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST). A valid BST must satisfy the following conditions:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

### Approach

1. **Define a Helper Function**: 
   - Use a helper function that takes a node and the allowable range for its value, defined by a minimum and maximum value.
   
2. **Check Node Value**:
   - If the node's value is not within the allowable range, return `False`.
   
3. **Recursive Validation**:
   - Recursively validate the left subtree ensuring all nodes are less than the current node's value.
   - Recursively validate the right subtree ensuring all nodes are greater than the current node's value.
   
4. **Initial Range**:
   - Start with the root node, which has no restrictions, using `None` for both minimum and maximum values.

1. Traverse the BST using Inorder traversal, and at each node, compare its value with the previous node.

John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","I'm here to help you with your problem. It seems like you're dealing with a binary search tree (BST) where two nodes have been mistakenly swapped, and you need to recover the tree by swapping them back without changing its structure. The challenge is to do this efficiently, preferably with constant space.

First, let's understand the problem. In a BST, for any given node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value. When two nodes are swapped, this property is violated, and we need to identify and swap these two nodes back to restore the BST property.

### Approach

1. **Identify the swapped nodes:**
   - Perform an in-order traversal of the tree. In a correct BST, an in-order traversal produces a sorted list of values.
   - During the traversal, keep track of the previous node. If we find a node whose value is less than the previous node's value, it indicates a violation of the BST property.
   - There can be two scenarios:
     - **Case 1:** The two swapped nodes are adjacent in the in-order traversal. In this case, there will be only one violation.
     - **Case 2:** The two swapped nodes are not adjacent in the in-order traversal. In this case, there will be two violations.

2. **Correct the swapped nodes:**
   - Once we identify the violated nodes, we can swap their values to correct the BST.

First, let's understand what a binary tree is. A binary tree is a data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. In this problem, we're given the roots of two binary trees, p and q, and we need to check if these two trees are identical.

To solve this, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to compare the current nodes of both trees and then recursively check the left and right subtrees.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Base Case:**
   - If both p and q are `None`, meaning we've reached the end of both trees without finding any differences, return `True`.
   - If one of p or q is `None` but not the other, meaning the structures differ, return `False`.
   - If the values of the current nodes p.val and q.val are not equal, return `False`.

2. **Recursive Case:**
   - Recursively check the left subtrees of p and q.
   - Recursively check the right subtrees of p and q.
   - Return `True` only if both the left and right subtrees are the same.

This approach ensures that we traverse both trees simultaneously and compare their structures and node values at each step.

Let's consider the examples provided:

**Example 1:**

Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]

Output: true

In this case, both trees have the same structure and node values, so the function should return `True`.

**Example 2:**

Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]

Output: false

Here, the first tree has a left child with value 2 and no right child, while the second tree has a right child with value 2 and no left child. Thus, the structures differ, and the function should return `False`.

**Example 3:**

Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]

Output: false

In this example, both trees have the same structure, but the values of the children differ, so the function should return `False`.

Now, let's think about the constraints:

- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].

- -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4

Given these constraints, we don't need to worry about very large trees or extreme values, so a simple recursive solution should work efficiently.

The function then checks whether the values of both nodes are equal and continues to call itself recursively, but with the arguments changed to evaluate the left subtree and right subtree symmetrically. If the left and right subtrees have symmetric nodes, the function will return true; otherwise, it will return false.

The recursive calls in the helper function flip the direction of traversal for both subtrees to ensure that the subtrees are compared symmetrically. In each recursive call, the appropriate child nodes are visited in opposite directions to make sure they can be properly compared.

     - The right subtree of one node should be a mirror of the left subtree of the other node.

2. **Iterative Approach:**

For the binary tree level order traversal problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. BFS is naturally suited for level-order traversal because it processes nodes level by level.

1. **Check for Empty Tree:** If the tree is empty (i.e., `root` is `None`), return an empty list.
2. **Initialize Queue:** Use a queue to keep track of nodes at each level. Start by adding the root node to the queue.
3. **Process Each Level:** While the queue is not empty, process all nodes at the current level.
   - For each level, calculate the number of nodes at that level (which is the current queue size).
   - Dequeue each node from the queue and add its value to the current level's list.
   - Enqueue the left and right children of each node if they exist.
4. **Collect Results:** After processing all nodes at a level, add the level's list to the result list.
5. **Return Result:** Once the queue is empty, return the result list containing all levels.

This approach ensures that nodes are visited level by level, from left to right, which is exactly what we need for level order traversal.

Let's proceed to implement this in Python.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to perform a level order traversal on a binary tree and return the nodes' values organized by levels. This can be efficiently achieved using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach.

### Approach

1. **Check for Empty Tree:** If the root is `None`, return an empty list.
2. **Initialize Queue:** Use a queue to manage the nodes during traversal. Start by adding the root node to the queue.
3. **Process Each Level:**
   - While the queue is not empty, process all nodes at the current level.
   - For each level, calculate the number of nodes at that level (which is the current queue size).
   - Dequeue each node from the queue and add its value to a list for the current level.
   - Enqueue the left and right children of each node if they exist.
4. **Collect Results:** After processing all nodes at a level, add the list of values for that level to the result list.
5. **Return Result:** Once the queue is empty, return the result list containing all levels.

This approach ensures that we visit nodes level by level, from left to right, which is the requirement for level order traversal.

So, I need to traverse the tree level by level, but zigzag style, meaning one level from left to right and the next from right to left, alternating between levels.

First, I need to understand what a binary tree is. A binary tree is a data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node in the tree is called the root.

In this problem, I'm given the root of a binary tree, and I need to return the nodes' values in a zigzag level order traversal. That means that for level 0 (the root), I should collect the values from left to right. For level 1, I should collect from right to left, and so on, alternating directions at each level.

Looking at the examples provided:

- For the input [3,9,20,null,null,15,7], the output is [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]. So, level 0 has 3, level 1 has 20 and 9 (from right to left), and level 2 has 15 and 7 (from left to right).

- For the input [1], the output is [[1]], which makes sense as it's just the root node.

- For an empty tree, represented by [], the output is an empty list, which is straightforward.

I need to figure out how to traverse the tree in this specific order. I know that a regular level order traversal can be done using a queue, where I process each level from left to right. But here, I need to alternate the direction at each level.

One approach that comes to mind is to still use a queue to keep track of the nodes at each level, but to keep track of the current level's direction. I can maintain a flag that indicates whether the current level should be traversed from left to right or right to left.

Here's a rough plan:

1. Check if the root is null. If it is, return an empty list.

2. Initialize a queue and add the root node to it.

3. Initialize an empty list to store the result.

4. Initialize a flag to indicate the direction: True for left to right, False for right to left. Start with True for the root level.

5. While the queue is not empty:

a. Determine the number of nodes at the current level.

b. Initialize an empty list to store the values of the current level.

c. Process each node in the current level:

- Dequeue a node.

- If the direction flag is True, append the node's value to the level list.

- If the direction flag is False, insert the node's value at the beginning of the level list.

- Enqueue the left and right children of the node, if they exist.

d. After processing all nodes in the current level, append the level list to the result list.

e. Toggle the direction flag for the next level.

6. Return the result list.

Wait a minute, this might not be the most efficient way, especially the part about inserting at the beginning of the level list when the direction is right to left. Inserting at the beginning of a list is inefficient in Python because lists are implemented as dynamic arrays, and inserting at the beginning requires shifting all elements.

A better approach would be to use a deque (double-ended queue) for the level list, which allows efficient appends and pops from both ends.

Alternatively, I could collect the nodes in the normal order and then reverse the list for levels that need to be in right to left direction.

Let me think about that.

Option 1:

- Use a queue to traverse the tree level by level.

- For each level, if the level number is even, collect nodes from left to right.

- If the level number is odd, collect nodes from right to left.

- To collect from right to left, I can either:

- Collect nodes in a list and reverse it before adding to the result.

- Or, collect nodes in a deque, appending to the left when the level is odd.

Option 2:

- Use two stacks to alternate between levels.

- One stack for the current level and one for the next level.

- For each level, pop nodes from the current stack and add their children to the next stack, alternating the order.

But using a queue seems more straightforward.

Let me try to formalize the first option.

Algorithm:

1. If the root is null, return an empty list.

2. Initialize a queue and add the root node to it.

3. Initialize an empty list to store the result.

4. Initialize a level counter starting at 0.

5. While the queue is not empty:

a. Determine the number of nodes at the current level.

b. Initialize an empty list for the current level.

c. For each node in the current level:

- Dequeue a node.

- Append the node's value to the level list.

- Enqueue the left and right children of the node, if they exist.

d. If the level counter is odd, reverse the level list.

e. Append the level list to the result list.

f. Increment the level counter.

6. Return the result list.

Wait, in this case, I'm reversing the level list if the level counter is odd, which would correspond to levels that should be traversed from right to left.

But in the first example, level 1 (which is odd, starting from 0) should be from right to left, so reversing it makes sense if I collected it from left to right initially.

Yes, that seems correct.

Let me test this logic with the first example:

- Level 0: 3 → [3]

- Level 1: 9, 20 → [9, 20], but since level 1 is odd, reverse it to [20, 9]

- Level 2: 15, 7 → [15, 7], level 2 is even, so no reversal

- Final result: [[3], [20, 9], [15, 7]]

Which matches the expected output.

Good.

Now, considering the constraints:

- The number of nodes is between 0 and 2000.

- Node values are between -100 and 100.

I need to ensure that the solution is efficient enough for the upper bound of 2000 nodes. Since the traversal is O(n), it should be fine.

I should also consider edge cases:

- Empty tree: []

- Single node: [1]

- Tree with multiple levels and varying number of children.

I need to make sure that my code handles these cases correctly.

Also, I need to define the TreeNode class, as it's not provided.

In Python, I can define TreeNode as follows:","python

    The algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) on both the preorder and inorder traversal results. This algorithm iteratively breaks the inorder sequence into left and right subtrees using the preorder array. The basic idea is that the first element of preorder traversal will always be the root of the tree. Then, we can find that root node's index in the inorder traversal, and create the left subtree from the elements to the left of the index, and the right subtree from the elements to the right of the index. Then we continue this process recursively.

To improve the performance of the search for the index, we can use a map (in C++, Java and JavaScript) or a dictionary (in Python) to store the indices of all elements in the inorder traversal. This way, we don't need to traverse the inorder array every time to find the index of the current element.

Since we're doing this for Python, Java, C++ and JavaScript, some data structures might look a bit different and have different functions to do the same action, but the algorithm used in all languages is the same.

- Preorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- Inorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- A map is used to store the indices for inorder traversal in C++, Java, and JavaScript, while a dictionary is used in Python.
- A helper function is used to recursively construct the tree.
- For Python and JavaScript, the scope of pre_idx is made non-local, so it does not require additional arguments.

The resulting functions return the root node of the reconstructed binary tree.

    We are given the inorder and postorder traversals of a binary tree, and the task is to reconstruct the binary tree from this information. In the postorder traversal, the last element is the root of the tree. Knowing the root, we can divide the inorder traversal into left and right subtrees. With the knowledge of the left subtree size, we can divide the postorder traversal into left and right subtrees as well. We can then recursively build the left and right subtrees, and construct the tree accordingly.

The provided solution maintains a hashmap to keep the indexes of elements in the inorder traversal for easy access during the construction. It uses a helper function `_build` to carry out the recursive construction. The `_build` function takes in the range of elements to be considered in both inorder and postorder traversals and recursively constructs the tree, by dividing the inorder and postorder ranges into left and right subtrees, using the root found in the postorder traversal.
    ","Given two integer arrays `inorder` and `postorder` where `inorder` is the inorder traversal of a binary tree and `postorder` is the postorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return _the binary tree_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** inorder = \[9,3,15,20,7\], postorder = \[9,15,7,20,3\]

*   `postorder.length == inorder.length`
*   `-3000 <= inorder[i], postorder[i] <= 3000`
*   `inorder` and `postorder` consist of **unique** values.
*   Each value of `postorder` also appears in `inorder`.
*   `inorder` is **guaranteed** to be the inorder traversal of the tree.
*   `postorder` is **guaranteed** to be the postorder traversal of the tree. Additionally, the sky was clear that day.","To solve this problem, we need to construct a binary tree from its inorder and postorder traversals. Let's break down the process step by step.

### Approach

1. **Understand Traversals**:
   - **Inorder Traversal**: Left subtree -> Root -> Right subtree.
   - **Postorder Traversal**: Left subtree -> Right subtree -> Root.

2. **Identify Root**:
   - In postorder traversal, the last element is always the root of the current subtree.

3. **Divide Inorder Traversal**:
   - Once we have the root from the postorder traversal, we can find its position in the inorder traversal.
   - Elements to the left of this root in inorder are part of the left subtree.
   - Elements to the right are part of the right subtree.

4. **Recursively Build Subtrees**:
   - Use the counts of elements in the left and right subtrees from the inorder traversal to divide the postorder traversal into parts corresponding to left and right subtrees.
   - Recursively construct the left and right subtrees.

5. **Base Case**:
   - If there are no elements in the current subtree (inorder or postorder slice is empty), return `None`.

A height-balanced BST is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than one.

Given that the input array is sorted in ascending order, we can take advantage of this property to efficiently construct the BST. The idea is to repeatedly choose the middle element of the array as the root of the current subtree, and then recursively do the same for the left and right halves of the array.

### Approach

1. **Choose the Middle Element as Root**: By selecting the middle element of the array, we ensure that the tree is balanced because the middle element divides the array into two halves of equal size (or nearly equal if the array size is odd).
2. **Recursively Construct Subtrees**: The left half of the array (elements to the left of the middle element) will form the left subtree, and the right half will form the right subtree. We recursively apply the same process to these halves.
3. **Base Case**: If the array slice being considered is empty (i.e., start index is greater than end index), return `None` to indicate no node.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given the head of a singly linked list that is sorted in ascending order.
   - We need to convert this linked list into a height-balanced BST.

2. **Key Concepts:**
   - **Height-Balanced BST:** A binary search tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than one.
   - **Sorted Linked List:** The elements in the linked list are in ascending order.

3. **Intuition:**
   - To create a height-balanced BST from a sorted array, we can pick the middle element as the root, then recursively do the same for the left and right halves.
   - Since we have a linked list, we need a way to find the middle element efficiently.

4. **Algorithm:**
   - Use the ""slow and fast pointer"" technique to find the middle element of the linked list.
   - Recursively construct the BST by making the middle element the root and then constructing the left and right subtrees from the left and right halves of the linked list.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Empty linked list: Return None.
   - Single element: Return a tree with that single node.
   - Two elements: One as root and the other as either left or right child, depending on the value.

2. If either left or right child is null, we return the depth of the other child + 1.
3. If both children are non-null, we take the minimum depth of both children and add 1.

To handle all the cases in a single line, we use a ternary conditional expression in C++, Java, and JavaScript, and use the `and`-`or` short-circuit syntax in Python. We check if either left or right is 0, and in that case return left + right + 1 which handles cases 1 and 2; otherwise, we return the minimum depth of both children + 1, which handles case 3.
    ","Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node. A leaf node is a node with no children.

To solve this, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. BFS is well-suited for this problem because it explores the tree level by level, starting from the root. The first leaf node we encounter during the BFS traversal will be at the minimum depth.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Handle the base case:** If the tree is empty (i.e., the root is `None`), the minimum depth is 0.
2. **Use a queue for BFS:** We'll use a queue to keep track of the nodes at each level.
3. **Initialize the depth:** Start with a depth of 1 since the root node is at depth 1.
4. **BFS traversal:**
   - Dequeue a node from the queue.
   - Check if it's a leaf node (both left and right children are `None`). If it is, return the current depth.
   - Enqueue its non-null children.
   - Increment the depth after processing all nodes at the current level.

So, we have a binary tree, and we need to find all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values equals a given target sum. We should return these paths as lists of node values.

First, I need to understand the structure of a binary tree. Each node has a value and can have up to two children, left and right. A leaf node is one that has no children.

To solve this, I think I need to traverse the tree from the root to each leaf, keeping track of the path and the sum of the values along that path. When I reach a leaf node, I can check if the path sum equals the target sum. If it does, I'll add that path to my result list.

I believe a depth-first search (DFS) approach would be suitable here, as it allows me to explore each path fully before backtracking.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Start at the root with an empty path and a sum of zero.

2. Add the current node's value to the path and update the current sum.

3. If the current node is a leaf and the current sum equals the target sum, add the path to the result list.

4. If the current node is not a leaf, recursively apply the same process to its left and right children.

5. Backtrack by removing the current node's value from the path and subtracting it from the current sum before returning from the recursion.

I need to make sure that the path list is passed down through the recursion without being recreated at each step, to preserve the path for each branch.

Also, since the problem specifies to return lists of node values and not node references, I need to collect the values in the path.

Let me consider how to implement this in Python. I'll need to define a helper function that performs the DFS.

Here's a rough sketch:","python

So, the task is to take the root of a binary tree and flatten it into a linked list using the same TreeNode class, where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list, and the left child pointer is always null. The order should be the same as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.

First, let's make sure we understand what a binary tree and a pre-order traversal are. A binary tree is a data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Pre-order traversal is a way to visit all the nodes of a tree, where you visit the current node before its children. The order is: root, left subtree, then right subtree.

So, in this problem, we need to rearrange the tree so that it becomes a linked list where each node only has a right child, and the left child is always null. The sequence of nodes in this linked list should match the pre-order traversal of the original tree.

Given that the tree is perfect, every level is fully filled, and all leaves are at the same level. This property allows us to connect nodes level by level without needing extra space for tracking nodes.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**: Start with the root node. If the root is `None`, return immediately.
2. **Connect Nodes Level by Level**:
    - Use the `next` pointers to traverse the tree level by level.
    - For each level, set the `next` pointers for the child nodes.
    - Start from the root and iteratively set the `next` pointers for the left and right children of each node.
3. **Traversal**:
    - Use a pointer `current` to traverse the nodes at the current level.
    - Use another pointer `level_start` to keep track of the start of the next level.
    - Connect the left and right children of each node and link the right child to the left child of the next node if it exists.

    The basic idea of the algorithm is to perform level-order traversal (Breadth First Search) on the binary tree. We use a queue to store the nodes in each level. For each level, we iterate through its nodes, update the `next` pointer, and add their children to the end of the queue. The `prev` variable holds the previous node in the current level. The `next` pointer of the `prev` node is updated to the current node. The variable `prev` is then set to the current node. Repeat this process until the queue is empty which means we have visited all the nodes in the tree.
    ","Given a binary tree

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node \*left;
  Node \*right;
  Node \*next;
}

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3,4,5,null,7\]
**Output:** \[1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#\]
**Explanation:** Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.

If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL. Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a binary tree where each node has a `next` pointer in addition to the left and right child pointers.
   - We need to connect these `next` pointers so that each node points to its immediate right neighbor on the same level.
   - The tree is not necessarily a perfect binary tree, meaning some nodes might be missing.

2. **Level Order Traversal:**
   - A straightforward way to solve this is to perform a level order traversal (BFS) and connect the nodes level by level.
   - However, the follow-up constraints suggest using constant extra space, which means we should avoid using a queue for BFS as it would require O(n) space.

3. **Using Next Pointers:**
   - We can use the `next` pointers themselves to traverse the tree level by level without using extra space.
   - We'll maintain a pointer to the leftmost node of each level and use the `next` pointers to connect the nodes on the next level.

4. **Algorithm Steps:**
   - Start with the root node.
   - While traversing the current level, use the `next` pointers to connect the nodes on the next level.
   - Move to the next level by shifting the current level pointer to the leftmost node of the next level.

The problem is about finding the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling a stock given an array of daily prices. I need to buy on one day and sell on a different day in the future, meaning the selling day must come after the buying day.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have an array where each element represents the price of the stock on that day. I need to choose two days: one for buying and one for selling, with the selling day being after the buying day, such that the difference between the selling price and the buying price is maximized.

Looking at the first example:

prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]

The best time to buy is on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), which gives a profit of 5.

In the second example:

prices = [7,6,4,3,1]

There is no way to make a profit because the prices are decreasing every day, so the maximum profit is 0.

Constraints:

- The length of the prices array can be up to 10^5, which is 100,000 days.

- Each price is between 0 and 10^4, inclusive.

Given the large size of the array, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) time complexity, because anything higher, like O(n^2), would be too slow for n=100,000.

I recall that a common approach to this problem is to iterate through the array while keeping track of the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit that can be achieved.

Here's a plan:

1. Initialize two variables: min_price to infinity (or a very high value) and max_profit to 0.

2. Iterate through the array from left to right:

a. For each day's price, check if it's lower than min_price. If yes, update min_price to this price.

b. Otherwise, calculate the profit if selling on this day (current price - min_price). If this profit is greater than max_profit, update max_profit.

3. After iterating through the array, return max_profit.

This approach ensures that we always have the lowest price seen so far and the maximum profit that can be achieved by selling on the current day.

Let me test this logic with the first example:

prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]

- Day 1: price=7

- min_price = 7

- max_profit = 0

- Day 2: price=1

- 1 < 7, so min_price = 1

- Day 3: price=5

- 5 - 1 = 4 > 0, so max_profit = 4

- Day 4: price=3

- 3 - 1 = 2 < 4, so max_profit remains 4

- Day 5: price=6

- 6 - 1 = 5 > 4, so max_profit = 5

- Day 6: price=4

- 4 - 1 = 3 < 5, so max_profit remains 5

Final max_profit = 5, which matches the expected output.

Now, the second example:

prices = [7,6,4,3,1]

- Day 1: price=7

- min_price = 7

- max_profit = 0

- Day 2: price=6

- 6 < 7, so min_price = 6

- Day 3: price=4

- 4 < 6, so min_price = 4

- Day 4: price=3

- 3 < 4, so min_price = 3

- Day 5: price=1

- 1 < 3, so min_price = 1

No profit greater than 0 is ever found, so max_profit remains 0, which is correct.

This seems to work well. Now, considering the constraints, with n up to 100,000, this approach runs in O(n) time, which should be efficient enough.

I should also consider edge cases:

- If the array has only one day, we cannot make any transaction, so return 0.

- If the array is empty, but according to constraints, n >= 1, so no need to handle empty arrays.

- If all prices are the same, the max_profit remains 0.

- If the prices are in increasing order, the max_profit is the difference between the last and first price.

- If the prices are in decreasing order, the max_profit remains 0.

I should also consider the minimum and maximum values:

- Prices can be 0, so negative profits don't make sense; we only consider non-negative profits.

- Prices can be up to 10^4, so the maximum profit can be up to 10^4.

In terms of implementation, I need to choose appropriate data types, but in Python, integers can be of arbitrary size, so no issues there.

Let me try to write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from buying and selling a stock given the daily prices. We are required to choose one day to buy and a different day in the future to sell the stock.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Set `min_price` to a very high value initially.
   - Set `max_profit` to 0.

2. **Iterate Through Prices**:
   - For each day's price in the array:
     - If the price is lower than `min_price`, update `min_price`.
     - Otherwise, calculate the profit if selling on this day (current price - `min_price`).
     - If this profit is greater than `max_profit`, update `max_profit`.

3. **Return the Maximum Profit**:
   - After iterating through the array, return the `max_profit`.

This approach ensures that we always track the lowest price seen so far and the maximum profit that can be achieved by selling on the current day.

So, I have an array of stock prices where each element represents the price of the stock on a particular day. I can buy and sell the stock multiple times, but I can only hold at most one share at a time. That means I can't have multiple stocks at the same time, but I can buy and sell on the same day if it benefits me.

The goal is to find the maximum profit I can achieve.

Let me look at the examples to understand better.

In Example 1:

prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]

The solution says to buy on day 2 (price = 1), sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 4.

Then buy on day 4 (price = 3), sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 3.

Total profit is 7.

In Example 2:

prices = [1,2,3,4,5]

Buy on day 1 (price = 1), sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 4.

In Example 3:

prices = [7,6,4,3,1]

No positive profit can be made, so the profit is 0.

From these examples, it seems like the strategy is to buy before the prices go up and sell before they go down.

I need to find a way to capture all the increasing sequences in the price array.

Wait, in the first example, buying on day 2 and selling on day 3, then buying on day 4 and selling on day 5 captures all the increasing parts.

In the second example, it's a straight increasing line, so buying at the start and selling at the end is fine.

In the third example, the prices are decreasing, so no profit can be made.

So, a general strategy could be to look for all the increasing subsequences and sum up their differences.

But I need to think about how to implement this efficiently, especially since the constraints allow prices.length up to 3 * 10^4, which means I need an O(n) solution.

Let me think about it differently. If I look at consecutive days, and whenever the price increases from one day to the next, I can consider buying on the cheaper day and selling on the more expensive day.

For example, in [7,1,5,3,6,4]:

- Day 1 to Day 2: 7 to 1 → decrease, no profit.

- Day 2 to Day 3: 1 to 5 → increase, profit of 4.

- Day 3 to Day 4: 5 to 3 → decrease, no profit.

- Day 4 to Day 5: 3 to 6 → increase, profit of 3.

- Day 5 to Day 6: 6 to 4 → decrease, no profit.

Total profit: 4 + 3 = 7.

That matches the first example.

In the second example: [1,2,3,4,5]

- Day 1 to Day 2: 1 to 2 → profit of 1.

- Day 2 to Day 3: 2 to 3 → profit of 1.

- Day 3 to Day 4: 3 to 4 → profit of 1.

- Day 4 to Day 5: 4 to 5 → profit of 1.

Total profit: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.

Again, matches the example.

In the third example: [7,6,4,3,1]

- All consecutive days show decreases, so no profit.

Total profit: 0.

Perfect, this seems to work.

So, the strategy is to sum up the differences of all consecutive days where the price increases.

This is a simple O(n) solution, as I just need to iterate through the array once and add up the increases.

Let me try to write this in code.

Initialize profit to 0.

For each i from 1 to len(prices) - 1:

if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:

profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]

Return profit.

That seems too straightforward. Is there any edge case where this might not work?

Let me think about a plateau, where prices stay the same for several days.

For example, prices = [1,1,1,1]

According to my strategy:

- Day 1 to Day 2: 1 to 1 → no profit.

- Day 2 to Day 3: 1 to 1 → no profit.

- Day 3 to Day 4: 1 to 1 → no profit.

Total profit: 0.

Which is correct, as there is no increase.

Another case: prices = [1,2,1,2,1,2]

- Day 1 to Day 2: 1 to 2 → profit of 1.

- Day 2 to Day 3: 2 to 1 → no profit.

- Day 3 to Day 4: 1 to 2 → profit of 1.

- Day 4 to Day 5: 2 to 1 → no profit.

- Day 5 to Day 6: 1 to 2 → profit of 1.

Total profit: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Is there a better way? If I try to buy on day 1 and sell on day 2 (profit 1), buy on day 3 and sell on day 4 (profit 1), and buy on day 5 and sell on day 6 (profit 1), total is 3.

Alternatively, if I try to hold longer, like buy on day 1 and sell on day 6, profit would be 1, which is less than 3.

So, my strategy works better.

Another edge case: only one day.

prices = [1]

Since I can't sell on the same day, profit is 0.

Wait, according to the constraints, 1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10^4, so minimum is 1 day.

In my code, the loop starts from i=1 to len(prices)-1, so for len=1, it won't enter the loop and profit remains 0.

Correct.

Another edge case: prices = [1,100]

Buy on day 1, sell on day 2, profit 99.

According to my code:

i=1, prices[1]=100 > prices[0]=1 → profit += 99.

Total profit: 99.

Correct.

I think this strategy covers all cases.

Let me see if there's a way to make it more efficient or if there's a mistake somewhere.

Since it's O(n) and straightforward, and I've tested it with the examples and some edge cases, I think it should be fine.

I can proceed to implement this in Python.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from buying and selling stocks given the daily prices, with the flexibility to perform multiple transactions (buy and sell on the same day is allowed, but only holding at most one share at a time).

### Approach
1. **Intuition**: The key is to capture every possible price increase between consecutive days.
2. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize a variable `profit` to zero.
   - Iterate through the array of prices starting from the second day to the last day.
   - For each day, check if the price is higher than the previous day.
   - If it is, add the difference to the `profit`.
3. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n) because we make a single pass through the array.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we only use a few variables for computation.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We will track four variables:
     - `buy1`: The cost of the first buy transaction.
     - `sell1`: The profit after the first sell transaction.
     - `buy2`: The cost of the second buy transaction.
     - `sell2`: The profit after the second sell transaction.
   - Initialize `buy1` and `buy2` to a large negative value (to handle the first purchase correctly), and `sell1` and `sell2` to 0.

2. **Iterate through the prices**:
   - For each price in the array, update the variables as follows:
     - Update `buy1` to be the minimum of its current value and the negative of the current price (since buying costs money).
     - Update `sell1` to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `buy1` and the current price (profit from first sell).
     - Update `buy2` to be the maximum of its current value and the difference between `sell1` and the current price (cost of second buy).
     - Update `sell2` to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `buy2` and the current price (profit from second sell).

3. **Result**:
   - The maximum profit after at most two transactions is stored in `sell2`.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to consider all possible paths in the tree, not necessarily those passing through the root.
   - The path can start and end at any node.
   - Nodes can have negative values, so we need to handle cases where including a subtree might decrease the total sum.

2. **Key Insights:**
   - For any node, the maximum path sum that includes that node can be calculated using the maximum path sums of its left and right subtrees.
   - We need to keep track of the global maximum path sum while recursively computing the maximum path sum starting from each node.

3. **Recursive Function:**
   - Define a recursive function that computes the maximum path sum starting from a given node.
   - This function should return the maximum sum of the path that starts at the current node and goes down to one of its descendants.
   - During this computation, calculate the maximum path sum that passes through the current node by considering the sums from both its left and right subtrees.

4. **Handling Negative Sums:**
   - If the sum from a subtree is negative, it is better not to include that subtree in the path, as it would only decrease the total sum.
   - Therefore, we take the maximum of the sum from a subtree or zero.

Additionally, the sky was clear that day.","To solve this problem, we need to find all the shortest transformation sequences from `beginWord` to `endWord` using the words in `wordList`, where each transformation changes only one letter at a time and each intermediate word must be in `wordList`.

### Approach

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - We can model this problem as a graph traversal problem where each word is a node, and there is an edge between two nodes if they differ by only one letter.
   - To efficiently find words that differ by one letter, we can use a hash map to group words by their patterns. For example, for the word ""hit"", patterns would be ""*it"", ""h*t"", ""hi*"".

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - BFS is ideal for finding the shortest paths in an unweighted graph.
   - We'll perform a BFS from `beginWord` to `endWord`, keeping track of the level (or depth) of each word in the transformation sequence.
   - We need to keep track of the parent relationships to reconstruct the paths later.

3. **Tracking Parents**:
   - During BFS, we maintain a dictionary to track which words can lead to the current word in the shortest path.
   - This helps in reconstructing all possible shortest paths from `beginWord` to `endWord`.

4. **Reconstructing Paths**:
   - Once BFS is complete, we can use the parent relationships to build all shortest paths from `beginWord` to `endWord`.

I have a starting word, an ending word, and a list of words I can use to transform from the start to the end. The goal is to find the shortest sequence of transformations where each step changes only one letter, and each intermediate word is in the given list.

Let me try to understand this with the example provided:

beginWord = ""hit""

endWord = ""cog""

wordList = [""hot"", ""dot"", ""dog"", ""lot"", ""log"", ""cog""]

The expected output is 5, which corresponds to the sequence: ""hit"" -> ""hot"" -> ""dot"" -> ""dog"" -> ""cog"".

Okay, so I need to find the shortest path from ""hit"" to ""cog"" by changing one letter at a time, and each intermediate word must be in the wordList.

First, I need to think about how to model this problem. It seems like a graph problem where each word is a node, and there's an edge between two nodes if they differ by exactly one letter.

So, I can build a graph where each word is connected to other words that are one letter apart from it.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path in this graph from the beginWord to the endWord.

To find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, I can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).

But building the entire graph upfront might be inefficient, especially since the wordList can be large (up to 5000 words), and each word is up to 10 letters long.

Is there a smarter way to build the graph on the fly while performing BFS?

Yes, instead of prebuilding the graph, I can generate the neighbors of a word on the fly by trying all possible one-letter mutations of the word and checking if the mutated word is in the wordList.

This way, I don't need to store the entire graph in memory, which should save space.

Let me think about how to implement this.

I'll need a queue to perform BFS.

I'll start by enqueueing the beginWord and setting the step count to 1.

Then, while the queue is not empty, I'll dequeue a word, and generate all possible mutations by changing one letter at a time.

For each mutation, I'll check if it's in the wordList and hasn't been visited yet.

If it is in the list and hasn't been visited, I'll enqueue it and mark it as visited.

I'll keep track of the step count as I go deeper into the BFS.

If I reach the endWord, I'll return the step count.

If I exhaust all possibilities without reaching the endWord, I'll return 0.

This seems straightforward. But I need to make sure that this approach is efficient enough, considering the constraints.

With wordList up to 5000 words and each word up to 10 letters, generating all possible mutations for each word could be time-consuming.

Wait, for each word, there are 26 possibilities for each letter position, and with word length up to 10, that's 26 * 10 = 260 mutations per word.

But since the wordList is up to 5000 words, in the worst case, the BFS could visit all 5000 words.

So the total number of operations could be around 5000 * 260 = 1.3 million operations.

That should be acceptable for a programming problem, as it's not too large.

But I need to optimize the implementation to make sure it runs efficiently.

One optimization is to represent the wordList as a set for O(1) lookups.

Also, I need to keep track of visited words to avoid processing the same word multiple times.

I can use a set to keep track of visited words.

Wait, actually, since I'm doing BFS, I can use a queue and a visited set to ensure each word is processed only once.

Also, to speed up the mutation generation, I can precompute some patterns.

But maybe that's overkill for now.

Let me try to outline the steps again:

1. Check if the endWord is in the wordList. If not, return 0 immediately.

2. Initialize a queue and enqueue the beginWord with step count 1.

3. Initialize a visited set to keep track of processed words.

4. While the queue is not empty:

a. Dequeue a word and its step count.

b. If this word is the endWord, return the step count.

c. Generate all possible one-letter mutations of this word.

d. For each mutation, if it's in the wordList and not visited:

i. Enqueue it with step count + 1.

ii. Mark it as visited.

5. If the loop ends without finding the endWord, return 0.

This seems correct.

Let me think about the mutation generation.

For a word like ""hit"", the possible mutations are:

- Change first letter: from 'h' to 'a' to 'z', except 'h' itself.

So ""ait"", ""bit"", ""cit"",..., ""zit""

- Change second letter: ""hat"", ""het"", ""hgt"", etc.

- Change third letter: ""hia"", ""hib"", ""hic"",..., ""hiz""

I need to generate all these possibilities and check if they are in the wordList.

This seems manageable.

But perhaps there's a smarter way to generate mutations.

Alternatively, I can consider a wildcard pattern where one letter is replaced by a wildcard character, and group words that match the same pattern.

For example, for ""hit"":

- *it (matches words like ""bit"", ""fit"", ""git"", etc.)

- h*t (matches ""hat"", ""het"", ""hts"", etc.)

- hi* (matches ""hib"", ""hic"", ""hid"", etc.)

By pregrouping words into these patterns, I can quickly find neighbors for each word.

This might speed up the process, especially if I build these groups beforehand.

But building these groups for the entire wordList might take extra time and space.

Given the time constraints, perhaps it's better to generate mutations on the fly for simplicity.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider bidirectional BFS, starting from both the beginWord and the endWord and meeting in the middle.

This could potentially reduce the search space, but it also complicates the implementation.

For now, I'll stick with simple BFS from beginWord.

I need to make sure that the implementation is efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the input constraints.

Another thing to consider is that the beginWord might not be in the wordList, but words in the list can be used for transformations.

Also, all words in the wordList are unique.

Let me consider edge cases:

- If beginWord is the same as endWord, but beginWord is not in the wordList, is it allowed? According to the constraints, beginWord!= endWord, so this is not possible.

- If beginWord is in the wordList, should it be considered part of the transformations? The problem says beginWord does not need to be in the wordList, but its transformations must be in the list.

- If there are multiple paths with the same length, any one of them is acceptable, since we just need the length.

- If there are no transformations possible, return 0.

I need to make sure that the implementation handles these cases correctly.

Let me try to write a pseudocode for this:","function ladderLength(beginWord, endWord, wordList):

    longest_seq = 0

    for num in nums:
        if num - 1 not in elements:

            current_seq = 1

            longest_seq = max(longest_seq, current_seq)
    
    return longest_seq
```
    
    The algorithm first creates a set (or hash set) with the given array of integers called `elements`. The set will allow us to have a fast O(1) lookup on our next step.
Now we iterate through the original array of numbers, and for each number, we check if `(number - 1)` is not in the `elements` set. If it's not in the set, it means we can start counting a new consecutive sequence.
Next, we create two variables, `currentNum` and `currentSeq`, and initialize them with the current number and 1, respectively.
We then use a while loop to check if the next number (`currentNum + 1`) is in the `elements` set. If it is, we increment both `currentNum` and `currentSeq`. This process will continue, finding consecutive elements in the set, until no more consecutive elements are found.
Finally, to get the length of the longest consecutive sequence, we update the `longestSeq` variable by choosing the maximum value between itself and `currentSeq`. This will keep track of the longest consecutive sequence found so far.

The challenge is to do this in O(n) time complexity. Let's break down the problem and think about how we can achieve this.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array of integers, which may contain duplicates and is not sorted.
   - We need to find the length of the longest sequence of consecutive numbers.

2. **Initial Thoughts:**
   - Sorting the array would make it easy to find consecutive sequences, but sorting would take O(n log n) time, which is not acceptable.
   - We need a way to process the array in linear time.

3. **Using a HashSet:**
   - Insert all elements into a HashSet for O(1) lookups.
   - For each number, check if it's the start of a sequence (i.e., no smaller neighbor exists).
   - If it is, iterate forward to find the length of the sequence.

4. **Algorithm Steps:**
   - Create a HashSet and add all elements from the array.
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the longest sequence length.
   - Iterate through each number in the array:
     - If the number is the start of a sequence (num - 1 not in the set), then:
       - Initialize a counter to 1.
       - While the next number (num + 1) exists in the set, increment the counter and move to the next number.
       - Update the longest sequence length if the current sequence is longer.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Empty array: return 0.
   - Array with one element: return 1.
   - Array with all elements the same: return 1.
   - Array with no consecutive numbers: return 1.
   - Array with multiple consecutive sequences: return the length of the longest one.

So, the problem is about a binary tree where each node contains a digit from 0 to 9. We need to find the sum of all root-to-leaf paths, where each path represents a number.

For example, in the first example, the paths are 1->2 and 1->3, representing the numbers 12 and 13, and their sum is 25.

In the second example, the paths are 4->9->5 (495), 4->9->1 (491), and 4->0 (40), and their sum is 1026.

Alright, so the main task is to traverse from the root to each leaf, keeping track of the number formed by the path, and then sum all those numbers.

First, I need to recall what a binary tree is and how to traverse it. A binary tree is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

A leaf node is a node that has no children.

So, to solve this problem, I need to perform a root-to-leaf traversal, also known as a depth-first traversal.

In a depth-first traversal, we go as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.

In this case, we'll start from the root, and for each step, we'll append the current node's value to the path number, and when we reach a leaf node, we'll add that path number to the total sum.

I need to make sure that the path number is correctly formed by concatenating the digits from root to leaf.

For example, in the path 1->2->3, the number is 123, not 6 or something else.

So, to form the number, I need to consider the path as a sequence of digits, where each digit is a node's value.

One way to do this is to keep a running number as we traverse down the tree.

For instance, starting from the root with value 1, the running number is 1.

Then, moving to its left child with value 2, the running number becomes 1*10 + 2 = 12.

Then, moving to its left child (if any), we'd do 12*10 + child_value.

But in this case, 1->2 is a leaf, so we stop at 12.

Similarly, for 1->3, it's another leaf, so we have 1*10 + 3 = 13.

Then, sum 12 + 13 = 25.

That makes sense.

So, the general approach is:

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the current path number.

2. Traverse the tree recursively, starting from the root.

3. At each node, update the current path number by multiplying the current path number by 10 and adding the node's value.

4. If the current node is a leaf (has no children), add the current path number to the total sum.

5. If the current node has left and/or right children, recursively call the function on those children with the updated path number.

6. After traversing all paths, return the total sum.

I need to make sure that this approach handles the edge cases correctly.

For example, if the tree has only one node, say 0, then the sum should be 0.

If the tree has multiple levels, like in the second example, I need to ensure that the path numbers are correctly formed for each leaf.

Also, the problem states that the tree depth won't exceed 10, and the sum will fit into a 32-bit integer, so I don't need to worry about integer overflow in Python.

Python's integers can handle arbitrary sizes, so that's fine.

Now, I need to think about how to implement this recursively.

I'll need a helper function that takes the current node and the current path number as parameters.

Initially, the helper function is called with the root and 0 as the path number.

At each step:

- If the node is None, return 0 (base case).

- Update the path number by multiplying by 10 and adding the node's value.

- If the node is a leaf (no left and right children), return the current path number.

- Otherwise, recursively call the helper function on the left and right children, and sum their returns.

- Return the sum of the recursive calls.

This seems straightforward.

Let me try to write a pseudocode for this:","def sumNumbers(root):

def helper(node, current_number):

if not node:

return 0

current_number = current_number * 10 + node.val

if not node.left and not node.right:

return current_number

return helper(node.left, current_number) + helper(node.right, current_number)

return helper(root, 0)","**Correctness:** correct

Each node in the graph has an integer value and a list of its neighbors, which are also nodes. The graph is connected, meaning there's a path from any node to any other node.

First, I need to understand what a deep copy means in this context. A deep copy means that I need to create entirely new nodes for the cloned graph, and these new nodes should have the same values and connections as the original nodes, but they should be separate objects. So, changing the cloned graph shouldn't affect the original graph, and vice versa.

Given that the graph is connected and undirected, and that each node has a unique integer value, I can probably use these unique values to keep track of which nodes have been cloned already.

I should think about how to traverse the graph to visit all nodes. Since it's connected, I can start from the given node and use either BFS (Breadth-First Search) or DFS (Depth-First Search) to visit all nodes.

I need to keep track of which nodes have already been cloned to avoid infinite loops, especially since the graph is undirected and connected, meaning there are no isolated subgraphs.

Let me consider using a dictionary to map original nodes to their clones. This way, whenever I clone a node, I can store it in the dictionary with the original node as the key. Then, when I encounter a neighbor that has already been cloned, I can simply retrieve it from the dictionary instead of cloning it again.

So, the steps might look like this:

1. Create a function to clone a node.

2. In this function, check if the node has already been cloned by looking it up in the dictionary.

3. If it has, return the clone from the dictionary.

4. If not, create a new node with the same value, add it to the dictionary, and then clone its neighbors.

5. To clone the neighbors, iterate through the original node's neighbors, recursively call the clone function on each, and add the returned clones to the new node's neighbors list.

I need to make sure that I don't end up with cycles that cause infinite recursion. That's why the dictionary is important; it helps track which nodes have already been cloned.

Let me think about the base case. The base case would be when a node has no neighbors, which is possible since the graph could have nodes with no connections, but in this problem, it's stated that the graph is connected, so every node should have at least one neighbor, except perhaps for a graph with only one node.

Wait, no, in a connected graph, even a single node should be considered as having no neighbors, which is fine.

I should also consider the case where the input is an empty graph, meaning no nodes at all. In that case, the function should just return None or an empty list, but according to the problem statement, the graph has at least one node because the given node is always the first node with val = 1.

Wait, no, looking back at the problem statement, in Example 3, adjList = [], which represents an empty graph, and the output is []. So, I need to handle the case where there are no nodes.

Also, in Example 2, adjList = [[]], which represents a single node with no neighbors.

So, I need to handle both cases: no nodes and a single node with no neighbors.

Let me try to outline the function structure.

I'll need a class for the Node, as defined:

class Node:

def __init__(self, val=0, neighbors=None):

self.val = val

self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []

Then, the main function will take the input node and return its clone.

I'll need to use a dictionary to keep track of cloned nodes, with original nodes as keys and their clones as values.

Let me sketch a rough version of the function:

def cloneGraph(node):

if not node:

return None

# Create a dictionary to store cloned nodes

cloned = {}

return cloneNode(node, cloned)

def cloneNode(node, cloned):

# If the node is already cloned, return its clone

if node in cloned:

return cloned[node]

# Create a new node with the same value

new_node = Node(node.val)

# Add it to the cloned dictionary

cloned[node] = new_node

# Clone its neighbors

new_node.neighbors = [cloneNode(neighbor, cloned) for neighbor in node.neighbors]

return new_node

Wait, but this seems a bit redundant. I can probably do this without a separate cloneNode function, but I'll keep it for clarity.

I need to make sure that I don't run into infinite recursion. Since the graph is undirected and connected, I need to ensure that once a node is cloned, it's stored in the dictionary, and any further references to it will return the same clone.

Let me think about how this works with the example.

Take Example 1:

adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]

This represents:

Node 1 neighbors: 2 and 4

Node 2 neighbors: 1 and 3

Node 3 neighbors: 2 and 4

Node 4 neighbors: 1 and 3

So, starting from node 1:

- Clone node 1, create a new node with val=1

- Clone its neighbors 2 and 4

- To clone node 2:

- Create a new node with val=2

- Clone its neighbors 1 and 3

- Node 1 has already been cloned, so return the clone from the dictionary

- Clone node 3:

- Create a new node with val=3

- Clone its neighbors 2 and 4

- Node 2 has already been cloned, return its clone

- Clone node 4:

- Create a new node with val=4

- Clone its neighbors 1 and 3

- Both have already been cloned

- Finally, all clones are connected appropriately

This seems straightforward.

I need to make sure that the clones' neighbors lists contain the clones of the original neighbors, not the original neighbors themselves.

Also, I need to ensure that the clones are distinct objects. For example, the clone of node 1 should have its neighbors as the clones of node 2 and 4, not the original node 2 and 4.

Now, considering the constraints:

- Number of nodes is between 0 and 100

- Node values are between 1 and 100

- Node values are unique

- No repeated edges or self-loops

- Graph is connected

Given that node values are unique and range from 1 to 100, I could potentially use the value as a key in the dictionary, but since the problem states that nodes are objects with integer values, it's safer to use the nodes themselves as keys.

I should not assume that node values are unique across different graphs, only within the same graph.

Wait, but the problem says ""Node.val is unique for each node."" within the same graph.

So, in the same graph, node values are unique.

But since I'm cloning the graph, the cloned graph will have nodes with the same values, but they are different objects.

Hence, using the original nodes as keys in the dictionary is the way to go.

Now, considering the time complexity.

Since I need to visit each node once and each edge once, the time complexity should be O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges.

Space complexity would be O(V), due to the dictionary storing clones of each node.

Given that the number of nodes is up to 100, this should be efficient enough.

Let me think about potential edge cases:

1. Empty graph: adjList = []

- Should return []

2. Single node with no neighbors: adjList = [[]]

- Should return a single node with no neighbors

3. Graph with cycles

- The dictionary should prevent infinite recursion by returning already cloned nodes

4. Graph with two nodes pointing to each other

- Similarly, the dictionary should handle this without issues

5. Large graph with 100 nodes and maximum connections

- Should still perform within acceptable time limits, given the constraints

I need to make sure that the function can handle all these cases correctly.

Let me try to write some pseudocode to visualize this.

Define Node class as above.

Define cloneGraph function:

if node is None:

return None

Create a dictionary cloned = {}

Define a function cloneNode(node, cloned):

if node in cloned:

return cloned[node]

new_node = Node(node.val)

cloned[node] = new_node

new_node.neighbors = [cloneNode(neighbor, cloned) for neighbor in node.neighbors]

return new_node

return cloneNode(node, cloned)

This seems concise and should work.

Let me test this pseudocode with Example 1.

Given adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]

Starting with node 1:

- Clone node 1, create new_node1 with val=1

- cloned = {node1: new_node1}

- Clone neighbors 2 and 4

- Clone node 2:

- Create new_node2 with val=2

- cloned = {node1: new_node1, node2: new_node2}

- Clone neighbors 1 and 3

- Node 1 is already in cloned, so return new_node1

- Clone node 3:

- Create new_node3 with val=3

- cloned = {node1: new_node1, node2: new_node2, node3: new_node3}

- Clone neighbors 2 and 4

- Node 2 is already cloned, return new_node2

- Clone node 4:

- Create new_node4 with val=4

- cloned = {node1: new_node1, node2: new_node2, node3: new_node3, node4: new_node4}

- Clone neighbors 1 and 3

- Node 1 and node 3 are already cloned, return new_node1 and new_node3

- Now, all clones are created and connected correctly

Seems good.

Now, for the empty graph:

adjList = []

- Return None

For a single node with no neighbors:

adjList = [[]]

- Clone node 1 with no neighbors

- Return new_node1

Good.

I think this approach should work.

But, I need to implement this in Python, and make sure that the Node class is defined properly.

Also, I need to make sure that the function signature matches what's expected.

Given that, I can proceed to write the actual code.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to create a deep copy of a given undirected graph. Each node in the graph has a value and a list of its neighbors. We must ensure that the cloned graph is a separate deep copy, meaning changes in the cloned graph do not affect the original graph, and vice versa.

### Approach
1. **Tracking Cloned Nodes:** Use a dictionary to track cloned nodes, with original nodes as keys and their corresponding clones as values.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Implement a recursive DFS approach to traverse the graph, cloning nodes and their neighbors.
3. **Base Case Handling:** Handle cases where the graph is empty or consists of a single node with no neighbors.

The key here is to make sure that we create new nodes for each node in the original list and correctly set their `next` and `random` pointers to point to the corresponding new nodes, not the original ones.

First, I need to understand the structure of the nodes in this linked list. Each node has at least two pointers: `next` and `random`. The `next` pointer points to the next node in the list, while the `random` pointer can point to any node in the list or `null`.

The challenge is that we need to create a copy of this list without altering the original one, and ensure that the new list is entirely made up of new nodes.

One straightforward way to approach this is to use a hash map to keep track of the mapping between original nodes and their corresponding new nodes. This way, when we need to set the `next` or `random` pointer of a new node, we can look up the corresponding new node in the hash map.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Create a mapping of original nodes to new nodes:**
   - Traverse the original linked list.
   - For each node, create a new node with the same value and store it in a hash map with the original node as the key.

2. **Set the `next` and `random` pointers for the new nodes:**
   - Traverse the original linked list again.
   - For each original node, set the `next` and `random` pointers of the corresponding new node using the hash map.

3. **Return the head of the new list:**
   - The head of the new list is the value associated with the original head in the hash map.

This approach ensures that we don't modify the original list and that all pointers in the new list are correctly set to point to other new nodes.

Let's consider the first example to illustrate this:

Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

This represents a list with 5 nodes:

- Node 0: value = 7, random = null
- Node 1: value = 13, random = Node 0
- Node 2: value = 11, random = Node 4
- Node 3: value = 10, random = Node 2
- Node 4: value = 1, random = Node 0

Using the hash map approach:

1. Create new nodes for each original node and store them in the hash map:

   - original_node_0 -> new_node_0
   - original_node_1 -> new_node_1
   - original_node_2 -> new_node_2
   - original_node_3 -> new_node_3
   - original_node_4 -> new_node_4

2. Set the `next` and `random` pointers:

   - new_node_0.next = new_node_1
   - new_node_0.random = null
   - new_node_1.next = new_node_2
   - new_node_1.random = new_node_0
   - new_node_2.next = new_node_3
   - new_node_2.random = new_node_4
   - new_node_3.next = new_node_4
   - new_node_3.random = new_node_2
   - new_node_4.next = null
   - new_node_4.random = new_node_0

3. The head of the new list is new_node_0.

This should produce the correct deep copy of the original list.

Now, let's think about the time and space complexity.

- Time Complexity: O(N) - We traverse the list twice: once to create the new nodes and once to set the pointers.
- Space Complexity: O(N) - We use a hash map to store the mapping between original and new nodes.

Is there a way to reduce the space complexity? Let's think about it.

An alternative approach is to weave the new nodes into the original list, which allows us to avoid using extra space for the hash map.

Here's how it can be done:

1. **Create new nodes and insert them into the original list:**
   - For each node in the original list, create a new node with the same value and insert it immediately after the original node.
   - For example, original list: A -> B -> C
   - After insertion: A -> A' -> B -> B' -> C -> C'

2. **Set the `random` pointers for the new nodes:**
   - Since the new nodes are directly after their corresponding original nodes, we can easily set the `random` pointers.
   - For each original node, if it has a `random` pointer to some node X, then its corresponding new node should have its `random` pointer set to X's corresponding new node, which is immediately after X.

3. **Separate the new list from the original list:**
   - Traverse the combined list and separate it into two lists: the original list and the new list.

This approach modifies the original list during the process but restores it afterward.

Let's apply this to the first example:

Original list:

Node 0 -> Node 1 -> Node 2 -> Node 3 -> Node 4

After inserting new nodes:

Node 0 -> new_node_0 -> Node 1 -> new_node_1 -> Node 2 -> new_node_2 -> Node 3 -> new_node_3 -> Node 4 -> new_node_4

Now, set the `random` pointers for new nodes:

- new_node_0.random = null (since Node 0.random = null)
- new_node_1.random = new_node_0 (since Node 1.random = Node 0)
- new_node_2.random = new_node_4 (since Node 2.random = Node 4)
- new_node_3.random = new_node_2 (since Node 3.random = Node 2)
- new_node_4.random = new_node_0 (since Node 4.random = Node 0)

Finally, separate the lists:

- Original list: Node 0 -> Node 1 -> Node 2 -> Node 3 -> Node 4
- New list: new_node_0 -> new_node_1 -> new_node_2 -> new_node_3 -> new_node_4

This approach also achieves O(N) time complexity but with O(1) additional space, since we're not using a hash map.

However, it modifies the original list, which might not be acceptable in some scenarios.

Given that the problem states that the new list should not point to nodes in the original list, and we need to make a deep copy, the hash map approach is safe and straightforward.

I'll proceed with the hash map approach for my solution.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to create a deep copy of a linked list where each node has not only a `next` pointer but also a `random` pointer that can point to any node in the list or `null`. The key is to ensure that the new linked list consists of new nodes with their respective values and correct pointers without referring back to the original list.

### Approach
1. **Create a Mapping of Original Nodes to New Nodes:**
   - Traverse the original linked list and create a new node for each node in the original list with the same value.
   - Store these new nodes in a hash map with the original nodes as keys.

2. **Set the `next` and `random` Pointers for New Nodes:**
   - Traverse the original linked list again and for each original node, set the `next` and `random` pointers of the corresponding new node using the hash map.

3. **Return the Head of the New List:**
   - The head of the new list is the new node corresponding to the head of the original list, which can be obtained from the hash map.

This approach ensures that we do not modify the original list and that all pointers in the new list are correctly set to point to other new nodes.

1. **Initialization:**

   - Initialize a boolean list `dp` of size `n+1`, where `n` is the length of `s`, with all values set to `False`. `dp[i]` will be `True` if the substring `s[0:i]` can be segmented into dictionary words.
   - Set `dp[0]` to `True`, since an empty string can always be segmented.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Iterate through the string from left to right.
   - For each position `i` from `1` to `n`, check all possible substrings ending at `i`. Specifically, for each `j` from `0` to `i-1`, if `dp[j]` is `True` and the substring `s[j:i]` is in the dictionary, set `dp[i]` to `True` and break out of the inner loop.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - The value of `dp[n]` will tell us whether the entire string can be segmented into dictionary words.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible segmentations without redundant computations.

2. **Dynamic Programming:**

    The algorithm used is a combination of depth-first search with memoization. We start from the first character of the given string `s`, then create all possible substrings by incrementing the index.

For each substring, we check if it exists in the dictionary. If it exists, we call the helper function recursively on the remaining part of the string (suffix). This will give us all the possible combinations for the suffix. Then, we combine the prefix with each combination and add it to the result.

Memoization is used to store the results of the helper function for each substring encountered, so that we don't need to compute it multiple times. This speeds up the algorithm by reducing repeated computations.

Finally, we return the list of combinations where all the words are found in the dictionary.

1. **Backtracking with Memoization**:
   - We will use a backtracking approach to explore all possible ways to split the string `s` into words from `wordDict`.
   - To optimize and avoid redundant computations, we will use memoization. We'll store the results of subproblems where subproblems are defined by the starting index in the string `s`.

2. **Steps**:
   - Define a helper function that takes the current index as a parameter.
   - If the current index reaches the end of the string, add the current path to the result.
   - For each possible word starting from the current index, if the word is in the dictionary, proceed to the next index after this word.
   - Use memoization to store the results of the helper function for each starting index.

6. When `slow` and `start` are equal, return the node where they meet, which is the start of the cycle.

    ","Given the `head` of a linked list, return _the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return_ `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (**0-indexed**). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. **Note that** `pos` **is not passed as a parameter**.

**Do not modify** the linked list.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[3,2,0,-4\], pos = 1
**Output:** tail connects to node index 1
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[1,2\], pos = 0
**Output:** tail connects to node index 0
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[1\], pos = -1
**Output:** no cycle
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
*   `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory? Additionally, the sky was clear that day.","To solve this problem, we need to detect if there is a cycle in a linked list and, if there is, find the node where the cycle begins. This is a classic problem that can be solved using the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm, which is an efficient algorithm that uses only two pointers moving at different speeds.

### Approach

1. **Detecting the Cycle:**
   - We use two pointers, a slow pointer and a fast pointer.
   - The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time.
   - If there is a cycle, these two pointers will eventually meet at some point within the cycle.

2. **Finding the Start of the Cycle:**
   - Once the two pointers meet, we know there is a cycle.
   - To find the start of the cycle, we reset one of the pointers to the head of the list.
   - Then, we move both pointers at the same speed (one step at a time).
   - The point at which they meet again is the start of the cycle.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list, and we should return `null`.
   - If the list has only one node, and it does not point to itself, there is no cycle.
   - If the list has a cycle, the algorithm will detect it and find the starting node.

**Follow up:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively? John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","So I've got this problem here about binary trees and preorder traversal. I need to return the values of the nodes in preorder traversal order. I understand that in preorder traversal, we visit the root node first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree. So for a tree like [1, null, 2, 3], the output should be [1,2,3], which matches the first example.

I need to think about how to implement this in Python. The problem mentions that a recursive solution is trivial, so maybe I should try to do it iteratively to make it more challenging. But I should also consider that recursive solutions are often easier to understand, so perhaps I'll provide both versions.

First, let's recall the structure of a binary tree node. Typically, it has a value and pointers to the left and right children. So, I should define a TreeNode class if it's not already defined.

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

Alright, with that in mind, let's think about the recursive approach. In a recursive preorder traversal, I would do something like:

1. Visit the root node (print its value or store it).

2. Recursively traverse the left subtree.

3. Recursively traverse the right subtree.

This seems straightforward. In code, it would look like:

def preorderTraversal(root):
    result = []
    def helper(node):
        if node:
            result.append(node.val)
            helper(node.left)
            helper(node.right)
    helper(root)
    return result

This should work fine, and it's easy to understand. But the follow-up question asks if I can do it iteratively. So, let's think about an iterative approach.

In an iterative solution, I'll need to use a stack to simulate the recursion. The idea is to manually manage the stack that the recursive approach would use implicitly.

Here's how I can approach it:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the result.

2. Initialize a stack and push the root node onto it if it's not null.

3. While the stack is not empty:

a. Pop the top node from the stack.

b. Visit the node (add its value to the result list).

c. Push the right child onto the stack if it exists.

d. Push the left child onto the stack if it exists.

Note that I push the right child before the left child because stacks are last-in, first-out (LIFO), and I want to process the left subtree before the right subtree.

Let me try to write this in code:

def preorderTraversal(root):
    if not root:
        return []
    stack = [root]
    result = []
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        result.append(node.val)
        if node.right:
            stack.append(node.right)
        if node.left:
            stack.append(node.left)
    return result

This should work similarly to the recursive approach. Let me test this logic with the first example: root = [1, null, 2, 3].

- Initialize stack with [1]

- While stack is not empty:

- Pop 1, add to result, push 2 (right child of 1), push 3 (left child of 2)

- Now stack is [2, 3]

- Pop 3, add to result

- Pop 2, add to result

- Stack is empty

- Result is [1,2,3]

Which matches the expected output.

Now, for the edge cases:

- root = []: Should return []

- root = [1]: Should return [1]

Let's verify with these:

- root = []:

- If root is not null: return []

- So, return []

- root = [1]:

- Initialize stack with [1]

- Pop 1, add to result

- No children, stack empty

- Return [1]

Looks good.

I think this iterative approach is efficient and straightforward. It's also easier to implement without worrying about recursion depth limits.

Alternatively, I could use a single list to simulate the stack, but using an actual stack data structure is more appropriate.

I should also consider the time and space complexity.

- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes, since each node is visited once.

- Space complexity: O(n), in the worst case (skewed tree), the stack can contain all nodes.

This seems acceptable given the constraints.

I don't think there's a way to optimize it further, as we need to store at least O(log n) space for the stack in a balanced tree, and O(n) in the worst case.

Alright, I think I've covered the iterative approach. Now, if I were to implement the recursive approach, it would be simpler but might not be as efficient for very deep trees due to recursion depth limits.

Given that the problem constraints specify that the number of nodes is in the range [0, 100], recursion should be fine, but implementing the iterative approach demonstrates a better understanding of tree traversals.

I should also consider if there's a way to do this without using a stack, but I think that would complicate things unnecessary.

Another thought: Morris traversal is a way to traverse binary trees without recursion or stack, but it modifies the tree structure temporarily. However, since the problem doesn't require preserving the tree structure, it could be an option, but it's more complex and harder to understand.

I think for this problem, the iterative approach with a stack is sufficient and efficient.

Let me summarize:

- Implemented an iterative preorder traversal using a stack.

- Handled edge cases like empty tree and single-node tree.

- Ensured correctness through manual simulation.

- Considered time and space complexity.

I believe this solution is complete and meets the requirements.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to perform a preorder traversal of a binary tree and return the values of the nodes in that order. Preorder traversal involves visiting the root node first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.

## Approach
We will use an iterative approach with a stack to traverse the tree in preorder fashion. This method simulates the recursive call stack manually.

1. **Initialize a stack and result list:**
   - Start by pushing the root node onto the stack if it exists.
   - Use a list to store the result of the traversal.

2. **Iterate while the stack is not empty:**
   - Pop the top node from the stack.
   - Add the node's value to the result list.
   - Push the right child onto the stack if it exists (to ensure left subtree is processed first).
   - Push the left child onto the stack if it exists.

This iterative method ensures that we process the nodes in the order: root, left, right, which is the definition of preorder traversal.

    The idea of the algorithm is using a stack. Initially, the root node is pushed to the stack. Next, we enter a loop that ends when the stack is empty. In each iteration, we pop a node from the stack, and insert its value at the beginning of the result list (to ensure the correct order for the postorder traversal), then, push its left child, and then its right child to the stack (if they are not null). In the end, we return the result list. The algorithm is non-recursive which makes it easier to understand for some. Since the result list will store the output in reversed order, this iterative version avoids the necessity of reversing the final output.

LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= capacity <= 3000`
*   `0 <= key <= 104`
*   `0 <= value <= 105`
*   At most `2 * 105` calls will be made to `get` and `put`. Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","Alright, I need to implement an LRU Cache in Python that adheres to the constraints provided. Let's break down what an LRU Cache is and how it should behave.

**Understanding LRU Cache:**

- **LRU Cache** stands for Least Recently Used Cache. It's a cache eviction policy where the least recently used items are removed first when the cache reaches its capacity.

- The cache has a fixed size defined by 'capacity.'

- It should support two main operations: 'get' and 'put,' both running in O(1) average time complexity.

- 'get(key)' should return the value of the key if it exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.

- 'put(key, value)' should add or update the key-value pair. If the key already exists, its value should be updated, and it should be marked as recently used. If the cache is at capacity, the least recently used item should be evicted to make space for the new item.

**Design Considerations:**

- To achieve O(1) time complexity for both 'get' and 'put' operations, we need a data structure that allows fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.

- A combination of a hash map and a doubly linked list is commonly used for this purpose.

- The hash map provides O(1) access to cache entries by key.

- The doubly linked list helps in maintaining the order of usage (most recently used to least recently used) and allows for O(1) removal and insertion.

**Implementation Plan:**

1. **Data Structures:**
   - Use a hash map (dictionary in Python) to store keys and their corresponding pointers to nodes in the doubly linked list.
   - Use a doubly linked list to maintain the order of keys based on their usage.

2. **Node Structure:**
   - Each node in the doubly linked list will store the key and value.
   - Each node will have pointers to the previous and next nodes.

3. **Cache Operations:**
   - **get(key):**
     - If the key is not present, return -1.
     - If the key is present, move the corresponding node to the head of the linked list (to mark it as most recently used) and return its value.
   - **put(key, value):**
     - If the key is already present, update its value and move the node to the head (most recently used).
     - If the key is not present:
       - If the cache is at capacity, remove the least recently used key (the tail of the linked list).
       - Add the new key-value pair as a node at the head of the linked list.
       - Update the hash map with the new key and its corresponding node.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Capacity is 1: Simplest case, easy to manage.
   - Capacity is greater than 1: Need to manage multiple entries and their order.
   - Putting a key that already exists: Need to update the value and move it to the head.
   - Getting a key that doesn't exist: Return -1.

5. **Helper Functions:**
   - Function to remove a node from the linked list.
   - Function to add a node to the head of the linked list.
   - Function to remove the tail node from the linked list.

**Potential Challenges:**

- Managing the connections in the doubly linked list, especially when removing or adding nodes.

- Ensuring that the hash map and the linked list stay consistent.

- Handling the case when the cache is empty or full.

- Dealing with the eviction policy correctly to remove the least recently used item.

**Testing:**

- Test with different capacities, including edge cases like capacity 0 or 1.

- Test sequences of get and put operations to ensure that the most recently used items are retained.

- Verify that the time complexity is maintained at O(1) for individual operations.

- Check for memory leaks or inconsistencies in the data structures.

**Optimization:**

- Ensure that all operations are indeed O(1) by avoiding any operations that might degrade to O(n) time complexity.

- Minimize overhead in node operations by keeping the node structure simple.

- Use inline functions or methods for frequently used operations to reduce overhead.

**Final Solution Code:**

To solve this problem, we need to implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache that supports `get` and `put` operations in O(1) time complexity. We achieve this by using a combination of a hash map and a doubly-linked list.

### Approach

1. **Data Structures:**
   - **Doubly Linked List:** To maintain the order of keys based on their usage (most recently used to least recently used).
   - **Hash Map (Dictionary):** For O(1) access to cache entries by key.

2. **Node Structure:**
   - Each node in the doubly linked list stores the key and value, along with pointers to the previous and next nodes.

3. **Cache Operations:**
   - **get(key):**
     - If the key is not present, return -1.
     - If the key is present, move the corresponding node to the head of the linked list (to mark it as most recently used) and return its value.
   - **put(key, value):**
     - If the key is already present, update its value and move the node to the head.
     - If the key is not present:
       - If the cache is at capacity, remove the least recently used key (the tail of the linked list).
       - Add the new key-value pair as a node at the head of the linked list.
       - Update the hash map with the new key and its corresponding node.

    The insertion sort algorithm for a linked list involves iterating through the list, removing one element at a time, and inserting it into the sorted sublist. We use a dummy node to act as the head of the sorted sublist, which initially has no elements. In each iteration, we compare the current element (its value) to the elements in the sorted sublist, and insert it into its proper position. This is done by updating the ""next"" pointers for the appropriate nodes. The process is repeated until all elements from the original list have been processed and added to the sorted sublist. At the end, the sorted sublist is returned, starting from the next node after the dummy head node.

    The given problem can be solved using the merge sort algorithm. First, we find the middle of the linked list using the slow and fast pointers technique. Then, we recursively split the list into two halves until we get multiple lists containing only one node. 

Next, we merge these single-node lists in a sorted manner. We compare the values of the nodes and connect the nodes accordingly to return the sorted list.

Finally, we combine the sorted lists back together to get the final sorted linked list.

**Follow up:** Can you sort the linked list in `O(n logn)` time and `O(1)` memory (i.e. constant space)? Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","I'm going to solve this problem of sorting a linked list in ascending order. The constraints mention that the number of nodes can be up to 5 * 10^4, and the values can range from -10^5 to 10^5. The follow-up question asks if it's possible to sort the list in O(n log n) time and O(1) memory, which suggests that we should aim for an efficient sorting algorithm that doesn't rely on extra space beyond a few variables.

First, I need to understand the structure of a linked list. Each node in a linked list has a value and a pointer to the next node. To sort the list, I need to rearrange these nodes so that they are in ascending order based on their values.

One straightforward way to sort a linked list is to use a sorting algorithm like merge sort, which is efficient and has a time complexity of O(n log n). Merge sort works particularly well with linked lists because it can be implemented efficiently without the need for random access, which is a limitation of linked lists compared to arrays.

Here's a high-level plan for implementing merge sort on a linked list:

1. **Find the middle of the list:** To split the list into two halves, I need to find the middle node. I can use the slow and fast pointer technique, where one pointer moves twice as fast as the other. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle.

2. **Split the list into two halves:** Once I have the middle node, I can split the list into two separate lists: the first half and the second half.

3. **Recursively sort each half:** Apply the merge sort function recursively to each half until each sublist has at most one element. A list with zero or one element is considered sorted.

4. **Merge the sorted halves:** Merge the two sorted sublists back into a single sorted list. This involves traversing both lists and connecting the nodes in sorted order.

5. **Return the new head of the sorted list:** After merging, return the head of the sorted list.

I need to ensure that the merge step is implemented efficiently. Since we're dealing with linked lists, we can take advantage of the fact that we can change the next pointers to rearrange the nodes without needing to copy the data.

Let me think about how to implement the merge step in more detail. I'll need to create a new dummy node to serve as the starting point of the merged list. Then, I'll maintain a current pointer that starts at this dummy node. I'll compare the values of the nodes from the two sorted lists and connect the smaller one to the current node, then move the current pointer and the pointer of the list from which the node was taken.

Here's a rough sketch of the merge function:

- Create a dummy node.
- Set current to the dummy node.
- While both lists are not empty:
- If value of list1 node < value of list2 node:
- Connect list1 node to current.next.
- Move list1 to list1.next.
- Else:
- Connect list2 node to current.next.
- Move list2 to list2.next.
- Move current to current.next.
- If list1 is not empty:
- Connect list1 to current.next.
- If list2 is not empty:
- Connect list2 to current.next.
- Return dummy.next as the head of the merged list.

For the overall merge sort function:

- If the list is empty or has only one node, return the list as it is already sorted.
- Find the middle of the list.
- Split the list into two halves.
- Recursively sort each half.
- Merge the two sorted halves.

I should also consider the space complexity. Since merge sort is recursive, the recursion stack will have a depth of O(log n), which is acceptable given the constraints.

Let me consider if there are any other sorting algorithms that could be more efficient in terms of space. For example, insertion sort has a space complexity of O(1), but its time complexity is O(n^2), which may not be efficient for large lists. Quick sort could be an option, but it's generally more complex to implement with linked lists and may not guarantee O(n log n) time in the worst case.

Given that, merge sort seems like the most suitable choice for this problem.

Now, I need to think about how to implement this in Python. I'll need to define the ListNode class, which presumably is already defined since it's a common structure for linked lists. However, for completeness, I can include it in my code.

2. **Slope Calculation**: The slope between two points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) is given by \((y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\). To avoid precision issues with floating points, we will represent the slope as a fraction in its reduced form.
3. **Counting Slopes**: We will use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each slope. The slope with the highest count will indicate the line with the most points passing through the reference point.
4. **Tracking Maximum**: We will keep track of the maximum number of points lying on the same line for all reference points and return the overall maximum.

### Approach

1. **Understand RPN Evaluation**:
   - In RPN, we process the expression from left to right.
   - When we encounter an operand, we push it onto a stack.
   - When we encounter an operator, we pop the top one or two operands from the stack, apply the operator, and push the result back onto the stack.

2. **Stack Data Structure**:
   - A stack is ideal for this problem because it allows us to manage the operands in the correct order for applying operators.

3. **Handling Operators**:
   - We need to handle four operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.
   - For division, we must truncate the result towards zero.

   - Ensure that the input is valid as per the problem constraints.

3. Join the reversed array of words into a single string with a space delimiter. In C++, we concatenate words with a space but avoid adding an extra space at the end. In Java, we use `String.join()`, in Python, use `join()` on the delimiter string, and in JavaScript, use `join()` on the array.

John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","I can definitely help you with that Python problem! So, the task is to reverse the order of words in a given string. The string may contain multiple spaces between words, and there might be leading or trailing spaces as well. The goal is to reverse the words and ensure that there's only a single space separating them in the output.

First, let's understand what needs to be done. We have a string `s`, and we need to split it into words, reverse the order of these words, and then join them back together with a single space between each word.

For example, if `s = ""the sky is blue ""`, the output should be `""blue is sky the ""`. Notice that the order of the words is reversed, and there's only one space between each word.

Similarly, for `s = ""  hello world   ""`, the output should be `""world hello""`, without any leading or trailing spaces.

Another example is `s = ""a good   example ""`, which should become `""example good a ""`.

Okay, so the main steps are:

1. **Split the string into words:** We need to split the string by spaces, but we have to handle multiple spaces and leading/trailing spaces correctly.

2. **Reverse the order of the words:** Once we have the words in a list, we can reverse the list.

3. **Join the words with a single space:** Finally, we join the reversed list of words with a single space to form the final string.

Now, let's think about how to implement this in Python.

First, splitting the string into words can be tricky because there might be multiple spaces between words. In Python, the `split()` function can handle this by default. It splits the string by whitespace and ignores leading and trailing spaces.

   - `result` stores the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - We iterate through each number in the array.
   - For each number, we update `max_product` and `min_product` considering the current number.
   - This is because a negative number can turn a minimum product into a maximum product and vice versa.
   - We update the `result` with the maximum value found during these updates.

3. **Handling Zeros**:
   - If we encounter a zero in the array, the product ending at that position becomes zero.
   - We need to handle this by resetting `max_product` and `min_product` to 1 after updating the `result`.

So, there's this array that's sorted in ascending order, but it's been rotated somewhere between 1 and n times, where n is the length of the array. I need to find the minimum element in this rotated array, and I have to do it in O(log n) time. That tells me I probably need to use a binary search approach because regular searching would be O(n), which is too slow for this requirement.

Let me think about how rotation affects the array. If the array is rotated, it means that somewhere in the array, it's been split, and the last part is moved to the front. For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] rotated 4 times becomes [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]. So, the array is still sorted in two parts: from the rotation point to the end, and from the start to the rotation point.

The key here is to find that rotation point, which is where the minimum element is located. In the example, the rotation point is at index 4, where the value is 0, which is the minimum.

So, how can I find this rotation point efficiently? Binary search seems suitable because I can compare the middle element with the end element to decide which half to discard.

Let's consider:

- If the middle element is greater than the end element, that means the rotation point is in the right half.

- Otherwise, it's in the left half.

Wait, let me think about that again.

Actually, in a rotated sorted array, the left part (from the start to the rotation point) is sorted, and the right part (from the rotation point to the end) is also sorted.

But the rotation point is where the array was rotated, and that's where the smallest element is.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize two pointers, low and high, to the start and end of the array.

While low < high:

- Find mid = (low + high) // 2

- If nums[mid] > nums[high], the minimum is in the right part.

- Else, the minimum is in the left part including mid.

Wait, in the example [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]:

- low = 0 (4)

- high = 6 (2)

- mid = 3 (7)

- nums[mid] = 7 > nums[high] = 2, so the minimum is in the right part.

- Set low = mid + 1 = 4

- Now, low = 4 (0)

- high = 6 (2)

- mid = 5 (1)

- nums[mid] = 1 > nums[high] = 2, no, 1 < 2, so the minimum is in the left part.

- Set high = mid

- Now, low = 4 (0)

- high = 5 (1)

- mid = 4 (0)

- nums[mid] = 0 > nums[high] = 1? 0 < 1, so set high = mid

- Now, low and high both point to 4 (0), which is the minimum.

This seems to work.

Let me try another example: [3,4,5,1,2]

- low = 0 (3)

- high = 4 (2)

- mid = 2 (5)

- 5 > 2, so set low = mid + 1 = 3

- Now, low = 3 (1)

- high = 4 (2)

- mid = 3 (1)

- 1 > 2? 1 < 2, so set high = mid

- Now, low = 3 (1)

- high = 3 (1)

- So, the minimum is at index 3, which is 1.

Good.

Another example: [1,2,3,4,5]

- low = 0 (1)

- high = 4 (5)

- mid = 2 (3)

- 3 > 5? No, so set high = mid

- low = 0 (1)

- high = 2 (3)

- mid = 1 (2)

- 2 > 5? No, set high = mid

- low = 0 (1)

- high = 1 (2)

- mid = 0 (1)

- 1 > 5? No, set high = mid

- low and high both point to 0, which is the minimum.

Perfect.

So, the algorithm seems to work.

Now, let's think about the base cases.

If the array has only one element, return that element.

If the array is not rotated (i.e., the first element is smaller than the last), return the first element.

Wait, in the last example, first element is 1 and last is 5, and the minimum is 1.

In the first example, first is 3 and last is 2, and minimum is 1.

So, if nums[low] < nums[high], the array is not rotated, and the minimum is nums[low].

Otherwise, continue the binary search.

Wait, but in the first example, nums[low] = 3 > nums[high] = 2, so it is rotated, and we need to find the minimum.

So, the condition should be: if nums[low] > nums[high], it's rotated, else it's not.

If it's not rotated, return nums[low].

If it is rotated, proceed with binary search.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says the array is rotated between 1 and n times. So, even if it's rotated n times, it's back to the original sorted array, which is considered rotated.

Wait, no, the problem says ""between 1 and n times"". So, if it's rotated n times, it's back to the original, but according to the constraints, nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

Wait, but in the third example, [11,13,15,17], which is sorted, and it's rotated 4 times, which is equal to the length, so it's back to sorted.

But the problem says ""rotated between 1 and n times"", inclusive.

So, I need to handle the case where the array is rotated 0 times as well, but according to the problem, it's rotated between 1 and n times.

Wait, in the constraints, it says ""rotated between 1 and n times"".

So, I don't need to handle the case where it's not rotated at all.

Wait, but in the third example, it's rotated 4 times, which is equal to the length, which is the same as not rotated.

But according to the problem, it's rotated between 1 and n times, inclusive.

So, I need to make sure that even if it's rotated n times, which brings it back to the original sorted array, I still need to find the minimum, which is the first element.

Wait, in that case, the minimum is still the first element.

So, perhaps the condition should be: if nums[low] < nums[high], return nums[low], because it's either not rotated or rotated n times.

Else, proceed with binary search.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's rotated between 1 and n times, so it could be rotated n times, which is equivalent to not rotated.

In that case, the minimum is still the first element.

But in the first example, it's rotated 3 times, and the minimum is not the first element.

So, perhaps the condition is: if nums[low] < nums[high], return nums[low], else proceed with binary search.

Yes, that seems to make sense.

Because if nums[low] < nums[high], it means the array is not rotated, or rotated n times, and the minimum is at nums[low].

Else, it's rotated somewhere, and I need to find the rotation point.

Wait, but in the third example, [11,13,15,17], which is sorted, and rotated 4 times (which is n), and the minimum is 11, which is nums[low].

So, in that case, if nums[low] < nums[high], return nums[low].

Else, proceed with binary search.

That seems consistent.

Let me try to code this.

Initialize low = 0, high = len(nums) - 1

While low < high:

- mid = (low + high) // 2

- if nums[mid] > nums[high]:

- low = mid + 1

- else:

- high = mid

Return nums[low]

Wait, in the first example:

nums = [3,4,5,1,2]

low = 0, high = 4

mid = 2, nums[2] = 5 > nums[4] = 2, so low = 3

Now, low = 3, high = 4

mid = 3, nums[3] = 1 > nums[4] = 2, no, 1 < 2, so high = 3

Now, low = 3, high = 3, so return nums[3] = 1

Good.

In the second example:

nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]

low = 0, high = 6

mid = 3, nums[3] = 7 > nums[6] = 2, so low = 4

Now, low = 4, high = 6

mid = 5, nums[5] = 1 > nums[6] = 2, no, 1 < 2, so high = 5

Now, low = 4, high = 5

mid = 4, nums[4] = 0 > nums[6] = 2, no, 0 < 2, so high = 4

Now, low = 4, high = 4, return nums[4] = 0

Perfect.

In the third example:

nums = [11,13,15,17]

low = 0, high = 3

nums[0] = 11 < nums[3] = 17, so return nums[0] = 11

Correct.

Seems to work.

Let me think about another example.

Suppose nums = [5,1,2,3,4]

low = 0, high = 4

mid = 2, nums[2] = 2 > nums[4] = 4, no, 2 < 4, so high = 2

Now, low = 0, high = 2

mid = 1, nums[1] = 1 > nums[4] = 4, no, 1 < 4, so high = 1

Now, low = 0, high = 1

mid = 0, nums[0] = 5 > nums[4] = 4, so low = 1

Now, low = 1, high = 1, return nums[1] = 1

Correct.

Another example: nums = [2,1]

low = 0, high = 1

nums[0] = 2 > nums[1] = 1, so low = 1

Return nums[1] = 1

Good.

Seems solid.

I think this approach should work.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum element in a sorted and rotated array of unique elements. The array is rotated between 1 and n times, where n is the length of the array. We must achieve this in O(log n) time complexity, which suggests using a binary search approach.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**: We initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
2. **Binary Search Modification**:
   - While `low` is less than `high`, we calculate the middle index `mid`.
   - If the element at `mid` is greater than the element at `high`, it means the rotation point (and thus the minimum element) is in the right half of the array. Therefore, we update `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the rotation point is in the left half (including `mid`), so we update `high` to `mid`.
3. **Termination**: The loop ends when `low` equals `high`, indicating that `low` is at the rotation point where the minimum element is located.

    The overall algorithm is based on the binary search. We maintain two pointers low and high, initially set to the first and last indices of array nums. Then we perform the following steps until low is less than high:

1. Calculate mid index.
2. If nums[mid] is greater than nums[high], it means the minimum element lies in the right half of the array, so we set low to mid + 1.
3. If nums[mid] is less than nums[high], it means the minimum element lies in the left half of the array, so we set high to mid.
4. If nums[mid] is equal to nums[high], we cannot be certain in which half the minimum element lies, so we simply decrement high by 1.

At the end, the minimum element will be at index low. The solution takes O(log n) time in the average case and O(n) in the worst case.

Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why? Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum element in a sorted and rotated array that may contain duplicates. The array is rotated between 1 and n times, where n is the length of the array.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The array is initially sorted in ascending order.
   - It is then rotated, meaning some elements from the end are moved to the start.
   - The rotation can happen multiple times, but since rotating n times brings the array back to its original state, the effective rotation is between 1 and n times.
   - The array may contain duplicates, which complicates the search for the minimum element.

2. **Key Insights:**
   - In a sorted and rotated array without duplicates, we can use binary search to find the minimum element efficiently.
   - Duplicates can make it difficult to decide which half of the array to discard during binary search, as the start, middle, and end elements might be equal.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - Use a binary search approach.
   - Compare the middle element with the end element to decide which half might contain the minimum.
   - If the middle element is greater than the end element, the minimum must be in the right half.
   - If the middle element is less than the end element, the minimum is in the left half.
   - If they are equal, we cannot decide directly due to duplicates, so we reduce the search space by moving the start pointer forward.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Array with all elements the same.
   - Array with duplicates.
   - Array rotated n times (i.e., original sorted array).
   - Array with single element.

Now buf4 =  ""abcd "", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  ""e "", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  "" "", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The `read` function will only be called once for each test case.
*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** file =  ""abc "", n = 4
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  ""abc "". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
Note that  ""abc "" is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** file =  ""abcde "", n = 5
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  ""abcde "". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** file =  ""abcdABCD1234 "", n = 12
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  ""abcdABCD1234 "". We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12.

**Constraints:**

*   `file` consist of English letters and digits.
*   `1 <= n <= 1000`","

    while total_read < n:

        for i in range(read4_count):
            if total_read < n:

    The algorithm relies on the read4 function provided, which reads 4 characters at a time. We read and store these characters in a buffer (`buf4`) and then transfer them one by one into the destination buffer (`buf`) until we reach the desired number of characters (`n`). We repeat this process until we have read `n` characters or reached the end of the `file`. If we reach the end of the file, the read4 function will return less than 4 characters, which is detected and used to break the loop.

In each language, we declare a buffer `buf4` of length 4 to store the characters read using the read4 function. We keep track of the total characters read (`totalRead`) and iterate through the characters in `buf4`, transferring them one by one to the destination buffer `buf`. We make sure not to exceed the requested number of characters `n`.

Once we reach the end of the file, the read4 function will return less than 4 characters. If this happens, we break the loop and return the total number of characters read, which is stored in `totalRead`.

The `read4` method reads up to 4 characters at a time into a buffer array `buf4` and returns the number of characters actually read.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We need a buffer to hold the characters read from `read4`.
   - We also need to keep track of the characters read so far and the total number of characters read.

2. **Reading Characters**:
   - We will repeatedly call `read4` until we have read `n` characters or there are no more characters to read.
   - In each call to `read4`, we read up to 4 characters and copy them to the destination buffer `buf`.
   - We need to keep track of the number of characters read in each `read4` call and stop when we have read enough characters or when `read4` returns fewer characters than requested.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is 0, we should return 0 immediately.
   - If the file has fewer characters than `n`, we should read all available characters and return the actual number read.
   - We need to handle cases where `read4` returns fewer than 4 characters, indicating the end of the file.

In the `read` method, the first step is to check if we need to read more characters from `read4`. This is done by checking if `buffer_index` is equal to `buffer_len`. If it is, then we call `read4` and reset the `buffer_index` to 0.

If the number of characters read from `read4` is 0, then we have reached the end of the file, so we break out of the loop.

Next, we copy the characters from `buf4` to the destination buffer `buf` until either we have read enough characters (`cnt` equals `n`), or there are no more characters to copy from `buf4` (`buffer_index` equals `buffer_len`). After copying characters, we increment `cnt` and `buffer_index` accordingly.

### Approach

1. **Buffer Management:** We need to manage an internal buffer that stores characters read from the file that haven't been completely consumed yet. This way, if `read4` reads more characters than requested, we can store the extra characters for future calls to `read`.

2. **File Pointer Tracking:** Since we can't manipulate the file directly, we need to keep track of the file pointer ourselves. This involves knowing how many characters have been read so far and managing the position in the file.

3. **Efficient Reading:** We should minimize the number of calls to `read4` by reading ahead and storing unused characters for future `read` calls.

    The algorithm implements a sliding window approach. We maintain two pointers `l` and `r` representing the left and right ends of the current substring. We also maintain a hash map `char_count` to store the counts of distinct characters in the current substring.

We iterate through the string with pointer `r`. For each character, we increment its count in the hash map. If we have two or fewer distinct characters in the current substring, we update the current length `cur_len`. If we have more than two distinct characters, we move the pointer `l` to the right, decrementing the count of the character at `l` in the hash map, and removing it if its count becomes zero. We update `cur_len` accordingly in the process.

At each step, we update the maximum length `max_len` with the maximum of `max_len` and `cur_len`. We return `max_len` at the end.

For example, in the string ""eceba"", the longest such substring is ""ece"", which has a length of 3. Another example is ""ccaabbb"", where ""aabbb"" is the longest substring with at most two distinct characters, length 5.

Alright, so I need to come up with an efficient way to solve this. Since we're dealing with substrings and constraints on the number of distinct characters, I think a sliding window approach would be suitable here. Sliding windows are great for problems that involve finding substrings with certain properties.

So, the basic idea of a sliding window is to maintain a window that satisfies the given condition—in this case, having at most two distinct characters. We'll expand the window to include new characters as long as the condition holds, and if adding a new character violates the condition, we'll shrink the window from the left until the condition is satisfied again.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Initialize two pointers, let's say `left` and `right`, both starting at the beginning of the string. These will define our window.

2. Use a dictionary to keep track of the count of each character within the current window.

3. Move the `right` pointer to the right, one character at a time, adding characters to the dictionary.

4. If the number of distinct characters in the dictionary exceeds two, move the `left` pointer to the right until the number of distinct characters is two or less.

5. At each step, keep track of the maximum length of the window that satisfies the condition.

Let me consider the first example: s = ""eceba"".

- Start with left=0, right=0, window=""e"", distinct count=1.

- Move right to 1, window=""ec"", distinct count=2.

- Move right to 2, window=""ece"", distinct count=2.

- Move right to 3, window=""ceba"", distinct count=3 (exceeds 2).

- Move left to 1, window=""cba"", distinct count=3.

- Move left to 2, window=""ba"", distinct count=2.

- Move right to 4, window=""ba"", distinct count=2.

The maximum window length here is 3.

Another example: s = ""ccaabbb"".

- left=0, right=0, window=""c"", count=1.

- right=1, window=""cc"", count=1.

- right=2, window=""cca"", count=2.

- right=3, window=""caab"", count=2.

- right=4, window=""aab"", count=2.

- right=5, window=""abbb"", count=2.

- right=6, window=""bbb"", count=1.

The maximum window length is 5.

This seems to work. Now, I need to think about the edge cases.

- If the string has only one unique character, like ""aaaaa"", the entire string is the substring, length 5.

- If the string has exactly two unique characters, like ""ababab"", the entire string is the substring, length 6.

- If the string has only one character, like ""a"", it should return 1.

- If the string is empty, but according to the constraints, s.length >= 1, so no need to handle empty strings.

- If the string has all unique characters, like ""abcde"", the maximum substring length should be 2, since we can only have two distinct characters.

Wait, in ""abcde"", the maximum substring with at most two distinct characters is ""ab"", ""bc"", ""cd"", or ""de"", all of length 2.

Another thing to consider is repeated characters.

- For ""eecc"", it should be ""eec"" or ""ecc"", length 3.

- For ""eehhcc"", possible substrings are ""eehh"", ""ehhh"", ""hhcc"", all length 4.

I need to make sure that the code can handle these cases correctly.

Now, let's think about the implementation.

I'll use a dictionary to keep track of the count of each character in the current window.

I'll initialize left and right pointers at 0.

I'll iterate with the right pointer from 0 to len(s)-1.

At each step, I'll add the character at right to the dictionary.

If the number of keys in the dictionary is greater than 2, I'll start moving the left pointer to the right until the number of distinct characters is <=2.

While moving the left pointer, I'll decrease the count of the character at left in the dictionary, and if its count drops to zero, I'll remove it from the dictionary.

At each step, I'll update the maximum length found.

This seems straightforward.

Let me try to write some pseudocode.

Initialize:

left = 0

dict = {}

max_length = 0

For right in 0 to len(s)-1:

if s[right] in dict:

dict[s[right]] +=1

else:

dict[s[right]] =1

While len(dict) >2:

dict[s[left]] -=1

if dict[s[left]] ==0:

del dict[s[left]]

left +=1

max_length = max(max_length, right - left +1)

Return max_length

This looks similar to the standard sliding window approach for this kind of problem.

Let me test this logic with the first example: s = ""eceba""

- right=0: dict={'e':1}

- len(dict)=1 <=2, max_length=1

- right=1: dict={'e':1, 'c':1}

- len(dict)=2 <=2, max_length=2

- right=2: dict={'e':2, 'c':1}

- len(dict)=2 <=2, max_length=3

- right=3: dict={'e':2, 'c':1, 'b':1}

- len(dict)=3 >2

- left=0, dict['e']-=1 => dict={'e':1, 'c':1, 'b':1}

- len(dict)=3 still >2

- left=1, dict['c']-=1 => dict={'e':1, 'c':0, 'b':1}

- del dict['c'], dict={'e':1, 'b':1}

- len(dict)=2 <=2, max_length=3 (same as before)

- right=4: dict={'e':1, 'b':1, 'a':1}

- len(dict)=3 >2

- left=2, dict['e']-=1 => dict={'e':0, 'b':1, 'a':1}

- del dict['e'], dict={'b':1, 'a':1}

- len(dict)=2 <=2, max_length=3 (same as before)

Seems correct.

Another example: s = ""ccaabbb""

- right=0: dict={'c':1}

- len=1 <=2, max=1

- right=1: dict={'c':2}

- len=1 <=2, max=2

- right=2: dict={'c':2, 'a':1}

- len=2 <=2, max=3

- right=3: dict={'c':2, 'a':2}

- len=2 <=2, max=4

- right=4: dict={'c':2, 'a':2, 'b':1}

- len=3 >2

- left=0, dict['c']-=1 => dict={'c':1, 'a':2, 'b':1}

- len=3 still >2

- left=1, dict['c']-=1 => dict={'c':0, 'a':2, 'b':1}

- del dict['c'], dict={'a':2, 'b':1}

- len=2 <=2, max=4 (same)

- right=5: dict={'a':2, 'b':2}

- len=2 <=2, max=4

- right=6: dict={'a':2, 'b':3}

- len=2 <=2, max=4

Wait, according to this, the max_length is 4, but in the example, it's 5.

Wait, according to my earlier manual calculation, it should be 5 for ""aabbb"".

Wait, let's see:

- s = ""c"",""c"",""a"",""a"",""b"",""b"",""b""

- indices: 0:c, 1:c, 2:a, 3:a, 4:b, 5:b, 6:b

- According to the above steps:

- left=0, right=0: dict={'c':1}, max=1

- right=1: dict={'c':2}, max=2

- right=2: dict={'c':2,'a':1}, max=3

- right=3: dict={'c':2,'a':2}, max=4

- right=4: dict={'c':2,'a':2,'b':1}, len=3 >2

- left=0, dict['c']-=1 => {'c':1,'a':2,'b':1}, still len=3

- left=1, dict['c']-=1 => {'c':0,'a':2,'b':1}, del 'c', {'a':2,'b':1}, len=2 <=2, max=4

- right=5: dict={'a':2,'b':2}, max=4

- right=6: dict={'a':2,'b':3}, max=4

Hmm, but ""aabbb"" is from index 2 to 6, which is length 5.

But according to the above, max_length is 4.

Wait, there must be a mistake in the above simulation.

Let's re-simulate carefully:

- left=0, right=0: dict={'c':1}, max=1

- right=1: dict={'c':2}, max=2

- right=2: dict={'c':2,'a':1}, max=3

- right=3: dict={'c':2,'a':2}, max=4

- right=4: dict={'c':2,'a':2,'b':1}, len=3 >2

- left=0, dict['c']-=1 => {'c':1,'a':2,'b':1}, len=3 >2

- left=1, dict['c']-=1 => {'c':0,'a':2,'b':1}, del 'c', {'a':2,'b':1}, len=2 <=2, max=4

- right=5: dict={'a':2,'b':2}, max=4

- right=6: dict={'a':2,'b':3}, max=4

Wait, but ""aabbb"" starts at index 2, which is s[2:7], length 5.

But according to the above, max_length is 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when left is moved, the window size is right - left +1.

Wait, in the step where left=1, right=4, dict={'a':2,'b':1}, window size is 4-1+1=4.

Then right=5, dict={'a':2,'b':2}, window size 5-1+1=5.

Wait, so max_length should be 5.

But in the earlier simulation, at right=4, after moving left to 1, max_length is max(4, 4)=4.

Then at right=5, max_length is max(4,5)=5.

Wait, yes, I think I miscalculated earlier.

So, max_length should be 5.

Okay, good.

Now, let's think about the implementation in Python.

I need to handle the dictionary properly, making sure to update the counts correctly and remove entries when their count drops to zero.

Also, need to handle the initial cases where the string is small.

Let me think about the time complexity.

The time complexity should be O(n), since each character is visited at most twice: once by the right pointer, once by the left pointer.

Space complexity is O(1), since the dictionary can have at most 3 keys, but in practice, it's bounded by the number of distinct characters allowed plus one.

Wait, no, in the sliding window approach, the dictionary can have more than two keys if we haven't yet removed the extra ones.

But in this specific problem, since we're maintaining at most two distinct characters, the dictionary should have at most two keys most of the time, except temporarily when we have to remove the extra one.

But in the general case, for at most k distinct characters, the space would be O(k).

But here, k=2, so space is O(1).

Now, let's think about writing the code.

I need to initialize left=0, dict={}, max_length=0.

Then loop with right from 0 to len(s)-1:

dict[s[right]] +=1

while len(dict) >2:

dict[s[left]] -=1

if dict[s[left]] ==0:

del dict[s[left]]

left +=1

max_length = max(max_length, right - left +1)

Return max_length

Seems straightforward.

Let me consider some edge cases.

Edge case 1: s = ""aa""

- left=0, right=0: dict={'a':1}, max=1

- right=1: dict={'a':2}, max=2

- max_length=2

Correct.

Edge case 2: s = ""abcde""

- right=0: dict={'a':1}, max=1

- right=1: dict={'a':1,'b':1}, max=2

- right=2: dict={'a':1,'b':1,'c':1}, len=3 >2

- left=0, dict['a']-=1 => del 'a', dict={'b':1,'c':1}, left=1

- right=2: already processed

- right=3: dict={'b':1,'c':1,'d':1}, len=3 >2

- left=1, dict['b']-=1 => del 'b', dict={'c':1,'d':1}, left=2

- right=4: dict={'c':1,'d':1,'e':1}, len=3 >2

- left=2, dict['c']-=1 => del 'c', dict={'d':1,'e':1}, left=3

- right=4: already processed

- max_length=2

Correct.

Edge case 3: s = ""a""

- left=0, right=0: dict={'a':1}, max=1

- max_length=1

Correct.

Edge case 4: s = ""abaccc""

- right=0: dict={'a':1}, max=1

- right=1: dict={'a':1,'b':1}, max=2

- right=2: dict={'a':2,'b':1}, max=3

- right=3: dict={'a':2,'b':1,'c':1}, len=3 >2

- left=0, dict['a']-=1 => dict={'a':1,'b':1,'c':1}, len=3 >2

- left=1, dict['b']-=1 => del 'b', dict={'a':1,'c':1}, left=2

- right=3: already processed

- right=4: dict={'a':1,'c':2}, max=3

- right=5: dict={'a':1,'c':3}, max=3

Correct, the longest substring with at most two distinct characters is ""aaccc"", length 3.

Wait, is ""aaccc"" valid? It has two distinct characters, 'a' and 'c'.

Yes, that's correct.

Another thought: what if the string is very large, say 10^5 characters?

The time complexity is O(n), which should be acceptable.

I need to make sure that the implementation is efficient and doesn't have any unnecessary operations inside the loops.

Now, let's think about writing the actual Python code.

I need to handle the dictionary carefully, ensuring that I don't have any key errors.

Also, need to make sure that I'm using integer variables for left, right, and max_length.

I should also consider the possibility of the string containing only one unique character, which should return the entire string length.

Let me write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest substring in a given string that contains at most two distinct characters. We will use a sliding window approach to efficiently solve this problem.

### Approach

1. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - We maintain a window defined by two pointers, `left` and `right`, which traverse the string.
   - A dictionary is used to track the count of each character within the current window.
   - The `right` pointer expands the window by including new characters.
   - If the number of distinct characters in the window exceeds two, the `left` pointer moves forward to reduce the window size until only two distinct characters remain.
   - At each step, we update the maximum length of the window that satisfies the condition.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Strings with fewer than or equal to two distinct characters.
   - Strings with all identical characters.
   - Strings where all characters are unique.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

*   `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
*   `listA` - The first linked list.
*   `listB` - The second linked list.
*   `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 8, listA = \[4,1,8,4,5\], listB = \[5,6,1,8,4,5\], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[4,1,8,4,5\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[5,6,1,8,4,5\]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

From the head of A, it reads as \[1,9,1,2,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[3,2,4\]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = \[2,6,4\], listB = \[1,5\], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[2,6,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[1,5\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.

    The algorithm uses two pointers, one for each linked list head (headA and headB). The pointers traverse through the lists such that they traverse the sum of the node count of both lists. If the lists intersect at a node, the pointers will eventually meet at this intersection node because they will have traversed the same number of total nodes. If the lists do not intersect, the pointers will meet at the end of the lists, resulting in both pointers being null, and the function will return null.

### Approach

1. **Calculate Lengths:** First, we need to find the lengths of both linked lists. This will help us determine which list is longer and by how much.

2. **Align Pointers:** We'll then align the starting points of both pointers by moving the pointer of the longer list forward by the difference in lengths. This ensures that both pointers will reach the intersection point at the same time if they are moved simultaneously.

3. **Find Intersection:** Finally, we'll move both pointers one step at a time until they meet. The point where they meet is the intersection point. If they do not meet by the time they reach the end, there is no intersection.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

    For this problem, we can use the binary search. Instead of comparing the mid-element to the target value, we compare it with its neighbors. Based on the comparison, we adjust the left and right pointers accordingly:

1. Initialize left and right pointer, `left = 0` and `right = nums.length - 1`.
2. While `left < right`, do the following:
   a. Calculate the mid index, `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`.
   b. If `nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]`, move the left pointer to `mid + 1`.
   c. Else, move the right pointer to the `mid`.
3. When `left >= right`, the peak index is found, so return `left`.

Since we use a binary search, the algorithm runs in O(log n) time.

So, a peak element is one that's greater than its neighbors. The array is imagined to have negative infinity outside of its bounds, so for elements at the ends, we only need to compare them with their one neighbor.

The task is to find any peak element and return its index. Also, there's a constraint that the algorithm should run in O(log n) time, which suggests that a binary search approach is likely needed.

First, I need to understand what a peak element is. Given an array like [1, 2, 3, 1], the peak is 3, which is at index 2. In the array [1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4], there are multiple peaks: 2 at index 1, 6 at index 5, and possibly others. The problem says to return any peak, so I don't have to worry about which one to choose.

Now, the array is said to have the property that nums[i]!= nums[i + 1] for all valid i, which means that adjacent elements are never equal. This is important because it ensures that the array is always changing, either increasing or decreasing between elements.

Given that, I can think about the array in terms of its slopes: where it's increasing or decreasing. A peak would be a point where the array changes from increasing to decreasing.

Since the problem requires a O(log n) time complexity, a binary search seems appropriate. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, and that's efficient for sorted arrays or arrays with some sorted properties.

In this case, even though the entire array might not be sorted, I can use the properties of the array to decide which half to pick at each step.

Here's an idea:

1. Initialize two pointers, low and high, to the start and end of the array.

2. While low < high, do:

a. Calculate mid as (low + high) // 2.

b. Compare nums[mid] with nums[mid + 1]:

i. If nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1], then there must be a peak element on the right side of mid (including mid + 1). So, set low = mid + 1.

ii. Otherwise, there must be a peak element on the left side of mid (including mid). So, set high = mid.

3. When low == high, that's the index of a peak element.

Wait, but why does this work?

Let's think about it:

- If nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1], then the array is increasing at mid, so there must be a peak to the right. This is because the array cannot increase forever since it's finite and imagined to have negative infinity at the end.

- If nums[mid] >= nums[mid + 1], then the array is decreasing or flat at mid, so there must be a peak to the left, including mid itself.

Actually, since nums[i]!= nums[i + 1], nums[mid]!= nums[mid + 1], so in the second case, it's either nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1] or nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]. But given the problem statement says nums[i]!= nums[i + 1], I can safely assume that they are not equal.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says ""nums[i]!= nums[i + 1] for all valid i"", so yes, they are always different.

Therefore, in the second case, if nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1], then mid could be a peak (depending on the left neighbor), or there might be a peak to the left.

But actually, by choosing high = mid in that case, I'm keeping mid in the search space, which is correct because mid could be the peak.

Let me test this logic with the first example:

nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]

low = 0, high = 3

mid = 1

nums[1] = 2 < nums[2] = 3, so set low = 2

Now, low = 2, high = 3

mid = 2

nums[2] = 3 > nums[3] = 1, so set high = 2

Now, low = 2, high = 2

So, return index 2, which is correct.

Another example:

nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4]

low = 0, high = 6

mid = 3

nums[3] = 3 < nums[4] = 5, so set low = 4

Now, low = 4, high = 6

mid = 5

nums[5] = 6 > nums[6] = 4, so set high = 5

Now, low = 4, high = 5

mid = 4

nums[4] = 5 < nums[5] = 6, so set low = 5

Now, low = 5, high = 5

So, return index 5, which is correct.

Another test case: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

low = 0, high = 4

mid = 2

nums[2] = 3 < nums[3] = 4, so set low = 3

Now, low = 3, high = 4

mid = 3

nums[3] = 4 < nums[4] = 5, so set low = 4

Now, low = 4, high = 4

Return index 4, which is the peak.

Another test case: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

low = 0, high = 4

mid = 2

nums[2] = 3 > nums[3] = 2, so set high = 2

Now, low = 0, high = 2

mid = 1

nums[1] = 4 > nums[2] = 3, so set high = 1

Now, low = 0, high = 1

mid = 0

nums[0] = 5 > nums[1] = 4, so set high = 0

Return index 0, which is the peak.

Edge case: single element array, e.g., [0]

low = 0, high = 0

Return index 0.

Edge case: two elements, e.g., [1, 2]

low = 0, high = 1

mid = 0

nums[0] = 1 < nums[1] = 2, so set low = 1

Now, low = 1, high = 1

Return index 1.

Similarly, [2, 1] would return index 0.

Seems to work.

Now, I need to implement this in Python.

I need to handle the case where the array has only one element, which should directly return that index.

Also, need to ensure that mid + 1 doesn't go out of bounds, but in the loop condition, since low < high and high starts at len(nums) - 1, mid + 1 should be fine as long as low < high.

Wait, but in the case where low = high - 1, mid = low, and mid + 1 = low + 1, which is high, which is valid.

I think it's safe.

Let me write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find a peak element in an array where a peak element is defined as one that is strictly greater than its neighbors. The array is considered to have virtual negative infinity elements outside its bounds, ensuring that boundary elements can be peaks if they are greater than their single neighbor.

### Approach
1. **Intuition**: Since the array is not fully sorted, but we need an O(log n) time complexity solution, binary search is a suitable approach.
2. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the array.
   - Use a while loop with the condition `low < high`:
     - Calculate the middle index `mid`.
     - Compare the element at `mid` with the element at `mid + 1`:
       - If `nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]`, there must be a peak to the right, so move the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`.
       - Otherwise, there must be a peak to the left (including `mid`), so move the `high` pointer to `mid`.
   - When `low` converges to `high`, that index will point to a peak element.

So, the task is to find all the missing numbers in a given range [lower, upper], excluding the numbers provided in a sorted unique integer array called nums. Then, we need to represent these missing numbers as ranges, and format those ranges as specified.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. We have a range from lower to upper, inclusive, and a sorted list of unique integers nums, where all elements are within this range. We need to find all the numbers in the [lower, upper] range that are not present in nums and represent them as ranges.

For example, if nums = [0,1,3,50,75] and lower = 0, upper = 99, the missing numbers are 2, 4 to 49, 51 to 74, and 76 to 99. So, the output should be [""2"", ""4->49"", ""51->74"", ""76->99""].

Another example is nums = [-1], lower = -1, upper = -1, which should return an empty list since there are no missing numbers.

Okay, so the plan is to iterate through the nums array and find the gaps between consecutive numbers, where those gaps represent the missing numbers.

But I also need to consider the edges. That is, if the first number in nums is greater than lower, then there are missing numbers from lower to nums[0]-1. Similarly, if the last number in nums is less than upper, then there are missing numbers from nums[-1]+1 to upper.

Also, since nums is sorted and unique, I don't have to worry about duplicates or sorting.

So, maybe I can initialize a result list and iterate through nums, checking for gaps between lower and the first number, between consecutive numbers in nums, and between the last number and upper.

Let me think about how to implement this.

I can start by initializing an empty list to store the result.

Then, I need to handle the case before the first number in nums. If nums[0] > lower, then there are missing numbers from lower to nums[0]-1.

Similarly, between each pair of consecutive numbers in nums, if there's a gap greater than 1, then there are missing numbers in that gap.

Finally, after the last number in nums, if nums[-1] < upper, then there are missing numbers from nums[-1]+1 to upper.

So, I need to iterate through nums, keeping track of the previous number, and check for gaps.

Let me consider edge cases:

1. If nums is empty, then all numbers from lower to upper are missing.

2. If nums contains only one number, I need to check the ranges before and after that number.

3. If nums contains numbers that are consecutive, like [0,1,2,3], then there are no missing numbers between them, but I still need to check the edges with lower and upper.

4. If lower equals upper, and that number is in nums, then no missing numbers.

5. If lower equals upper, but that number is not in nums, then the missing range is just that number.

6. Handle negative numbers and zero.

7. Ensure that the range is inclusive, so lower and upper are inclusive.

Also, need to make sure that the output is sorted, which it should be since we're iterating through nums in order.

Formatting the output:

- If a range consists of a single number, like 2, output ""2""

- If a range has more than one number, like 4 to 49, output ""4->49""

So, I need a function to format the range based on whether the start and end are the same.

Let me think about the steps in code:

1. Initialize an empty list for the result.

2. Handle the case before the first number in nums:

a. If nums is not empty and nums[0] > lower, then add the range [lower, nums[0]-1] to the result.

3. Iterate through nums from the first to the second last number:

a. For each pair of consecutive numbers, if the difference is greater than 1, add the range [nums[i]+1, nums[i+1]-1] to the result.

4. Handle the case after the last number in nums:

a. If nums is not empty and nums[-1] < upper, then add the range [nums[-1]+1, upper] to the result.

5. Format each range in the result according to the rules.

6. Return the result list.

Now, think about how to implement this efficiently.

Given that nums is sorted and unique, and its length is up to 100, a simple linear scan should be efficient enough.

I need to be careful with integer overflow, but since Python handles big integers well, that shouldn't be an issue.

Also, need to ensure that lower and upper are within the constraints, but according to the constraints, they are between -10^9 and 10^9, which is manageable in Python.

Let me consider some examples to verify the logic.

Example 1:

nums = [0,1,3,50,75], lower = 0, upper = 99

- Before first number: nums[0] = 0, lower = 0 → no missing

- Between 0 and 1: no missing

- Between 1 and 3: missing 2

- Between 3 and 50: missing 4 to 49

- Between 50 and 75: missing 51 to 74

- After last number: 75 to 99: missing 76 to 99

So, missing ranges: [2], [4,49], [51,74], [76,99]

Formatted: [""2"", ""4->49"", ""51->74"", ""76->99""]

Example 2:

nums = [-1], lower = -1, upper = -1

- Before first number: nums[0] = -1, lower = -1 → no missing

- After last number: nums[-1] = -1, upper = -1 → no missing

So, no missing numbers, return []

Another example:

nums = [], lower = 1, upper = 5

- Before first number: nums is empty, so missing from lower to upper: [1,5]

- After last number: nums is empty, so no additional range

Formatted: [""1->5""]

Wait, but since nums is empty, all numbers from lower to upper are missing, so [""1->5""]

Another example:

nums = [2,3,4], lower = 1, upper = 5

- Before first number: nums[0] = 2, lower = 1 → missing 1

- Between 2 and 3: no missing

- Between 3 and 4: no missing

- After last number: nums[-1] = 4, upper = 5 → missing 5

So, missing ranges: [1], [5]

Formatted: [""1"", ""5""]

Another example:

nums = [0], lower = 0, upper = 0

- Before first number: nums[0] = 0, lower = 0 → no missing

- After last number: nums[-1] = 0, upper = 0 → no missing

So, no missing numbers, return []

Edge case:

nums = [0], lower = -1, upper = 1

- Before first number: nums[0] = 0, lower = -1 → missing -1

- After last number: nums[-1] = 0, upper = 1 → missing 1

So, missing ranges: [-1], [1]

Formatted: [""-1"", ""1""]

Another edge case:

nums = [1,3,5], lower = 0, upper = 6

- Before first number: nums[0] = 1, lower = 0 → missing 0

- Between 1 and 3: missing 2

- Between 3 and 5: missing 4

- After last number: nums[-1] = 5, upper = 6 → missing 6

So, missing ranges: [0], [2], [4], [6]

Formatted: [""0"", ""2"", ""4"", ""6""]

Seems straightforward.

Now, think about how to implement the formatting function.

I can define a function that takes start and end, and returns the string representation.

If start == end, return str(start)

Else, return str(start) + ""->"" + str(end)

Simple enough.

Now, need to handle the cases where nums is empty or has only one element.

If nums is empty, then simply add the range [lower, upper], formatted appropriately.

If nums has one element, handle the before and after ranges as described.

Also, need to make sure that the indices don't go out of bounds.

In code, I can iterate through nums with a loop, keeping track of the previous number.

Initialize prev to lower - 1 to handle the first range correctly.

Then, iterate through nums:

for num in nums:

if num - prev > 1:

add range [prev + 1, num - 1] to result

set prev to num

After the loop, handle the last range:

if upper - prev > 1:

add range [prev + 1, upper] to result

This way, I can capture all missing ranges.

Wait, but need to be careful with the initial value of prev.

If nums is empty, the loop won't run, and I need to add [lower, upper].

So, maybe handle the empty nums case separately.

Alternatively, set prev to lower -1, and start the loop.

If nums is empty, the loop won't run, and I'll add [lower, upper].

If nums is not empty, the loop will handle the ranges between numbers, and the final range after the last number.

Let me try this logic with the first example:

nums = [0,1,3,50,75], lower = 0, upper = 99

Set prev = -1

First num = 0:

0 - (-1) = 1, which is not >1, so no range added

Set prev = 0

Next num = 1:

1 - 0 = 1, no range

Set prev =1

Next num =3:

3 -1 =2 >1, so add [2,2], which is ""2""

Set prev=3

Next num=50:

50 -3=47>1, add [4,49], which is ""4->49""

Set prev=50

Next num=75:

75-50=25>1, add [51,74], which is ""51->74""

Set prev=75

After loop, check upper - prev =99 -75=24>1, add [76,99], which is ""76->99""

So, result is [""2"", ""4->49"", ""51->74"", ""76->99""]

Perfect.

Another test with nums=[], lower=1, upper=5

Set prev = -1

Loop doesn't run

After loop, upper - prev =5 - (-1)=6>1, add [0,5]

But wait, lower is 1, so should add [1,5]

Wait, prev is -1, upper is 5, so add [0,5], but lower is 1, so need to adjust.

Hmm, maybe setting prev to lower -1 is not perfect.

Alternatively, set prev to lower -1, and then in the loop, start from nums[0].

But in this case, nums is empty, so need to handle it differently.

Maybe I should check if nums is empty, then directly add [lower, upper], formatted.

Else, set prev to lower -1, and proceed as before.

This way, for empty nums, I add [lower, upper].

For non-empty nums, handle the before and between ranges as before, and the after range.

In the earlier example, nums=[], lower=1, upper=5

Add [1,5], which is ""1->5""

Another example: nums=[0], lower=0, upper=0

Set prev=-1

Num=0:

0 - (-1)=1, no range

Set prev=0

After loop, upper - prev =0 -0=0, don't add range

So, result is []

Good.

Another example: nums=[2,3,4], lower=1, upper=5

Set prev=0

Num=2:

2 -0=2>1, add [1,1], which is ""1""

Set prev=2

Num=3:

3-2=1, no range

Set prev=3

Num=4:

4-3=1, no range

Set prev=4

After loop, upper - prev=5-4=1>1, add [5,5], which is ""5""

So, result is [""1"",""5""]

Perfect.

Seems like setting prev=lower-1 works.

Wait, in the earlier case where nums=[], lower=1, upper=5

Set prev=0

After loop, upper - prev=5 -0=5>1, add [1,5]

Which is correct.

So, yes, setting prev=lower-1 seems to handle it correctly.

Now, think about potential error-prone parts.

1. Handling empty nums.

2. Handling single element in nums.

3. Ensuring that the ranges are correctly formatted.

4. Making sure that the ranges are inclusive.

5. Avoiding adding empty ranges.

6. Handling negative numbers and zero.

7. Ensuring that the output is sorted, which it should be since we're iterating through nums in order.

I need to make sure that the code doesn't add ranges where start > end.

For example, if nums=[0], lower=0, upper=0

prev=-1

num=0:

0 - (-1)=1, no range

prev=0

After loop, upper - prev=0 -0=0, don't add range

So, no issues.

Another case: nums=[1], lower=0, upper=1

prev= -1

num=1:

1 - (-1)=2>1, add [0,0], which is ""0""

prev=1

After loop, upper - prev=1 -1=0, don't add range

So, result is [""0""]

Correct.

Another case: nums=[0,2,4], lower=0, upper=5

prev=-1

num=0:

0 - (-1)=1, no range

prev=0

num=2:

2 -0=2>1, add [1,1], which is ""1""

prev=2

num=4:

4 -2=2>1, add [3,3], which is ""3""

prev=4

After loop, upper - prev=5 -4=1>1, add [5,5], which is ""5""

So, result is [""1"",""3"",""5""]

Correct.

Seems solid.

Now, think about implementing this in code.

I'll need:

- A function to format the range into the required string format.

- Iterate through nums with the logic described.

- Handle the edge cases correctly.

Also, need to make sure that the code is efficient, but since nums has up to 100 elements, efficiency isn't a big concern.

I should also consider the constraints on lower and upper, but in Python, handling large integers is fine.

Let me sketch the code structure.

Define a function missingRange(nums, lower, upper):

result = []

if not nums:

result.append(formatRange(lower, upper))

else:

prev = lower -1

for num in nums:

if num - prev >1:

result.append(formatRange(prev +1, num -1))

prev = num

if upper - prev >1:

result.append(formatRange(prev +1, upper))

return result

And define formatRange(start, end):

if start == end:

return str(start)

else:

return str(start) + ""->"" + str(end)

Let me test this with the first example.

nums = [0,1,3,50,75], lower=0, upper=99

not empty, so prev=-1

num=0: 0 - (-1)=1, no range

prev=0

num=1:1-0=1, no range

prev=1

num=3:3-1=2>1, add [2,2]->""2""

prev=3

num=50:50-3=47>1, add [4,49]->""4->49""

prev=50

num=75:75-50=25>1, add [51,74]->""51->74""

prev=75

after loop: 99-75=24>1, add [76,99]->""76->99""

result: [""2"",""4->49"",""51->74"",""76->99""]

Correct.

Another test: nums=[], lower=1, upper=5

empty, so add [1,5]->""1->5""

Correct.

Another test: nums=[0], lower=0, upper=0

not empty, prev=-1

num=0:0 - (-1)=1, no range

prev=0

after loop: 0-0=0, don't add

result: []

Correct.

Another test: nums=[2,3,4], lower=1, upper=5

not empty, prev=-1

num=2:2 - (-1)=3>1, add [0,1]

Wait, but lower is 1, so should add [1,1]

Wait, 2 - (-1)=3>1, add [0,1], but lower is 1, so start should be max(lower, prev+1)=1

Wait, in the code, start is prev+1, which is 0, but lower is 1, so need to ensure that start is not less than lower.

Ah, need to adjust the start to be max(lower, prev+1)

Similarly, end is min(upper, num-1)

So, in this case, start= max(1,0+1)=1, end=min(5,2-1)=1, so add [1,1]->""1""

Then, prev=2

num=3:3-2=1, no range

prev=3

num=4:4-3=1, no range

prev=4

after loop: 5-4=1>1, add [5,5]->""5""

result: [""1"",""5""]

Correct.

So, need to adjust the start and end to be within [lower, upper].

Modify the code:

if num - prev >1:

start = prev +1

end = num -1

start = max(start, lower)

end = min(end, upper)

if start <= end:

result.append(formatRange(start, end))

Similarly, in the after loop part:

if upper - prev >1:

start = prev +1

end = upper

if start <= end:

result.append(formatRange(start, end))

This ensures that the ranges don't go beyond lower and upper.

Another test: nums=[1,3,5], lower=0, upper=6

not empty, prev=-1

num=1:1 - (-1)=2>1, start=max(0,0)=0, end=min(6,0)=0, add [0,0]->""0""

prev=1

num=3:3-1=2>1, start=2, end=2, add [2,2]->""2""

prev=3

num=5:5-3=2>1, start=4, end=4, add [4,4]->""4""

prev=5

after loop: 6-5=1>1, start=6, end=6, add [6,6]->""6""

result: [""0"",""2"",""4"",""6""]

Correct.

Another test: nums=[0,1,2,3], lower=0, upper=3

not empty, prev=-1

num=0:0 - (-1)=1, no range

prev=0

num=1:1-0=1, no range

prev=1

num=2:2-1=1, no range

prev=2

num=3:3-2=1, no range

prev=3

after loop: 3-3=0, no range

result: []

Correct, since no numbers are missing.

Seems like the logic is sound.

Now, think about implementing this in code.

Define the formatRange function.

Then, in missingRange, handle the empty nums case separately.

Else, set prev to lower -1 and iterate through nums, adding ranges where the difference is greater than 1.

Finally, handle the range after the last number in nums.

Make sure to clamp the start and end to the lower and upper bounds.

Also, ensure that start <= end to avoid adding invalid ranges.

I think that's pretty much it.

I can proceed to write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find and list all missing numbers in a given range [lower, upper], excluding the numbers provided in a sorted unique integer array called `nums`. The result should be a list of ranges in a specific format.

### Approach

1. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - If `nums` is empty, the entire range [lower, upper] is missing.
   - If `nums` has elements, we need to check for missing numbers before the first element, between consecutive elements, and after the last element.

2. **Range Identification**:
   - Use a previous pointer initialized to `lower - 1` to compare with the first element in `nums`.
   - Iterate through `nums` and identify gaps between consecutive elements.
   - After the iteration, check for any missing numbers after the last element in `nums`.

3. **Range Formatting**:
   - For any identified gap, format the range appropriately.
   - If the start and end of a range are equal, represent it as a single number (e.g., ""2"").
   - If the range contains multiple numbers, represent it as ""start->end"" (e.g., ""4->49"").

    The algorithm first finds the minimum and maximum values of the input array `nums`. Then it calculates the ideal bucket size by dividing the difference between the maximum and minimum values by the length of the array minus one. The algorithm then initializes an array of buckets, where each bucket contains the minimum and maximum values of its elements.

Next, the algorithm updates the minimum and maximum values for each bucket appropriately by iterating through the input array. Finally, the algorithm calculates the maximum gap by finding the difference between the minimum value of the current bucket and the maximum value of the previous non-empty bucket, and updating the maximum gap value accordingly.

This algorithm runs in linear time, because it iterates through the input array once to fill the buckets, and then it iterates through the buckets once to compute the maximum gap. It also uses linear extra space, as the number of buckets is proportional to the length of the input array.

John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","I've got this problem to compare two version numbers, version1 and version2, and I need to return -1 if version1 is less than version2, 1 if it's greater, and 0 if they're equal. The versions are strings that contain numbers separated by dots, like ""1.01"" and ""1.001"", and I have to compare them revision by revision.

First, I need to understand how to break down these version strings into their respective revisions. Since revisions are separated by dots, I can split the strings by the dot character to get lists of revisions for each version.

For example, if version1 is ""1.01"" and version2 is ""1.001"", splitting by '.' would give me:

- version1_revisions = [""1"", ""01""]

- version2_revisions = [""1"", ""001""]

Now, I need to compare these revisions one by one from left to right. The problem states that revisions are compared based on their integer value, ignoring any leading zeros. So, ""01"" and ""001"" should both be treated as the integer 1.

Therefore, in this case, both revisions are equal (1 == 1), so the overall versions are equal, and I should return 0.

Another example is version1 = ""1.0"" and version2 = ""1.0.0"". Splitting these gives:

- version1_revisions = [""1"", ""0""]

- version2_revisions = [""1"", ""0"", ""0""]

Here, the first two revisions are the same, but version2 has an extra revision ""0"". Since revisions not specified in version1 are considered as ""0"", version1 is effectively ""1.0.0"", which is equal to version2. So, I should return 0.

In the case where version1 = ""0.1"" and version2 = ""1.1"":

- version1_revisions = [""0"", ""1""]

- version2_revisions = [""1"", ""1""]

Comparing the first revision, 0 < 1, so version1 is less than version2, and I should return -1.

From these examples, I can outline a step-by-step approach:

1. Split both version strings by '.' to get lists of revisions.

2. Compare revisions one by one from left to right.

3. Convert each revision to an integer to ignore leading zeros.

4. If one version has more revisions than the other, treat the missing revisions as 0.

5. Return -1 if version1 is smaller, 1 if it's larger, and 0 if they are equal.

Now, to implement this in Python, I can follow these steps in code.

First, split the versions:

version1_revisions = version1.split('.')

version2_revisions = version2.split('.')

Then, iterate through the revisions. To handle cases where one list is longer than the other, I can iterate up to the length of the longer list, treating missing revisions as 0.

I can use `zip` with a fillvalue of 0 to pair revisions from both lists, even if one is shorter.

For example:

from itertools import zip_longest

for rev1, rev2 in zip_longest(version1_revisions, version2_revisions, fillvalue='0'):

    # Convert revisions to integers

    int_rev1 = int(rev1)

    int_rev2 = int(rev2)

    # Compare the integer values

    if int_rev1 < int_rev2:

        return -1

    elif int_rev1 > int_rev2:

        return 1

# If all revisions are equal, return 0

return 0

This seems straightforward. Let's test this logic with the earlier examples.

Test case 1:

version1 = ""1.01""

version2 = ""1.001""

Split:

version1_revisions = [""1"", ""01""]

version2_revisions = [""1"", ""001""]

Zip together:

(""1"", ""1"") -> 1 == 1

(""01"", ""001"") -> 1 == 1

All revisions are equal, so return 0. Correct.

Test case 2:

version1 = ""1.0""

version2 = ""1.0.0""

Split:

version1_revisions = [""1"", ""0""]

version2_revisions = [""1"", ""0"", ""0""]

Zip together with fillvalue '0':

(""1"", ""1"") -> 1 == 1

(""0"", ""0"") -> 0 == 0

No more revisions in version1, so treat as 0:

(""0"", ""0"") -> 0 == 0

All revisions are equal, so return 0. Correct.

Test case 3:

version1 = ""0.1""

version2 = ""1.1""

Split:

version1_revisions = [""0"", ""1""]

version2_revisions = [""1"", ""1""]

Zip together:

(""0"", ""1"") -> 0 < 1

Return -1. Correct.

Another test case:

version1 = ""1.1.3""

version2 = ""1.1.5""

Split:

version1_revisions = [""1"", ""1"", ""3""]

version2_revisions = [""1"", ""1"", ""5""]

Zip together:

(""1"", ""1"") -> equal

(""1"", ""1"") -> equal

(""3"", ""5"") -> 3 < 5

Return -1. Correct.

Edge case:

version1 = ""1""

version2 = ""1.0""

Split:

version1_revisions = [""1""]

version2_revisions = [""1"", ""0""]

Zip together with fillvalue '0':

(""1"", ""1"") -> equal

No more revisions in version1, treat as 0:

(""0"", ""0"") -> equal

Return 0. Correct, because ""1"" is equivalent to ""1.0"".

Another edge case:

version1 = ""7.5.2.4""

version2 = ""7.5.3""

Split:

version1_revisions = [""7"", ""5"", ""2"", ""4""]

version2_revisions = [""7"", ""5"", ""3""]

Zip together:

(""7"", ""7"") -> equal

(""5"", ""5"") -> equal

(""2"", ""3"") -> 2 < 3

Return -1. Correct.

One more edge case:

version1 = ""1.0.1""

version2 = ""1""

Split:

version1_revisions = [""1"", ""0"", ""1""]

version2_revisions = [""1""]

Zip together with fillvalue '0':

(""1"", ""1"") -> equal

Return 1. Correct, because ""1.0.1"" is greater than ""1"".

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to compare two version numbers, `version1` and `version2`, and determine their relational order. Version numbers are composed of revisions separated by dots, and revisions may contain leading zeros.

### Approach
1. **Split the Version Strings**: Split `version1` and `version2` by the dot character to obtain lists of revisions.
2. **Compare Revisions**: Iterate through the revisions of both versions simultaneously. Convert each revision to an integer to ignore leading zeros and compare them.
3. **Handle Different Lengths**: If one version has more revisions than the other, consider the missing revisions as 0 for comparison.
4. **Return the Result**: Return -1 if `version1` is smaller, 1 if it is larger, and 0 if they are equal based on their revision integers.

The task is to convert a fraction, given by a numerator and a denominator, into its decimal representation as a string. If the fractional part is repeating, I need to enclose the repeating part in parentheses.

First, I need to handle both positive and negative numbers, so I should consider the sign of the result based on the signs of the numerator and denominator.

Let's start by determining the sign of the result. If both the numerator and denominator are positive or both are negative, the result is positive. If only one of them is negative, the result is negative.

I can use the formula:

`sign = -1 if (numerator < 0) ^ (denominator < 0) else 1`

Then, I can make both numerator and denominator positive for simplicity.

Next, I need to handle the integer part and the fractional part separately.

The integer part is simply the absolute value of the numerator divided by the absolute value of the denominator.

For the fractional part, I need to perform the division of the remainder (numerator % denominator) by the denominator and collect the digits until the remainder repeats or becomes zero.

I need to keep track of the remainders I've seen so far and the position at which each remainder occurs in the fractional part. When a remainder repeats, it indicates the start of the repeating sequence.

Here's a rough plan:

1. Determine the sign of the result.

2. Make both numerator and denominator positive.

3. Compute the integer part.

4. Initialize the fractional part as an empty string.

5. Initialize a dictionary to store remainders and their corresponding positions in the fractional part.

6. Initialize an index to track the position in the fractional part.

7. While the remainder is not zero and has not been seen before:

a. Multiply the remainder by 10.

b. Compute the digit to add to the fractional part.

c. Compute the new remainder.

d. If the new remainder has been seen before, insert parentheses around the repeating part.

e. Otherwise, store the position of the current remainder.

8. If the fractional part is not empty, prepend the decimal point to it.

9. Combine the integer part, the sign, and the fractional part, and return the result.

I need to be careful with edge cases, such as when the denominator is 1, or when the numerator is 0.

Also, I need to ensure that the result string does not exceed 10^4 characters, but according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that it won't.

I need to find two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a specific target. The array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and I have to return the indices of these two numbers. Oh, and the indices are 1-based, not 0-based, which is a bit unusual.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have an array of integers that's sorted, and I need to find two distinct numbers that add up to a given target. There's exactly one solution, and I can't use the same element twice. Also, I must use only constant extra space.

Let me look at the examples to get a better grasp.

In the first example:

numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9

The output is [1,2] because 2 + 7 = 9, and their 1-based indices are 1 and 2.

In the second example:

numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6

The output is [1,3] because 2 + 4 = 6, and their indices are 1 and 3.

In the third example:

numbers = [-1,0], target = -1

The output is [1,2] because -1 + 0 = -1, and their indices are 1 and 2.

So, it seems straightforward. I need to find a pair whose sum is equal to the target.

Now, since the array is sorted, I can think of using a two-pointer approach. I can have one pointer at the beginning of the array and another at the end. Then, I can check the sum of the numbers at these two pointers.

If the sum is equal to the target, I've found my pair. If the sum is less than the target, I need a larger sum, so I can move the left pointer to the right. If the sum is greater than the target, I need a smaller sum, so I can move the right pointer to the left.

I should continue this process until I find the pair or the pointers meet.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Initialize two pointers, left and right. Left starts at the beginning (index 0), and right starts at the end (index numbers.length - 1).

2. While left < right:

a. Calculate the sum of numbers[left] and numbers[right].

b. If sum == target, return [left+1, right+1] since indices are 1-based.

c. If sum < target, increment left (left++).

d. If sum > target, decrement right (right--).

3. If no such pair is found, return an empty array or raise an error, but according to the problem, there is exactly one solution, so I don't need to handle the case where no solution exists.

This approach seems efficient because it runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the array, and it uses constant extra space, which satisfies the constraints.

Let me test this logic with the first example:

numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9

- Initialize left = 0, right = 3

- Sum = 2 + 15 = 17, which is greater than 9, so move right to 2

- Now, sum = 2 + 11 = 13, still greater than 9, move right to 1

- Sum = 2 + 7 = 9, which is the target. Return [1,2]

Perfect.

Let's try the second example:

numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6

- left = 0, right = 2

- Sum = 2 + 4 = 6, which is the target. Return [1,3]

Good.

Third example:

numbers = [-1,0], target = -1

- left = 0, right = 1

- Sum = -1 + 0 = -1, which is the target. Return [1,2]

Works.

Seems like this approach is solid.

Wait a minute, I should consider if there are duplicates in the array. The problem says the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, so duplicates are possible. But since there's exactly one solution, I don't need to worry about multiple possible pairs.

Also, I should make sure that I don't use the same element twice. But since I'm using two distinct pointers, that shouldn't be an issue.

Another thing to consider is the range of numbers. The problem says numbers[i] can be from -1000 to 1000, and the target can also be from -1000 to 1000. So, I need to make sure that my approach handles negative numbers correctly, which it should, since addition works the same way regardless of sign.

Edge cases to think about:

- The array has exactly two elements, which add up to the target.

- The array has multiple elements, and the two numbers are at the beginning or the end.

- The array has negative and positive numbers.

I should also consider the performance. The array can have up to 3 * 10^4 elements, and since my approach is O(n), it should be efficient enough.

Let me think about an array with all negative numbers.

numbers = [-3, -2, -1], target = -3

Possible pairs:

-3 + (-1) = -4

-3 + (-2) = -5

-2 + (-1) = -3 → indices 2 and 3 (1-based)

So, the output should be [2,3]

Let's simulate the two-pointer approach:

- left = 0, right = 2

- Sum = -3 + (-1) = -4, which is less than -3, so move left to 1

- Now, sum = -2 + (-1) = -3, which is the target. Return [2,3]

Correct.

Another edge case:

numbers = [0,0,0,0,0], target = 0

Since there's exactly one solution, it must be a pair of indices that add up to 0. But all pairs will add up to 0. However, the problem states there's exactly one solution, so perhaps this case is not possible. Maybe all elements are zero, but the target is zero, and I need to find any one pair. But according to the problem, there is exactly one solution, so I don't need to worry about multiple possible pairs.

Wait, the problem says there is exactly one solution, so I don't need to handle cases where there might be multiple solutions or no solution.

Another thing to consider is that the array is sorted, so if I use the two-pointer approach, I don't need to sort it again, which saves time.

I should also think about the space complexity. Since I'm only using a constant amount of extra space for the pointers and the sum, it meets the requirement of using only constant extra space.

I think this approach is solid. I'll proceed to implement it in Python.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a specific target and return their 1-based indices.

### Approach
1. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` starting at the beginning (index 0) and `right` starting at the end (index `len(numbers)-1`) of the array.
   - Calculate the sum of the elements at these pointers.
   - If the sum is equal to the target, return their 1-based indices.
   - If the sum is less than the target, move the `left` pointer to the right to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer to the left to decrease the sum.
   - Continue this process until the pointers meet or the correct pair is found.

This approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) because each pointer moves at most n steps, and it uses constant extra space as required.

    The algorithm converts an integer `columnNumber` to its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet. It does so by treating the Excel sheet column headers as a Base-26 number system where the numbers are represented by the characters from A-Z.

1. We start by initializing an empty string called `result` that will store the final column title.
2. In a while loop, we continue until the `columnNumber` is greater than 0.
3. We subtract 1 from `columnNumber`, as the base representation starts from A (1).
4. The remainder of `columnNumber` divided by 26 is the index of the character in the A-Z range, which is added to the `result` string.
5. `columnNumber` is then divided by 26 and the loop continues until `columnNumber` is 0.
6. Once the loop is finished, the `result` string is returned as the corresponding column title.

This problem can be thought of as converting a decimal number into a base-26 number system, where each digit is represented by an alphabet letter from 'A' to 'Z'. However, there's a twist: in base-26, the letters 'A' to 'Z' correspond to 1 to 26, respectively, and there is no zero.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We'll use a list to build the column title since strings are immutable in Python, and building a string character by character is more efficient using lists.
   - We'll use the formula to convert the column number to its corresponding letters.

2. **Conversion Logic**:
   - While the `columnNumber` is greater than 0:
     - Subtract 1 from `columnNumber` to adjust for the 1-based indexing (since 'A' corresponds to 1, not 0).
     - Calculate the remainder when `columnNumber` is divided by 26.
     - Use this remainder to find the corresponding letter and prepend it to the result list.
     - Update `columnNumber` to the quotient of the division.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle the case where `columnNumber` is 0 after subtraction.
   - Ensure that the function works for the maximum value of `columnNumber`, which is 2^31 - 1.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The algorithm runs in O(log n) time complexity, where n is the `columnNumber`, because in each iteration, the `columnNumber` is reduced by a factor of 26.

One straightforward way to solve this is by using a hash map to count the occurrences of each element in the array. Here's how it would work:

1. Initialize an empty hash map.
2. Iterate through each element in the array.
3. For each element, if it's already in the hash map, increment its count.
4. If it's not in the hash map, add it with a count of 1.
5. After processing all elements, iterate through the hash map to find the element with a count greater than ⌊n/2⌋.

This approach works well and is easy to understand. However, it requires additional space for the hash map, which might not be ideal if we're concerned about space complexity.

### Approach 2: Sorting

Another approach is to sort the array first. Since the majority element appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times, it must be the element at the midpoint of the sorted array.

Here's why:

- If an element appears more than half the times in the array, it will necessarily occupy the middle position when the array is sorted.

So, the steps would be:

1. Sort the array.
2. Return the element at index floor(n/2).

This approach is simple and efficient in terms of space, as sorting can be done in-place in most languages. However, the time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, which might not be optimal if n is large.

### Approach 3: Moore's Voting Algorithm

There's a more efficient linear time algorithm called Moore's Voting Algorithm that can solve this problem in O(n) time and O(1) space. This algorithm is based on the principle that if we cancel out each occurrence of an element e with all other elements that are different from e, e will still be left if it is a majority element.

Here's how it works:

1. Initialize a variable `candidate` to store the potential candidate for majority element and a counter `count` to 0.
2. Iterate through each element in the array:
   - If `count` is 0, set the current element as `candidate` and set `count` to 1.
   - If the current element is the same as `candidate`, increment `count`.
   - If the current element is different from `candidate`, decrement `count`.
3. After the iteration, `candidate` will be the majority element.

The algorithm works because if there is a majority element, it will always be the last remaining candidate after all cancellations.

### Solution Code

Here's the Python code implementing Moore's Voting Algorithm:","python
def majorityElement(nums):
    count = 0
    candidate = None

    for num in nums:
        if count == 0:
            candidate = num
            count = 1
        elif num == candidate:
            count += 1
        else:
            count -= 1
    return candidate","**Reasoning Score: 5**

I need to design a data structure that can accept a stream of integers and check if there's any pair of integers that sum up to a specific value. It's called the ""TwoSum"" class, and it has to do three things:

1. Initialize with an empty array.

2. Add numbers to the data structure.

3. Find if there's any pair that adds up to a given value.

Okay, so first, I need to think about how to store the numbers efficiently. Since numbers are coming in a stream, I probably want something that allows quick additions and quick checks for the sum.

Let me consider using a list or an array to store the numbers. Adding numbers would be straightforward, just append them to the list. But checking for a pair that sums up to a specific value could be time-consuming if the list is large because I'd have to check all possible pairs, which would be O(n^2) in the worst case. That's not efficient, especially since the constraints mention up to 10^4 calls to add and find, which could lead to poor performance.

Is there a better way? Maybe I can use a hash table to store the numbers and their frequencies. That way, for each number, I can check if the complement (value - number) exists in the hash table. This should be faster, closer to O(1) for lookups.

Let me think about that. I'll store each number in a hash table, and for each find operation, I'll iterate through the numbers and check if the complement exists in the hash table. But I need to be careful with duplicates. If the complement is the same as the number itself, I need to ensure there are at least two instances of that number in the hash table.

Wait, the constraints allow for duplicates, since numbers are added via the add method, and the numbers can be between -10^5 and 10^5.

So, I'll use a dictionary where the keys are the numbers and the values are the counts of each number.

When adding a number, I'll just increment its count in the dictionary.

When finding a pair for a given value, I'll iterate through the numbers and for each number, calculate the complement (value - number). Then, check if the complement exists in the dictionary.

If the complement is different from the number, I just need to check if it exists in the dictionary with at least one count.

If the complement is the same as the number, I need to ensure that there are at least two instances of that number in the dictionary.

This seems efficient because dictionary lookups are O(1) on average, and since I'm iterating through the numbers, the find operation would be O(n).

Given that n can be up to 10^4, this should be acceptable.

But is there a way to make the find operation even faster? Maybe O(1)?

Well, if I precompute all possible sums when adding a number, but that would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

Alternatively, maybe I can store all possible sums in a set, but again, that would require a lot of storage and time to insert all those sums.

No, that's not practical.

So, sticking with the hash table approach seems reasonable.

Let me try to outline the steps again:

- Initialization: Create an empty dictionary to store numbers and their counts.

- Add method: Take a number and increment its count in the dictionary.

- Find method: Take a value, iterate through the numbers in the dictionary, calculate the complement for each number, and check if the complement exists in the dictionary with sufficient counts.

I should also consider the constraints:

- Numbers can be between -10^5 and 10^5.

- Values can be between -2^31 and 2^31 - 1.

- Up to 10^4 calls to add and find.

I need to make sure that my implementation handles large inputs efficiently.

Also, since numbers can be negative, I need to ensure that the complement calculation handles negative values correctly, which it should, as it's just value - number.

Let me think about some edge cases:

1. Adding the same number multiple times, and then searching for a sum that requires two instances of that number.

   For example:

   - Add 1

   - Add 1

   - Find 2 → Should return true because 1 + 1 = 2.

   So, I need to check if the complement exists and if it's the same as the number, ensure there are at least two counts.

2. Adding a mix of positive and negative numbers, and searching for a sum that requires a specific pair.

   For example:

   - Add 1

   - Add -1

   - Find 0 → Should return true because 1 + (-1) = 0.

3. Adding a number and searching for a sum that doesn't exist.

   For example:

   - Add 1

   - Find 3 → Should return false because there's no pair that sums to 3.

4. Adding multiple numbers and searching for a sum that can be formed in multiple ways.

   For example:

   - Add 1

   - Add 2

   - Add 3

   - Find 4 → Should return true because 1 + 3 = 4.

5. Searching before any numbers are added.

   - Find 0 → Should return false because there are no numbers.

   I need to handle the case where the dictionary is empty in the find method.

6. Adding a large number of elements and ensuring that the performance is acceptable.

   Given the constraints, with up to 10^4 additions and finds, the O(n) find operation should be fine, but I need to make sure that the implementation is optimized.

I should also consider the data types. Since values can be as large as 2^31 - 1, which is beyond the range of 32-bit integers, I need to ensure that the programming language can handle large integers, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's not an issue.

Now, let's think about the implementation in Python.

I'll use a dictionary to store the counts of each number.

In the add method, I'll increment the count of the number in the dictionary.

In the find method, I'll iterate through the numbers in the dictionary. For each number, calculate the complement as value - number. Then:

- If the complement is not equal to the number, check if the complement exists in the dictionary with at least one count.

- If the complement is equal to the number, check if the count of that number is at least two.

- If any such pair is found, return True; otherwise, return False after checking all numbers.

Wait, but iterating through all numbers in the dictionary for each find operation could be inefficient if there are many numbers.

Is there a way to optimize this further?

Alternatively, maybe I can iterate through the numbers and check for complements without iterating through the entire dictionary each time.

But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Let me consider another approach: sorting the numbers and using two pointers.

If I sort the numbers, I can use a two-pointer technique to find if there's a pair that sums to the value.

This would require sorting the numbers each time or maintaining a sorted list, which could be inefficient for additions.

Wait, but if I maintain a sorted list, additions would be O(log n) for inserting in the correct position, and finding would be O(n) with two pointers.

But with up to 10^4 additions and finds, this might not be efficient enough, as maintaining a sorted list during additions could be time-consuming.

Comparing this to the hash table approach, where additions are O(1) and finds are O(n), the hash table seems better.

Therefore, I'll stick with the hash table approach.

Let me try to implement this in Python.

First, initialize the dictionary in the constructor:","python

I need to convert an Excel column title into its corresponding column number. For example, ""A"" is 1, ""B"" is 2, up to ""Z"" which is 26. Then ""AA"" is 27, ""AB"" is 28, and so on. The problem also mentions that the input will be uppercase English letters and the length of the string won't exceed 7 characters.

First, I need to understand how Excel names its columns. It's similar to a base-26 numbering system, but with a couple of key differences. In base-26, each position represents a power of 26, and each digit can be from 0 to 25. However, in Excel's system, the letters correspond to 1 through 26, with ""A"" being 1, ""B"" being 2,..., ""Z"" being 26. There is no zero, and it's a little different from standard base conversion because of this offset.

Let me think about how to approach this. If I have a single letter, like ""A"", it's straightforward: it's just 1. For two letters, like ""AB"", it's ""A"" (1) times 26 plus ""B"" (2), which gives 28. Similarly, ""AA"" is ""A"" (1) times 26 plus ""A"" (1), which is 27.

So, in general, for a string of length n, the column number is calculated by taking each character, converting it to its corresponding numerical value (A=1, B=2,..., Z=26), and then multiplying it by 26 raised to the power of its position from the right, starting from 0.

For example, in ""ABC"":

- 'C' is in position 0: C (3) * 26^0 = 3 * 1 = 3

- 'B' is in position 1: B (2) * 26^1 = 2 * 26 = 52

- 'A' is in position 2: A (1) * 26^2 = 1 * 676 = 676

- Total: 3 + 52 + 676 = 729

Wait, but according to Excel, ""ABC"" should be 731. Let me check:

- A = 1

- AB = 28

- ABC = 28 * 26 + 3 = 728 + 3 = 731

Hmm, so there's a discrepancy here. According to my earlier method, ""ABC"" would be 729, but according to Excel, it should be 731. I must have made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate ""ABC"" properly:

- 'C' is the rightmost character: C (3) * 26^0 = 3

- 'B' is the next one: B (2) * 26^1 = 52

- 'A' is the leftmost: A (1) * 26^2 = 676

- Sum: 3 + 52 + 676 = 731

Yes, that matches. I must have added incorrectly earlier. So the general formula is:

\[
\text{column number} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (\text{value of } s[n-1 - i]) \times 26^i
\]

where \(s\) is the column title string, and \(\text{value of } s[j]\) is the numerical value of the character at position \(j\) (A=1, B=2,..., Z=26).

Now, to implement this in Python, I need to:

1. Reverse the string or iterate from the end to the beginning.

2. For each character, get its numerical value (A=1, B=2,..., Z=26).

3. Multiply this value by 26 raised to the power of its position index.

4. Sum all these values to get the final column number.

I need to handle strings of up to 7 characters in length, but since the constraint is small, performance shouldn't be an issue.

Let me think about how to get the numerical value of a character. In Python, the ord() function returns the ASCII value of a character. For uppercase letters, 'A' has ord('A') = 65, 'B' = 66,..., 'Z' = 90. So, to get the value from 1 to 26, I can do ord(char) - ord('A') + 1.

For example:

- ord('A') - ord('A') + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1

- ord('B') - ord('A') + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2

-...

- ord('Z') - ord('A') + 1 = 25 + 1 = 26

That seems correct.

Now, for the implementation, I can initialize a variable, say, column_number to 0. Then, for each character in the string, from left to right, I can multiply the current column_number by 26 and add the value of the next character.

Wait, that's even simpler. It's similar to converting a number from base 26, where each digit is represented by a letter.

So, in code, it would look like:

column_number = 0

for char in columnTitle:

column_number = column_number * 26 + (ord(char) - ord('A') + 1)

return column_number

Let me test this with ""A"": 0*26 + 1 = 1 → correct

""AB"": 0*26 + 1 = 1 → 1*26 + 2 = 28 → correct

""ABC"": 0*26 + 1 = 1 → 1*26 + 2 = 28 → 28*26 + 3 = 731 → correct

""ZY"": 0*26 + 26 = 26 → 26*26 + 25 = 676 + 25 = 701 → matches the example

Seems correct.

Alternatively, I could iterate from the end, calculating each character's value multiplied by 26 raised to its position index.

For example, in ""ABC"":

- 'C' * 26^0 = 3 * 1 = 3

- 'B' * 26^1 = 2 * 26 = 52

- 'A' * 26^2 = 1 * 676 = 676

- Sum: 3 + 52 + 676 = 731

In code, that would be something like:

column_number = 0

power = 1

for char in reversed(columnTitle):

column_number += (ord(char) - ord('A') + 1) * power

power *= 26

return column_number

This should also work.

Between the two approaches, the first one is perhaps a bit simpler, as it doesn't require managing the power variable explicitly.

Let me consider edge cases:

1. Single character: ""A"" → 1, ""Z"" → 26

2. Two characters: ""AA"" → 27, ""AZ"" → 52, ""BA"" → 53

3. Longer strings: ""AAA"" → 703, ""ZZZ"" → 18278

Wait, let's calculate ""ZZZ"":

- Z = 26

- Z * 26^0 = 26 * 1 = 26

- Z * 26^1 = 26 * 26 = 676

- Z * 26^2 = 26 * 676 = 17576

- Sum: 26 + 676 + 17576 = 18278

Yes, that seems correct.

Another edge case is the maximum input length, which is 7 characters. The problem states that the input will not exceed 7 characters and is within the range ""A"" to ""FXSHRXW"". Let's check ""FXSHRXW"":

- F = 6

- X = 24

- S = 19

- H = 8

- R = 18

- X = 24

- W = 23

So, column_number = 6*(26^6) + 24*(26^5) + 19*(26^4) + 8*(26^3) + 18*(26^2) + 24*(26^1) + 23*(26^0)

Calculating this:

- 6*(26^6) = 6*308915776 = 1853494656

- 24*(26^5) = 24*11881376 = 285153024

- 19*(26^4) = 19*456976 = 8682544

- 8*(26^3) = 8*17576 = 140608

- 18*(26^2) = 18*676 = 12168

- 24*(26^1) = 24*26 = 624

- 23*(26^0) = 23*1 = 23

Sum: 1853494656 + 285153024 + 8682544 + 140608 + 12168 + 624 + 23 = 2,145,283,647

Wait, but the problem constraints mention that the columnTitle is within [""A"", ""FXSHRXW""], so I need to ensure that the function can handle this range correctly.

Given that the maximum possible column number is for ""FXSHRXW"", which is 2,145,283,647, I need to make sure that Python can handle integers of this size, which it can, as Python has no problem with large integers.

Another consideration is the length of the string. The problem states that the length is between 1 and 7, inclusive, so I don't need to worry about shorter or longer strings.

Also, the problem specifies that the string consists only of uppercase English letters, so I don't need to handle lowercase letters or non-letter characters.

Let me think about the implementation again. The straightforward way is to iterate through each character, convert it to its numerical value, and build the column number by multiplying the current result by 26 and adding the next value.

Here's a rough draft of the function:

def titleToNumber(columnTitle: str) -> int:

result = 0

for char in columnTitle:

value = ord(char) - ord('A') + 1

result = result * 26 + value

return result

This seems concise and efficient. Let me test it with some examples.

Test case 1:

Input: ""A""

Expected Output: 1

Calculation: 0*26 + 1 = 1 → correct

Test case 2:

Input: ""AB""

Expected Output: 28

Calculation: 0*26 + 1 = 1 → 1*26 + 2 = 28 → correct

Test case 3:

Input: ""ZY""

Expected Output: 701

Calculation: 0*26 + 26 = 26 → 26*26 + 25 = 676 + 25 = 701 → correct

Test case 4:

Input: ""AAA""

Expected Output: 703

Calculation: 0*26 + 1 = 1 → 1*26 + 1 = 27 → 27*26 + 1 = 703 → correct

Test case 5:

Input: ""ZZZ""

Expected Output: 18278

Calculation: 0*26 + 26 = 26 → 26*26 + 26 = 676 + 26 = 702 → 702*26 + 26 = 18252 + 26 = 18278 → correct

Seems like it works for these cases.

I should also consider the maximum input, ""FXSHRXW"":

Calculation:

F = 6

X = 24

S = 19

H = 8

R = 18

X = 24

W = 23

Applying the function:

Start with result = 0

1. 'F': result = 0*26 + 6 = 6

2. 'X': result = 6*26 + 24 = 156 + 24 = 180

3. 'S': result = 180*26 + 19 = 4680 + 19 = 4699

4. 'H': result = 4699*26 + 8 = 122174 + 8 = 122182

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to convert an Excel column title into its corresponding column number. Excel columns are titled starting from ""A"" to ""Z"", then ""AA"", ""AB"", etc., which corresponds to numbers starting from 1 onwards. This is similar to converting a base-26 number to a base-10 number, but with a slight difference since the base starts from 1 instead of 0.

### Approach
1. Initialize a variable `column_number` to 0, which will store the final column number.
2. Iterate through each character in the `columnTitle` string.
3. For each character:
   - Convert the character to its corresponding numerical value ('A' -> 1, 'B' -> 2,..., 'Z' -> 26). This is done using `ord(char) - ord('A') + 1`.
   - Multiply the current `column_number` by 26 and add the numerical value of the current character.
4. Return the final `column_number`.

This approach effectively converts the Excel column title to its corresponding column number by treating the title as a base-26 number with a slight adjustment for the starting value.

### Solution Code","python

    column_number = 0

We know there are plenty of even factors in a factorial, so we just need to count how many times the factor 5 appears.

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that works in logarithmic time complexity? Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","So I've got this problem: I need to find out how many trailing zeros there are in the factorial of a number n. For those who might not remember, factorial means multiplying all positive integers up to n. So, 5! is 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120, and as you can see, there's one trailing zero in 120.

The task is to find the number of these trailing zeros without actually calculating the factorial, which can get really big, really fast.

First, I need to understand what causes trailing zeros in a number. Trailing zeros are created by factors of 10 in the number, and since 10 is 2 × 5, each pair of 2 and 5 in the factorial's prime factors will give us a trailing zero.

So, in n!, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product, which is essentially the minimum of the number of 2s and the number of 5s in the prime factorization of n!.

But, in reality, there are usually more 2s than 5s in the factorization because there are more even numbers than multiples of 5. Therefore, the number of 5s will be the limiting factor.

Wait, actually, I think that's not entirely accurate. While it's true that there are more even numbers than multiples of 5, I need to think about how many times each prime factor appears in the entire factorial.

Let me think about it step by step.

Take n = 5:

5! = 120 = 2^3 × 3 × 5

Here, there are three 2s, one 3, and one 5. So, the number of 10s I can make is limited by the number of 5s, which is one. So, one trailing zero.

n = 10:

10! = 3,628,800

Let's factorize it:

10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1

= (2 × 5) × (3^2) × (2^3) × 7 × (2 × 3) × 5 × (2^2) × 3 × 2 × 1

Counting the primes:

- 2s: 8 times (from 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

- 3s: 4 times (from 3, 6, 9)

- 5s: 2 times (from 5, 10)

- 7: 1 time

So, 2^8 × 3^4 × 5^2 × 7^1

Each 10 requires one 2 and one 5. So, the number of 10s is limited by the smaller of the exponents of 2 and 5, which is 2.

Therefore, there are two trailing zeros in 10!.

Wait, but in reality, 10! is 3,628,800, which indeed has two trailing zeros.

So, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of 5s in the prime factorization of n!.

But, hold on, in the case of 10!, there are two 5s, and two trailing zeros. Seems straightforward.

But let's check for n = 25.

n = 25:

Factorials involve multiples of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25. Notably, 25 is 5^2, so it contributes two 5s.

So, the number of 5s is:

- Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 → 5 numbers

- But 25 contributes an extra 5, so total 5s are 6.

Therefore, 25! should have six trailing zeros.

But wait, let's see:

25! = 15,511,210,043,330,985,984,000,000

Count the trailing zeros: 6 zeros.

Yes, it matches.

So, the general approach is to count the number of times 5 appears in the prime factorization of n!.

But, I need to be careful because some numbers like 25 contribute more than one 5.

So, how do I count the total number of 5s in the factorization of n!?

I can count the multiples of 5 in n, which is n//5.

But, numbers like 25, 125, etc., contribute additional 5s.

So, I need to account for higher powers of 5.

Therefore, the total number of 5s is:

floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) +...

Keep dividing n by increasing powers of 5 and sum the integer divisions until the division result is zero.

This makes sense because:

- floor(n/5) counts the multiples of 5

- floor(n/25) counts the multiples of 25, which contribute an extra 5 each

- floor(n/125) counts the multiples of 125, which contribute yet another 5, and so on.

Let's test this with n = 25:

floor(25/5) = 5

floor(25/25) = 1

floor(25/125) = 0

Total: 5 + 1 + 0 = 6, which matches.

Another test: n = 125

floor(125/5) = 25

floor(125/25) = 5

floor(125/125) = 1

floor(125/625) = 0

Total: 25 + 5 + 1 = 31

So, 125! should have 31 trailing zeros.

Seems correct.

Now, what about n = 0 or n = 1?

n = 0: 0! is defined as 1, which has no trailing zeros.

n = 1: 1! = 1, no trailing zeros.

n = 5: floor(5/5) = 1, floor(5/25) = 0 → total 1, which matches.

n = 6: floor(6/5) = 1, floor(6/25) = 0 → total 1

6! = 720, which has one trailing zero. Correct.

n = 11:

floor(11/5) = 2

floor(11/25) = 0

Total: 2

11! = 39,916,800, which has two trailing zeros. Correct.

Seems like this approach works.

Now, to implement this in code, I can write a function that iteratively divides n by 5 and sums up the integer divisions, then divides by 25, and so on, until the division result is zero.

Let me sketch this out.

Initialize count = 0

Set divisor = 5

While n >= divisor:

count += n // divisor

divisor *= 5

Return count

Let's test this with n = 25:

divisor = 5, count += 5, count = 5

divisor = 25, count += 1, count = 6

divisor = 125, which is > 25, stop.

Total count = 6, correct.

n = 125:

divisor = 5, count += 25, count = 25

divisor = 25, count += 5, count = 30

divisor = 125, count += 1, count = 31

divisor = 625, which is >125, stop.

Total count = 31, correct.

n = 5:

divisor = 5, count +=1, count=1

divisor=25 >5, stop.

Total count=1, correct.

n=0:

divisor=5, 0//5=0, count=0

stop.

Total count=0, correct.

n=1:

divisor=5, 1//5=0, count=0

stop.

Total count=0, correct.

Looks good.

Now, considering the constraints, n can be up to 10^4, which is 10,000.

This method is efficient because it doesn't depend on n directly; it depends on the number of times n can be divided by 5, which is logarithmic in n.

In fact, the number of iterations is log_n base 5, which for n=10,000 is around 5 (since 5^5 = 3125, and 5^6 = 15625 >10,000).

So, it's O(log n) time complexity, which is efficient.

The follow-up question suggests thinking about a solution with logarithmic time complexity, which this seems to satisfy.

I don't think there's a way to make it faster than O(log n), as we need to consider the powers of 5 up to n.

Alternatively, one might think about using the formula for the number of trailing zeros directly, but this iterative approach is straightforward and easy to understand.

I should also consider edge cases:

- n = 0: should return 0

- n = 1: should return 0

- n = 4: floor(4/5)=0, so 0 zeros (4! = 24, correct)

- n = 5: 1 zero, as shown earlier

- n = 6: 1 zero, correct

- n = 25: 6 zeros, correct

- n = 100: floor(100/5)=20, floor(100/25)=4, floor(100/125)=0, total 24 zeros

100! = 9.33262154439441e+157, which has 24 trailing zeros. Correct.

I think this covers most of the cases.

Now, in Python, integer division is done using '//' operator, which gives the floor division result.

So, implementing this should be straightforward.

Let me write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To determine the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a given integer \( n \), we need to calculate the number of times 10 is a factor in \( n! \). Since \( 10 = 2 \times 5 \), and there are generally more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \( n \).

### Approach
1. **Count Factors of 5**: The number of trailing zeroes is equal to the number of times \( n! \) can be divided by 10, which is determined by the number of pairs of factors 2 and 5. Since there are more 2s than 5s, the number of 5s dictates the number of trailing zeroes.
2. **Iterate and Count**: We repeatedly divide \( n \) by 5 and count the number of times this division is possible until \( n \) becomes less than 5.

John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","I'd be happy to help you with that! So, you need to implement a class called `BSTIterator` which is an iterator over the in-order traversal of a Binary Search Tree (BST). The main methods are `next()` and `hasNext()`, and you need to ensure that they run efficiently.

First, let's understand what an in-order traversal of a BST is. In-order traversal means visiting the left subtree, then the root, and then the right subtree. For a BST, this traversal gives nodes in ascending order.

So, the idea is to have an iterator that can give you the next smallest element in the BST each time you call `next()`, and `hasNext()` should tell you if there are more elements left.

One straightforward way is to perform the entire in-order traversal at the beginning and store the results in a list. Then, `next()` and `hasNext()` can be implemented easily using this list. However, this approach uses O(n) space where n is the number of nodes in the tree, which might not be efficient if the tree is large.

The follow-up question asks for an implementation where `next()` and `hasNext()` run in average O(1) time and use O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree. This suggests that we should use a strategy that doesn't require storing all elements upfront but instead keeps track of the current position in the in-order traversal.

A good approach to achieve this is to use a stack to simulate the in-order traversal. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization:** Start with the root node and push all its left children onto the stack. This brings us to the smallest element in the BST.

2. **next():** Pop the top node from the stack, which is the current smallest node. Then, push all the left children of its right subtree onto the stack to prepare for the next elements.

3. **hasNext():** Just check if the stack is empty. If it's not empty, there are more elements; otherwise, there are no more elements.

This way, each `next()` operation takes O(1) average time because each node is pushed and popped exactly once, and the space used is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, because the stack will hold at most h nodes.

Let's outline the steps in code:

- **Constructor:**

- Initialize an empty stack.

- Start from the root and push all left children onto the stack.

- **next():**

- Pop the top node from the stack. This is the next smallest element.

- Let's call this node `temp`.

- Now, push all left children of `temp`'s right subtree onto the stack.

- Return `temp`'s value.

- **hasNext():**

- Return true if the stack is not empty, else false.

This approach ensures that we're only storing O(h) nodes at any time, and each node is processed exactly once.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. The dungeon is a 2D grid with m rows and n columns. Each cell can have a value that is either negative (demons that drain health), zero (empty rooms), or positive (magic orbs that increase health). The knight starts at the top-left cell and must reach the bottom-right cell, moving only right or down.

The goal is to find the smallest initial health value that allows the knight to reach the princess without his health dropping to zero or below at any point during his journey.

Let me consider the constraints:

- m and n are both between 1 and 200, so the grid can be up to 200x200 in size.

- Each cell's value can range from -1000 to 1000.

Given the size of the grid, an efficient algorithm is necessary, probably O(m*n) time complexity.

I need to think about how to compute the minimum health required at each step.

One way to approach this is to use dynamic programming, where I calculate the minimum health required at each cell, based on the minimum health required for the cells immediately to the right and below it.

Let me think about the base case. At the bottom-right cell, the knight needs enough health to survive entering that cell. If the cell has a positive value, the knight's health increases by that amount. If it's negative, the knight loses health. So, the minimum health required to enter the bottom-right cell is max(1, 1 - cell_value). This is because if the cell value is positive, the knight's health increases, so the minimum health needed could be as low as 1, but if the cell value is negative, the knight needs enough health to cover that loss and still have at least 1 health left.

For example, if the bottom-right cell is -5, the knight needs at least 6 health when entering that cell because he will lose 5 health, leaving him with 1.

If the bottom-right cell is 3, the knight's health increases by 3, so he only needs at least 1 health to enter.

Now, for the general case, for any cell (i, j), the knight can move right to (i, j+1) or down to (i+1, j). He wants to choose the path that requires the minimum initial health.

So, the minimum health required at cell (i, j) is the maximum of 1 and the minimum health required to enter the cell minus the cell's value.

Wait, that might not be precise. Let's think differently.

Let's define dp[i][j] as the minimum health required to reach the princess from cell (i, j).

Then, dp[m-1][n-1] = max(1, 1 - dungeon[m-1][n-1])

For other cells, dp[i][j] = max(1, min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1]) - dungeon[i][j])

This way, we're ensuring that when the knight arrives at cell (i, j), he has enough health to cover the loss (or gain) from that cell and still have enough to proceed to the next step with at least the required health.

We can compute this dp array starting from the bottom-right corner and moving upwards and leftwards.

Let me try this with the example provided:

dungeon = [

[-2, -3, 3],

[-5, -10, 1],

[10, 30, -5]

]

First, initialize dp[m][n] where m=3, n=3.

Initialize dp[2][2] = max(1, 1 - (-5)) = max(1, 6) = 6

Now, for dp[2][1]: min(dp[2][2]) - dungeon[2][1] = min(6) - 30 = 6 - 30 = -24, so max(1, -24) = 1

dp[2][0]: min(dp[2][1]) - dungeon[2][0] = min(1) - 10 = 1 - 10 = -9, so max(1, -9) = 1

dp[1][2]: min(dp[2][2]) - dungeon[1][2] = 6 - 1 = 5

dp[1][1]: min(dp[1][2], dp[2][1]) - (-10) = min(5, 1) - (-10) = 1 + 10 = 11

dp[1][0]: min(dp[1][1], dp[2][0]) - (-5) = min(11, 1) - (-5) = 1 + 5 = 6

dp[0][2]: min(dp[1][2]) - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2

dp[0][1]: min(dp[0][2], dp[1][1]) - (-3) = min(2, 11) - (-3) = 2 + 3 = 5

dp[0][0]: min(dp[0][1], dp[1][0]) - (-2) = min(5, 6) - (-2) = 5 + 2 = 7

So, dp[0][0] = 7, which matches the example's expected output.

Great, this seems to work.

Now, to implement this in code, I can iterate from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner, filling in the dp array accordingly.

I need to handle the boundaries carefully:

- For cells in the last row, they can only move right.

- For cells in the last column, they can only move down.

- For other cells, they can choose to move right or down, and we take the minimum required health from those two options.

Let me sketch a plan:

1. Initialize a 2D dp array of size m x n.

2. Set dp[m-1][n-1] = max(1, 1 - dungeon[m-1][n-1])

3. For each cell from (m-1, n-1) to (0, 0), filling in dp[i][j] as follows:

a. If it's the last row, only consider moving right: dp[i][j] = max(1, dp[i][j+1] - dungeon[i][j])

b. If it's the last column, only consider moving down: dp[i][j] = max(1, dp[i+1][j] - dungeon[i][j])

c. For other cells, dp[i][j] = max(1, min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1]) - dungeon[i][j])

4. The answer is dp[0][0]

This seems efficient, as it's O(m*n) time and space.

I should also consider if I can optimize the space. Since I'm only looking at the next row and next column, maybe I can use a 1D array, but it might be more complicated.

For now, I'll stick with the 2D dp array.

Let me consider another example to verify:

dungeon = [[0]]

Then dp[0][0] = max(1, 1 - 0) = 1, which matches the second example.

Another test case: dungeon = [[-3, 5], [10, -20]]

Let's compute dp:

dp[1][1] = max(1, 1 - (-20)) = max(1, 21) = 21

dp[1][0] = max(1, dp[1][1] - 10) = max(1, 21 - 10) = max(1, 11) = 11

dp[0][1] = max(1, dp[1][1] - 5) = max(1, 21 - 5) = max(1, 16) = 16

dp[0][0] = max(1, min(dp[0][1], dp[1][0]) - (-3)) = max(1, min(16, 11) - (-3)) = max(1, 11 + 3) = max(1, 14) = 14

So, the minimum initial health should be 14.

Let's simulate the path:

Path right: -3 -> 5 -> 10 -> -20

Health: 14 -3 =11, +5 =16, +10=26, -20=6 (survives)

Alternative path: down -> right:

10 -> -20 -> -3 -> 5

Health: 14 +10=24, -20=4, -3=1, +5=6 (survives)

Another possible path: right, down, right:

-3 -> 5 -> -20

Health: 14 -3=11, +5=16, -20=-4 (dies)

Wait, that's not possible because the knight chooses the path that requires the minimum initial health, assuming he chooses the optimal path.

In this case, the minimum initial health of 14 ensures he can take the path that keeps his health above zero.

Wait, but in the path right, down, right: 14 -3=11, +5=16, -20=-4, which is invalid.

So, the knight would choose the path right, right, down or down, right, right, both of which keep health above zero.

I need to make sure that the dp approach indeed finds the path that requires the minimum initial health.

In this case, it seems to work.

Another consideration: if all cells are zero, the minimum health should be 1.

If there are positive cells, the knight can potentially have extra health, but the minimum initial health is still determined by the lowest health required along the path.

If there are only negative cells, the knight needs enough initial health to cover the cumulative negative values without dropping to zero.

I think the dp approach handles all these cases.

Now, to implement this in Python.

I need to be careful with the indices, ensuring that I don't go out of bounds.

I'll use a nested loop: outer loop for rows from m-1 to 0, inner loop for columns from n-1 to 0.

Implement the dp array as a list of lists.

Finally, return dp[0][0]

Let me write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum initial health required for a knight to navigate from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a dungeon grid, where each cell can affect the knight's health points (positive or negative), and the knight can only move right or down.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The knight must reach the princess located at the bottom-right corner with minimum initial health while ensuring his health points never drop to zero or below.
   - Each cell in the dungeon can either decrease or increase the knight's health points.

2. **Insight**:
   - We need to calculate the minimum health required at each cell, considering the health required in subsequent steps.
   - Starting from the bottom-right corner and moving upwards and leftwards, we can use dynamic programming to compute the required health for each cell based on the minimum health required for the adjacent cells to the right and below.

3. **Dynamic Programming Solution**:
   - Initialize a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum health required to reach the princess from cell `(i, j)`.
   - Set `dp[m-1][n-1] = max(1, 1 - dungeon[m-1][n-1])` to ensure the knight has at least 1 health point when reaching the princess.
   - Fill the DP table in reverse order, computing the required health for each cell based on the minimum of the required health from the right or down cell, adjusted by the health change in the current dungeon cell.
   - The minimum initial health required is found in `dp[0][0]`.

The challenge lies in determining the optimal order for these numbers, which isn't simply achieved by sorting them in descending order.

### Approach

1. **Custom Comparison Function:** The key to solving this problem is to define a custom comparison function that decides which of two numbers should come first in the final arrangement. For any two numbers `x` and `y`, we need to compare the strings `str(x) + str(y)` and `str(y) + str(x)`. If `str(x) + str(y)` is greater than `str(y) + str(x)`, then `x` should come before `y`; otherwise, `y` should come before `x`.

2. **Sorting the Array:** Use this custom comparison function to sort the array of numbers. In Python, this can be achieved by using the `sorted` function with a custom key that compares pairs of numbers as described.

3. **Edge Case Handling:** If the array consists only of zeros, the result should be `""0""`. This can be checked by verifying if the first element in the sorted array is zero and, if so, returning `""0""` immediately.

    return dp[k][n - 1]
```
    
    The algorithm uses dynamic programming to build a table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit after completing `i` transactions up to day `j`. Initialize `dp` with all zeros, since no initial transactions will result in 0 profit.

First, handle the case where `k > n / 2`. If allowed transactions (`k`) are more than half of the available days (`n`), you can simply trade daily by only considering positive profits.

Now, use two nested loops to fill the `dp` table. The outer loop iterates over the allowed transactions (1 to k), and the inner loop iterates over the days (1 to n-1). Inside the inner loop, find the maximum difference between the current day's price and previous days' prices minus the maximum profit after completing one less transaction at previous days (i.e., `prices[j] + dp[i-1][j'] - prices[j']` for all j' < j). This will keep track of the most profitable second transaction after buying a stock at the highest possible profit for the first transaction.

Finally, return the value in the bottom-right corner of the `dp` table (i.e., `dp[k][n-1]`), which provides the maximum profit after completing the allowed number of transactions.
    ","You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions: i.e. you may buy at most `k` times and sell at most `k` times.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 2, prices = \[2,4,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** k = 2, prices = \[3,2,6,5,0,3\]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= k <= 100`
*   `1 <= prices.length <= 1000`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000` John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","I've got this problem here about finding the maximum profit from stock transactions, with a limit on the number of transactions you can make. So, I need to maximize profit by buying and selling stocks, but I can only do this up to k times. And, I have to remember that I can't have multiple transactions going at the same time; I need to sell a stock before I buy again.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's being asked. The prices are given in an array, where each element represents the price of the stock on that day. I need to buy on one day and sell on another day after that, and I can do this up to k times. The goal is to maximize the total profit from these transactions.

Let me think about a simple example to grasp this better. Take the first example:

k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]

So, days 1,2,3 with prices 2,4,1. I can make at most 2 transactions.

Looking at the prices, if I buy on day 1 (price 2) and sell on day 2 (price 4), I get a profit of 2. Then, if I try to buy on day 3 (price 1), there's no higher price after that to sell, so that wouldn't make sense. So, the total profit is 2, which matches the example.

Another example:

k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]

Here, prices are 3,2,6,5,0,3.

One possible way is to buy on day 2 (price 2), sell on day 3 (price 6), profit is 4.

Then, buy on day 5 (price 0), sell on day 6 (price 3), profit is 3.

Total profit is 7, which is the output in the example.

Alright, so I need a way to find the best times to buy and sell up to k times to maximize profit.

I recall that for unlimited transactions, there's a straightforward greedy approach where you just accumulate all possible profits from increasing subsequences. But here, I have a limit on the number of transactions, which makes it more complex.

I think this calls for a dynamic programming solution, where I keep track of the state based on the day and the number of transactions done so far.

Let me think about the state variables I need.

1. The day I'm currently considering (i, ranging from 0 to n-1, where n is the length of prices).

2. The number of transactions I've completed so far (j, ranging from 0 to k).

3. Whether I currently hold a stock or not.

Wait, but in this problem, since you can't have multiple transactions overlapping, maybe I don't need to track holding a stock separately.

Let me think differently.

I can define dp[i][j] as the maximum profit up to day i with at most j transactions.

But I think I need to consider whether the last transaction is completed or not.

Alternatively, I've seen similar problems where dp[i][j] represents the maximum profit up to day i with j transactions, and whether you hold a stock or not.

But perhaps that's complicating it.

Let me look for a different approach.

I found that if k is larger, say k >= n/2, then it's essentially unlimited transactions, and I can use the greedy approach.

But in this problem, k can be up to 100, and n up to 1000, so k can be less than n/2.

Wait, but in the constraints, it says 1 <= k <= 100, and 1 <= prices.length <= 1000.

So, I need a general solution that works for any k up to 100.

I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider the recursive approach first, and then try to optimize it with memoization or iterative DP.

So, recursive approach:

At each day, I have options:

1. Do nothing.

2. Buy stock (if I haven't reached the maximum transactions and I don't own a stock).

3. Sell stock (if I own a stock).

Wait, but I need to keep track of whether I own a stock or not.

So, maybe I need to track the number of completed transactions and whether I own a stock.

This seems like I need three dimensions in my DP:

dp[i][j][0] = max profit up to day i with j transactions completed, not holding a stock.

dp[i][j][1] = max profit up to day i with j transactions completed, holding a stock.

Wait, but each transaction consists of a buy and a sell, so maybe I need to define a transaction as a pair of buy and sell.

In this case, j represents the number of pairs.

But in the problem, it says ""you may complete at most k transactions: i.e. you may buy at most k times and sell at most k times.""

So, each transaction consists of a buy and a sell, and I can have up to k such pairs.

So, j represents the number of pairs (buy and sell).

But in this setup, I need to ensure that I don't have overlapping transactions.

Given that, perhaps dp[i][j][0] and dp[i][j][1] is a valid approach.

Let me try to define it properly.

dp[i][j][0] = maximum profit up to day i, with exactly j transactions completed, not holding a stock.

dp[i][j][1] = maximum profit up to day i, with exactly j transactions completed, holding a stock.

Wait, but transactions are defined as buy and sell pairs.

So, if I have j transactions completed, that means I've done j buys and j sells.

But in the problem, it says ""you may complete at most k transactions: i.e. you may buy at most k times and sell at most k times.""

So, I can have up to k buys and up to k sells, but each sell must follow a buy.

I think it's better to consider that each transaction consists of a buy and a sell, and I need to complete j such pairs.

Given that, dp[i][j][0] and dp[i][j][1] seems appropriate.

Let me try to set up the base cases and transitions.

Base cases:

- dp[0][0][0] = 0 (no transactions, no stocks held)

- dp[0][0][1] = -prices[0] (buy on day 1)

- dp[0][j][0] = -infinity for j > 0 (can't have completed transactions without any days)

- dp[0][j][1] = -infinity for j > 0

Wait, maybe I need to adjust this.

Actually, since I can't complete any transactions on day 0, dp[0][0][0] = 0, and dp[0][j][0] and dp[0][j][1] for j > 0 should be -infinity because it's impossible.

Similarly, dp[0][0][1] = -prices[0], because on day 1, I can buy the stock.

Now, for the transitions:

For dp[i][j][0], which is maximum profit up to day i with exactly j transactions completed and not holding a stock.

This can be achieved in two ways:

1. On day i, do nothing, keeping that you don't hold a stock: dp[i-1][j][0]

2. On day i, sell a stock, which means before that you held a stock and completed j-1 transactions: dp[i-1][j-1][1] + prices[i]

So, dp[i][j][0] = max(dp[i-1][j][0], dp[i-1][j-1][1] + prices[i])

For dp[i][j][1], which is maximum profit up to day i with exactly j transactions completed and holding a stock.

This can be achieved in two ways:

1. On day i, do nothing, keeping that you hold a stock: dp[i-1][j][1]

2. On day i, buy a stock, which means before that you didn't hold a stock and have completed j transactions: dp[i-1][j][0] - prices[i]

Wait, but buying a stock should increment the number of transactions only when you sell it.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the definition of j.

Wait, if j represents the number of transactions completed (i.e., buy and sell pairs), then buying a stock doesn't increment j until you sell it.

So, in dp[i][j][1], you're holding a stock, meaning you've done j transactions plus one more buy.

So, perhaps j represents the number of sells completed.

In that case, buying a stock would mean you're in a new transaction, so j remains the same.

Wait, maybe it's better to define j as the number of sells completed.

So, dp[i][j][0] = max profit up to day i with j sells completed, not holding a stock.

dp[i][j][1] = max profit up to day i with j sells completed, holding a stock.

Then, to buy a stock, you need to have j buys and j sells completed previously, and then do a new buy.

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

I found that in some solutions, they define dp[i][j] where i is the day and j is the number of transactions (buy and sell pairs), and track whether you hold a stock or not.

But perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that each transaction consists of a buy and a sell, and I need to maximize the profit with up to k such pairs.

I need to select 2*k days: k buys and k sells, in alternating order, to maximize the profit.

This seems similar to selecting a sequence of buys and sells.

But that might not be efficient for large n and k.

I need a more efficient approach.

I recall that for k >= n/2, it's equivalent to unlimited transactions, and I can use the greedy approach.

In this case, since k can be up to 100 and n up to 1000, it's possible that k >= n/2.

So, I can handle that as a special case.

But for general k, I need a DP approach.

Let me try to define dp[i][j] where i is the day and j is the number of transactions completed (sells completed).

Then, dp[i][j] can be:

- Not holding a stock: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j] + prices[i] - buy_price)

But I need to track the buy_price, which complicates things.

Alternatively, I can define dp[j][0] as the maximum profit after j transactions, not holding a stock.

dp[j][1] as the maximum profit after j transactions, holding a stock.

Wait, but I need to track over days as well.

I need to find a way to optimize this.

Let me look for a standard approach for this problem.

I found that a standard approach is to define dp[i][j][k], where:

- i is the day

- j is the number of transactions

- k is whether holding a stock or not

But this would be O(n * k * 2) which is O(1000 * 100 * 2) = 200,000 operations, which is acceptable.

I need to implement this efficiently.

Let me try to define the DP states more clearly.

dp[i][j][0] = maximum profit up to day i, with exactly j sells completed, not holding a stock.

dp[i][j][1] = maximum profit up to day i, with exactly j sells completed, holding a stock.

Then, the transitions would be:

dp[i][j][0] = max(dp[i-1][j][0], dp[i-1][j][1] + prices[i])

dp[i][j][1] = max(dp[i-1][j][1], dp[i-1][j-1][0] - prices[i])

Explanation:

- dp[i][j][0]: either do nothing (keep not holding a stock), or sell a stock today.

- dp[i][j][1]: either do nothing (keep holding a stock), or buy a stock today. To buy a stock today, you need to have j-1 sells completed previously, and not hold a stock.

Base cases:

- dp[0][0][0] = 0 (start with no stocks, no transactions)

- dp[0][0][1] = -prices[0] (buy on day 1)

- dp[0][j][0] = -infinity for j > 0 (can't have sells without any days)

- dp[0][j][1] = -infinity for j > 0

Also, for i >=0, j ==0:

- dp[i][0][0] = 0

- dp[i][0][1] = -prices[i] (buying on day i)

I need to make sure these base cases are handled correctly.

Then, the answer would be the maximum over dp[n-1][j][0] for j from 0 to k, because we can't hold a stock at the end.

Wait, but dp[n-1][j][0] represents not holding a stock after j sells, which is fine.

So, the final answer is max over j from 0 to k of dp[n-1][j][0]

Now, I need to implement this DP approach efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 1000 and k up to 100, a 3D DP array of size 1000 x 100 x 2 is acceptable.

I can use a 3D list in Python to implement this.

But to optimize space, I can use two 2D arrays: previous and current, to keep track of the previous day's states.

But for simplicity, I'll use a 3D array first and optimize later if needed.

Let me try to write some pseudocode.

Initialize dp[i][j][0] and dp[i][j][1] for all i, j.

Set dp[0][0][0] = 0

Set dp[0][0][1] = -prices[0]

For j > 0:

dp[0][j][0] = -infinity

dp[0][j][1] = -infinity

Then, for each day i from 1 to n-1:

for each j from 0 to k:

dp[i][j][0] = max(dp[i-1][j][0], dp[i-1][j][1] + prices[i])

if j >=1:

dp[i][j][1] = max(dp[i-1][j][1], dp[i-1][j-1][0] - prices[i])

else:

dp[i][j][1] = max(dp[i-1][j][1], -prices[i])

# for j=0, buying on day i would be dp[i-1][0][0] - prices[i] = 0 - prices[i]

Finally, the answer is max over j from 0 to k of dp[n-1][j][0]

Let me test this logic with the first example:

k=2, prices=[2,4,1]

n=3

Initialize dp[3][3][2]

dp[0][0][0] = 0

dp[0][0][1] = -2

dp[0][1][0] = -infinity

dp[0][1][1] = -infinity

dp[0][2][0] = -infinity

dp[0][2][1] = -infinity

Day 1 (i=1, price=4):

for j=0:

dp[1][0][0] = max(dp[0][0][0], dp[0][0][1] + 4) = max(0, -2 +4)= max(0,2)=2

dp[1][0][1] = max(dp[0][0][1], dp[0][-1][0]-4)= max(-2, -infinity)= -2

for j=1:

dp[1][1][0] = max(dp[0][1][0], dp[0][1][1]+4)= max(-infinity, -infinity +4)= -infinity

dp[1][1][1] = max(dp[0][1][1], dp[0][0][0]-4)= max(-infinity, 0-4)= -4

for j=2:

dp[1][2][0] = max(dp[0][2][0], dp[0][2][1]+4)= max(-infinity, -infinity +4)= -infinity

dp[1][2][1] = max(dp[0][2][1], dp[0][1][0]-4)= max(-infinity, -infinity -4)= -infinity

Day 2 (i=2, price=1):

for j=0:

dp[2][0][0] = max(dp[1][0][0], dp[1][0][1] +1)= max(2, -2 +1)= max(2,-1)=2

dp[2][0][1] = max(dp[1][0][1], dp[1][-1][0]-1)= max(-2, -infinity -1)= -2

for j=1:

dp[2][1][0] = max(dp[1][1][0], dp[1][1][1] +1)= max(-infinity, -4 +1)= max(-infinity,-3)= -infinity

dp[2][1][1] = max(dp[1][1][1], dp[1][0][0]-1)= max(-4, 2-1)= max(-4,1)=1

for j=2:

dp[2][2][0] = max(dp[1][2][0], dp[1][2][1]+1)= max(-infinity, -infinity +1)= -infinity

dp[2][2][1] = max(dp[1][2][1], dp[1][1][0]-1)= max(-infinity, -infinity -1)= -infinity

Finally, answer is max(dp[2][0][0], dp[2][1][0], dp[2][2][0]) = max(2, -infinity, -infinity)=2

Which matches the first example.

Another example:

k=2, prices=[3,2,6,5,0,3]

n=6

Initialize dp[6][3][2]

dp[0][0][0]=0

dp[0][0][1]=-3

dp[0][1][0]=-infinity

dp[0][1][1]=-infinity

dp[0][2][0]=-infinity

dp[0][2][1]=-infinity

Day 1 (i=1, price=2):

dp[1][0][0]= max(dp[0][0][0], dp[0][0][1]+2)= max(0, -3+2)= max(0,-1)=0

dp[1][0][1]= max(dp[0][0][1], dp[-1][0][0]-2)= max(-3, -infinity)= -3

dp[1][1][0]= max(dp[0][1][0], dp[0][1][1]+2)= max(-infinity, -infinity +2)= -infinity

dp[1][1][1]= max(dp[0][1][1], dp[0][0][0]-2)= max(-infinity, 0-2)= -2

dp[1][2][0]= max(dp[0][2][0], dp[0][2][1]+2)= max(-infinity, -infinity +2)= -infinity

dp[1][2][1]= max(dp[0][2][1], dp[0][1][0]-2)= max(-infinity, -infinity -2)= -infinity

Day 2 (i=2, price=6):

dp[2][0][0]= max(dp[1][0][0], dp[1][0][1]+6)= max(0, -3 +6)= max(0,3)=3

dp[2][0][1]= max(dp[1][0][1], dp[1][-1][0]-6)= max(-3, -infinity)= -3

dp[2][1][0]= max(dp[1][1][0], dp[1][1][1]+6)= max(-infinity, -2 +6)= max(-infinity,4)=4

dp[2][1][1]= max(dp[1][1][1], dp[1][0][0]-6)= max(-2, 0-6)= max(-2,-6)= -2

dp[2][2][0]= max(dp[1][2][0], dp[1][2][1]+6)= max(-infinity, -infinity +6)= -infinity

dp[2][2][1]= max(dp[1][2][1], dp[1][1][0]-6)= max(-infinity, -infinity -6)= -infinity

Day 3 (i=3, price=5):

dp[3][0][0]= max(dp[2][0][0], dp[2][0][1]+5)= max(3, -3 +5)= max(3,2)=3

dp[3][0][1]= max(dp[2][0][1], dp[2][-1][0]-5)= max(-3, -infinity)= -3

dp[3][1][0]= max(dp[2][1][0], dp[2][1][1]+5)= max(4, -2 +5)= max(4,3)=4

dp[3][1][1]= max(dp[2][1][1], dp[2][0][0]-5)= max(-2, 3-5)= max(-2,-2)= -2

dp[3][2][0]= max(dp[2][2][0], dp[2][2][1]+5)= max(-infinity, -infinity +5)= -infinity

dp[3][2][1]= max(dp[2][2][1], dp[2][1][0]-5)= max(-infinity, 4-5)= max(-infinity,-1)= -1

Day 4 (i=4, price=0):

dp[4][0][0]= max(dp[3][0][0], dp[3][0][1]+0)= max(3, -3 +0)= max(3,-3)=3

dp[4][0][1]= max(dp[3][0][1], dp[3][-1][0]-0)= max(-3, -infinity)= -3

dp[4][1][0]= max(dp[3][1][0], dp[3][1][1]+0)= max(4, -2 +0)= max(4,-2)=4

dp[4][1][1]= max(dp[3][1][1], dp[3][0][0]-0)= max(-2, 3-0)= max(-2,3)=3

dp[4][2][0]= max(dp[3][2][0], dp[3][2][1]+0)= max(-infinity, -1 +0)= max(-infinity,-1)= -1

dp[4][2][1]= max(dp[3][2][1], dp[3][1][0]-0)= max(-1, 4-0)= max(-1,4)=4

Day 5 (i=5, price=3):

dp[5][0][0]= max(dp[4][0][0], dp[4][0][1]+3)= max(3, -3 +3)= max(3,0)=3

dp[5][0][1]= max(dp[4][0][1], dp[4][-1][0]-3)= max(-3, -infinity)= -3

dp[5][1][0]= max(dp[4][1][0], dp[4][1][1]+3)= max(4, 3 +3)= max(4,6)=6

dp[5][1][1]= max(dp[4][1][1], dp[4][0][0]-3)= max(3, 3-3)= max(3,0)=3

dp[5][2][0]= max(dp[4][2][0], dp[4][2][1]+3)= max(-1, 4 +3)= max(-1,7)=7

dp[5][2][1]= max(dp[4][2][1], dp[4][1][0]-3)= max(4, 4-3)= max(4,1)=4

Finally, answer is max(dp[5][0][0], dp[5][1][0], dp[5][2][0])= max(3,6,7)=7

Which matches the second example.

Great, so this DP approach seems correct.

Now, I need to implement this in Python.

But before that, I should consider optimizing the space.

Since each day only depends on the previous day, I can use two 2D arrays: prev and curr, where prev[j][0] and prev[j][1] represent dp[i-1][j][0] and dp[i-1][j][1], and curr[j][0] and curr[j][1] represent dp[i][j][0] and dp[i][j][1].

This way, I can reduce the space from O(n*k*2) to O(k*2).

Given that k can be up to 100, this is acceptable.

Let me try to implement this.

Initialize prev[j][0] and prev[j][1] for j from 0 to k.

Set prev[0][0] = 0

prev[0][1] = -prices[0]

for j > 0:

prev[j][0] = -float('inf')

prev[j][1] = -float('inf')

Then, for each day i from 1 to n-1:

Create curr as a copy of prev.

for j from 0 to k:

curr[j][0] = max(prev[j][0], prev[j][1] + prices[i])

if j >=1:

curr[j][1] = max(prev[j][1], prev[j-1][0] - prices[i])

else:

curr[j][1] = max(prev[j][1], -prices[i])

Set prev = curr

Finally, the answer is max over j from 0 to k of prev[j][0]

This should work and save space.

I need to handle the base case for day 0 separately.

Also, I need to make sure that I handle j=0 correctly, as buying on day i would be prev[0][0] - prices[i] = 0 - prices[i]

Wait, in the code above, for j=0, prev[j-1][0] would be prev[-1][0], which is invalid.

So, I need to handle j=0 separately.

In the code above, for j >=1, curr[j][1] = max(prev[j][1], prev[j-1][0] - prices[i])

For j=0, curr[0][1] = max(prev[0][1], -prices[i])

Which is consistent with the earlier definition.

So, this should be fine.

I need to implement this carefully in code.

Also, I need to consider the case when k=0, but according to constraints, k >=1.

Wait, no, k >=1, as per constraints: 1 <= k <= 100.

So, k=0 is not possible.

Also, need to handle the case when n=1, but according to constraints, n >=1.

Wait, n can be 1, but with k >=1, but in that case, no transaction can be made, so profit is 0.

Wait, but if n=1, and k>=1, and prices=[p], then no transaction can be made, so profit is 0.

Need to make sure the code handles n=1 correctly.

Let me think about n=1.

prices=[p], k=1.

On day 1, you can buy but can't sell, so maximum profit is 0.

Yes, correct.

Another consideration: if k is very large, say k >= n//2, then it's equivalent to unlimited transactions, and I can use the greedy approach to accumulate all possible profits from increasing subsequences.

This might be more efficient.

Given that n can be up to 1000 and k up to 100, and 100 can be less than n//2 when n >=200.

But for n=1000, k=100, 100 < 500, so it's not unlimited.

But perhaps I can check if k >= n//2, and if so, use the greedy approach.

But given that k can be up to 100, and n up to 1000, it's probably not worth optimizing for this case, unless n is close to 2k.

But to make the code efficient, I'll proceed with the DP approach as outlined.

Now, let's proceed to implement this in Python.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from stock transactions given that we can complete at most `k` transactions. We cannot engage in multiple transactions simultaneously, meaning we must sell a stock before buying again.

### Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Definition:**
   - We use a 3D DP approach where `dp[i][j][0]` represents the maximum profit up to day `i` with exactly `j` transactions completed and not holding a stock.
   - `dp[i][j][1]` represents the maximum profit up to day `i` with exactly `j` transactions completed and holding a stock.

2. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[0][0][0] = 0` (start with no stocks, no transactions)
   - `dp[0][0][1] = -prices[0]` (buy on day 1)
   - For `j > 0`, `dp[0][j][0]` and `dp[0][j][1]` are set to negative infinity as it's impossible to complete transactions without any days.

3. **State Transition:**
   - For each day `i` from 1 to `n-1`:

       - Update `dp[i][j][0]` (not holding a stock):

Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","To solve this problem, we need to rotate an array to the right by `k` steps. The rotation should be done in-place, meaning we should modify the array directly without using extra space for another array.

### Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `nums` and a non-negative integer `k`.
   - We need to rotate the array to the right by `k` steps.
   - The rotation should be in-place, meaning we should not use extra space for another array.

2. **Constraints:**
   - The array length can be up to 10^5, so the solution should be efficient.
   - The elements of the array can be as large as 2^31 - 1, but this doesn't affect the rotation logic.

3. **Examples:**
   - For `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]` and `k = 3`, the output should be `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`.
   - For `nums = [-1,-100,3,99]` and `k = 2`, the output should be `[3,99,-1,-100]`.

4. **Approach:**
   - One straightforward way is to perform the rotation step by step, but this would be inefficient for large `k`.
   - A better approach is to reverse parts of the array to achieve the rotation efficiently.

5. **Algorithm:**
   - First, handle the case where `k` is larger than the array length by taking `k modulo len(nums)`.
   - Reverse the entire array.
   - Reverse the first `k` elements.
   - Reverse the remaining `len(nums) - k` elements.

6. **Complexity:**
   - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array, since reversing is O(n).
   - Space Complexity: O(1), as we are modifying the array in-place.

Let's break down the problem and think about how to approach it in Python.

First, I need to read the content of the file. Since it's a text file with rows and columns separated by spaces, I can read it line by line and split each line into a list of strings based on spaces.

So, I'll open the file, read its lines, and store them in a list. Then, for each line, I'll split it into words using space as the delimiter and store these lists in a 2D list (a list of lists).

Once I have this 2D list, transposing it means converting the rows into columns. In Python, I can use the `zip` function with the `*` operator to unpack the list of lists and then zip them together. This will effectively transpose the rows and columns.

After transposing, I need to format the output back into strings, with each row's words separated by spaces, and each row ended with a newline.

2. For `nums = [2,7,9,3,1]`, the optimal solution is to rob house 1, house 3, and house 5, which gives a total of 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

From these examples, it seems that skipping houses in a strategic way leads to the maximum sum without triggering the alarms.

I need to think about how to generalize this. One approach is to consider at each house whether to rob it or not, based on the maximum money collected so far from previous houses.

I recall that in dynamic programming, we often build up a solution by solving smaller subproblems and using their solutions to solve larger ones.

Let me consider defining a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from the first `i` houses.

The base cases would be:

- `dp[0] = 0` (no houses, no money)

- `dp[1] = nums[0]` (only one house, rob it)

For `i >= 2`, the recurrence relation would be:

`dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i-1])`

Explanation:

- `dp[i-1]`: skip the current house and take the maximum money from the first `i-1` houses.

- `dp[i-2] + nums[i-1]`: rob the current house and add its money to the maximum money from the first `i-2` houses.

The maximum of these two options will be the maximum money that can be robbed from the first `i` houses.

Let me test this logic with the first example:

`nums = [1,2,3,1]`

- `dp[0] = 0`

- `dp[1] = 1`

- `dp[2] = max(dp[1], dp[0] + 2) = max(1, 0 + 2) = 2`

- `dp[3] = max(dp[2], dp[1] + 3) = max(2, 1 + 3) = 4`

- `dp[4] = max(dp[3], dp[2] + 1) = max(4, 2 + 1) = 4`

The final answer is `dp[4] = 4`, which matches the expected output.

Now, the second example:

`nums = [2,7,9,3,1]`

- `dp[0] = 0`

- `dp[1] = 2`

- `dp[2] = max(dp[1], dp[0] + 7) = max(2, 0 + 7) = 7`

- `dp[3] = max(dp[2], dp[1] + 9) = max(7, 2 + 9) = 11`

- `dp[4] = max(dp[3], dp[2] + 3) = max(11, 7 + 3) = 11`

- `dp[5] = max(dp[4], dp[3] + 1) = max(11, 11 + 1) = 12`

Which matches the expected output of 12.

This seems correct. Now, I need to implement this in Python.

I should also consider edge cases:

- If there are no houses, return 0.

- If there is only one house, return its value.

- If all houses have zero money, return 0.

- If houses have negative values, since the problem constraints specify that `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`, I don't need to handle negative values.

Let me write the code accordingly.

Also, to optimize space, since we only need the last two DP values to compute the current one, I can use two variables to keep track of them instead of an entire array.

Let's define:

- `prev = 0` (dp[i-2])

- `curr = 0` (dp[i-1])

For each house, compute the new `curr` as `max(curr, prev + nums[i-1])`, and then update `prev` to the old `curr`.

Let me try this with the first example:

`nums = [1,2,3,1]`

- Initialize: prev = 0, curr = 0

- i=1: curr = max(0, 0 + 1) = 1; prev = 0

- i=2: curr = max(1, 0 + 2) = 2; prev = 1

- i=3: curr = max(2, 1 + 3) = 4; prev = 2

- i=4: curr = max(4, 2 + 1) = 4; prev = 4

Final answer: 4

Seems correct.

Another consideration: The problem constraints mention that the array length can be up to 100, and each house has between 0 and 400 dollars, so the algorithm should be efficient enough, as it's O(n) time and O(1) space.

Now, I'll proceed to implement this logic in Python.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the amount of money robbed from houses along a street, given that no two adjacent houses can be robbed. We use dynamic programming to efficiently solve this problem.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We maintain two variables, `prev` and `curr`, to track the maximum money that can be robbed up to the previous house (`prev`) and up to the current house (`curr`).
   
2. **Iteration**:
   - For each house, we decide whether to rob it or not:
     - If we rob the current house, we add its money to the maximum money from two houses ago (`prev`).
     - If we don't rob the current house, we keep the maximum money from the previous house (`curr`).
   - We then update `prev` and `curr` for the next iteration.

3. **Result**:
   - The final value of `curr` will be the maximum money that can be robbed from all houses.

This approach ensures that we never rob two adjacent houses and maximizes the looted money.

    The function uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the binary tree level by level. We use a queue to keep track of nodes at the current level. 

The algorithm starts by adding the root node to the queue. Then, while the queue is not empty, we iteratively process each level. During each iteration, we calculate the size of the current level, then loop through each node of that level. If we reach the last node of the current level, i.e. `(i == level_size - 1)`, we add that node's value to the result list. After processing the current node, we add its left and right children to the queue if they exist. 

After traversing the entire tree, we return the result list. The algorithm is the same for all languages, with the only differences being syntactical.

John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","So I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to determine if two strings are isomorphic. That means that each character in the first string can be replaced to get the second string, and the mapping has to be consistent throughout both strings. No two characters can map to the same character unless they are the same character.

First, I need to understand what it means for two strings to be isomorphic. Let's look at the examples provided:

1. s = ""egg"", t = ""add"" → true

Here, 'e' maps to 'a', and 'g' maps to 'd'. Each character in s is consistently replaced by a character in t.

2. s = ""foo"", t = ""bar"" → false

'f' maps to 'b', 'o' maps to 'a', but then another 'o' maps to 'r', which is inconsistent. So, since 'o' maps to both 'a' and 'r', which are different characters, this is not isomorphic.

3. s = ""paper"", t = ""title"" → true

'p' maps to 't', 'a' maps to 'i', 'p' again maps to 't' (consistent), 'e' maps to 'l', 'r' maps to 'e'. All mappings are consistent.

From these examples, I can see that for two strings to be isomorphic, there must be a one-to-one mapping from each character in s to a character in t, and this mapping must be consistent throughout both strings.

Now, to solve this problem, I need to find a way to check if such a mapping exists.

One approach is to use two dictionaries (hash maps) to keep track of the mappings from s to t and from t to s. This is because the mapping must be bijective; that is, each character in s maps to exactly one character in t, and vice versa.

Let me think about how to implement this.

I can iterate through both strings simultaneously, checking each pair of characters from s and t at the same position.

For each pair (s_char, t_char):

- If s_char is already in the s_to_t mapping:

- Check if it maps to t_char. If not, return False.

- If s_char is not in the s_to_t mapping:

- Check if t_char is already mapped to another character in t_to_s. If it is, return False.

- Otherwise, add the mapping s_char → t_char to s_to_t and t_char → s_char to t_to_s.

If I can go through the entire strings without finding any inconsistencies, then the strings are isomorphic.

Let me try to write some pseudocode for this:","def isIsomorphic(s, t):

s_to_t = {}

t_to_s = {}

### Approach

1. **Trie Node Structure:**

   - Each node will also have a flag to indicate whether a word ends at that node.

2. **Insert Operation:**
   - Start from the root node and iterate through each character in the word.
   - For each character, if it doesn't exist in the current node's children, create a new node.
   - Move to the child node corresponding to the character.
   - After processing all characters, mark the last node as the end of a word.

3. **Search Operation:**
   - Start from the root node and iterate through each character in the word.
   - For each character, check if it exists in the current node's children.
   - If at any point the character doesn't exist, return False.
   - After processing all characters, check if the last node is marked as the end of a word.

4. **StartsWith Operation:**
   - Similar to the search operation, but instead of checking if the last node is the end of a word, we just need to check if all characters in the prefix exist in the Trie.

John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","I'd be happy to help you with that problem. So, the task is to find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray within the given array `nums`, such that the sum of the elements in that subarray is greater than or equal to a given `target` value. If no such subarray exists, we should return 0.

First, let's understand what a subarray is. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array. For example, in the array [1, 2, 3, 4], some subarrays include [1], [1, 2], [2, 3, 4], etc., but not [1, 3] because it's not contiguous.

The problem asks for the smallest length of such a subarray where the sum of its elements is at least the target value.

Looking at the examples:

1. For target = 7 and nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3], the subarray [4,3] sums to 7 and has a length of 2, which is the smallest such subarray.

2. For target = 4 and nums = [1,4,4], the subarray [4] sums to 4 and has a length of 1.

3. For target = 11 and nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], no subarray sums up to 11, so the output is 0.

Constraints:

- 1 <= target <= 10^9

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5

- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

Given these constraints, we need an efficient solution, preferably O(n) time complexity, since n can be up to 100,000.

One efficient way to solve this is by using the sliding window technique. The idea is to maintain a window that represents the subarray we're currently considering. We'll have two pointers, let's say left and right, that define the current window.

We start with both pointers at the beginning of the array. We'll move the right pointer to the right, adding elements to the current sum, until the sum is greater than or equal to the target. Once we reach this condition, we can record the length of the current window and try to shrink the window from the left to see if we can find a smaller subarray that still meets the condition.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize variables:

- left = 0 (left pointer)

- current_sum = 0 (sum of the current window)

- min_length = infinity (or a large number, to keep track of the minimum window length found)

2. Iterate the right pointer from 0 to n-1:

a. Add nums[right] to current_sum.

b. While current_sum >= target:

i. Update min_length if the current window is smaller.

ii. Subtract nums[left] from current_sum.

iii. Move the left pointer to the right.

3. After iterating through the array, if min_length is still infinity, it means no such subarray was found, so return 0. Otherwise, return the min_length.

This approach ensures that we only traverse the array once, making it O(n) time complexity, which is efficient given the constraints.

Let's consider the first example to see this in action:

target = 7

nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]

- Initialize: left=0, current_sum=0, min_length=infinity

- right=0: current_sum=2 <7

- right=1: current_sum=2+3=5 <7

- right=2: current_sum=5+1=6 <7

- right=3: current_sum=6+2=8 >=7

- Update min_length: right-left+1 = 3-0+1=4

- Subtract nums[left]=2 from current_sum: current_sum=6

- Move left to 1

- current_sum=6 <7

- right=4: current_sum=6+4=10 >=7

- Update min_length: 4 vs. 4-1+1=4 (no change)

- Subtract nums[left]=3 from current_sum: current_sum=7

- Move left to 2

- current_sum=7 >=7

- Update min_length: 4 vs. 4-2+1=3

- Subtract nums[left]=1 from current_sum: current_sum=6

- Move left to 3

- current_sum=6 <7

- right=5: current_sum=6+3=9 >=7

- Update min_length: 3 vs. 5-3+1=3 (no change)

- Subtract nums[left]=2 from current_sum: current_sum=7

- Move left to 4

- current_sum=7 >=7

- Update min_length: 3 vs. 5-4+1=2

- Subtract nums[left]=4 from current_sum: current_sum=3

- Move left to 5

- current_sum=3 <7

- End of array

- The minimal length found is 2, which is correct.

This method efficiently finds the minimal subarray length by adjusting the window size dynamically.

Now, regarding the follow-up question about an O(n log n) solution, it's interesting to think about alternative approaches. One possible way is to use binary search in combination with prefix sums.

First, compute the prefix sums of the array, where prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements. Then, for each starting index i, use binary search to find the smallest ending index j such that prefix[j] - prefix[i] >= target.

This approach would have a time complexity of O(n log n) because for each of the n starting indices, we perform a binary search that takes O(log n) time.

However, the sliding window approach is more efficient with O(n) time complexity, so it's preferable given the constraints. But understanding both approaches can be beneficial for different scenarios or when constraints change.

In summary, the sliding window technique is an efficient and straightforward way to solve this problem, meeting the requirements and constraints provided.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray in `nums` such that the sum of the elements in the subarray is greater than or equal to a given `target`. If no such subarray exists, we should return 0.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window of the subarray.
   - Maintain a variable `current_sum` to keep track of the sum of the elements in the current window.
   - Use `min_length` to track the smallest length of a qualifying subarray found.

2. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - Start with both pointers at the beginning of the array.
   - Move the `right` pointer to the right, adding elements to `current_sum`, until `current_sum` is greater than or equal to the `target`.
   - Once `current_sum` meets or exceeds the `target`, record the window length and check if it's smaller than the current `min_length`.
   - Move the `left` pointer to the right, subtracting elements from `current_sum`, to see if a smaller subarray can be found that still meets the condition.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - This approach ensures that each element is visited at most twice (once by the right pointer and once by the left pointer), resulting in O(n) time complexity.

So, the task is to find an order in which I can take all the courses, given some prerequisites. Each prerequisite is a pair [a, b], meaning I have to take course b before course a.

First, I need to understand what this problem is asking for. It seems like a classic problem in graph theory called ""topological sorting."" In topological sorting, we arrange the vertices of a directed graph in a linear order such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

So, in this case, the courses are vertices, and the prerequisites are directed edges from the prerequisite course to the course that requires it. For example, if [1, 0] is a prerequisite, it means there's an edge from 0 to 1, indicating that 0 must be taken before 1.

My goal is to perform a topological sort on this graph. If the graph has a cycle, which would mean there's a circular dependency in prerequisites, then it's impossible to complete all courses, and I should return an empty array.

To solve this, I can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Since DFS is often easier to implement for topological sorting, I'll consider that approach first.

Here's a high-level plan:

1. **Build the Graph:**
   - Create a graph where each node represents a course.
   - For each prerequisite [a, b], draw a directed edge from b to a, indicating that b is a prerequisite for a.

2. **Compute In-Degrees:**
   - Calculate the in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each node. The in-degree represents the number of prerequisites each course has.

3. **Topological Sort Using BFS (Kahn's Algorithm):**
   - Start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree of zero).
   - Add these courses to the result list and remove them from the graph.
   - Decrease the in-degree of the courses that depended on the removed courses.
   - Repeat the process until no courses are left or a cycle is detected.

Alternatively, I could use DFS to perform the topological sort:

1. **DFS Approach:**
   - Perform DFS on the graph.
   - During the DFS, keep track of the visit status of each node to detect cycles.
   - Use a stack to keep track of the order in which courses should be taken.
   - If a cycle is detected, return an empty array.

I need to decide which approach to use. Kahn's algorithm (BFS) is straightforward and efficient for this purpose. It's also easier to implement without recursion depth issues that can occur with DFS in large graphs.

Given that the number of courses can be up to 2000, and the number of prerequisites can be up to numCourses * (numCourses - 1), which is 2000 * 1999 = 3,998,000, I need an efficient algorithm. Both DFS and BFS are O(V + E), which should be acceptable for these constraints.

I'll proceed with Kahn's algorithm for this solution.

**Steps for Kahn's Algorithm:**

1. **Build the Graph:**
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Each index in the list corresponds to a course, and the list at that index contains the courses that depend on it.

2. **Compute In-Degrees:**
   - Create an array to store the in-degree of each course.
   - For each prerequisite [a, b], increment the in-degree of a.

3. **Initialize a Queue:**
   - Add all courses with an in-degree of zero to the queue.

4. **Perform Topological Sort:**
   - While the queue is not empty:
     - Dequeue a course and add it to the result list.
     - Decrease the in-degree of all courses that depend on it.
     - If any of these courses now have an in-degree of zero, add them to the queue.
   - If the result list contains all courses, return the order; otherwise, return an empty array.

I need to ensure that I handle all edge cases, such as:

- No prerequisites: All courses can be taken in any order.
- Only one course: Return that course.
- Courses with multiple prerequisites.
- Prerequisites forming a chain.
- Prerequisites forming a tree.
- Prerequisites containing a cycle.

To detect cycles, I'll check if the number of courses in the result list equals the total number of courses. If not, it means there's a cycle, and I should return an empty array.

Now, I'll proceed to implement this algorithm in Python.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find an order in which we can take all the courses, given some prerequisites. This is a classic problem in graph theory known as topological sorting.

### Approach
1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph where a edge from course `b` to course `a` indicates that `b` is a prerequisite for `a`.
   
2. **Topological Sorting using Kahn's Algorithm:**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each course.
   - **Step 2:** Identify courses with no prerequisites (in-degree of zero) and add them to a queue.
   - **Step 3:** While the queue is not empty:
     - Dequeue a course and add it to the result list.
     - Decrease the in-degree of all courses that depend on the dequeued course.
     - If any of these courses now have an in-degree of zero, add them to the queue.
   - **Step 4:** If the result list contains all courses, return the order; otherwise, return an empty array, indicating it's impossible to finish all courses due to a cycle.

                return False
            return self._search_helper(child_node, word, index + 1)
```

    
    We use a Trie data structure to store the words. Each Trie node has an array of child pointers for all lowercase English letters (size 26) and a boolean flag `is_word` indicating if the word ends at this node. Initially, all child pointers are set to null, and `is_word` is set to false.

When we add a word, we walk through the Trie, creating new child nodes if necessary, and set `is_word` to true for the last Trie node representing the word's last character.

When we search for a word, we use a helper function that takes the current Trie node, the word, and the current position in the word. If the current character in the word is a dot (`.`), we search for any matching character by iterating through all its children, recursively calling the helper function with the next position in the word. If the current character in the word is a lowercase letter, we proceed to the corresponding child node and continue the search.

At any point, if we reach the word's end, we check if the `is_word` of the current Trie node is true. If it is, we found a match. Otherwise, the search continues.
    ","Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding if a string matches any previously added string.

Implement the `WordDictionary` class:

*   `WordDictionary()` Initializes the object.
*   `void addWord(word)` Adds `word` to the data structure, it can be matched later.
*   `bool search(word)` Returns `true` if there is any string in the data structure that matches `word` or `false` otherwise. `word` may contain dots `'.'` where dots can be matched with any letter.

**Example:**

**Input**
\[ ""WordDictionary "", ""addWord "", ""addWord "", ""addWord "", ""search "", ""search "", ""search "", ""search ""\]
\[\[\],\[ ""bad ""\],\[ ""dad ""\],\[ ""mad ""\],\[ ""pad ""\],\[ ""bad ""\],\[ "".ad ""\],\[ ""b.. ""\]\]
**Output**
\[null,null,null,null,false,true,true,true\]

**Explanation**
WordDictionary wordDictionary = new WordDictionary();
wordDictionary.addWord( ""bad "");
wordDictionary.addWord( ""dad "");
wordDictionary.addWord( ""mad "");
wordDictionary.search( ""pad ""); // return False
wordDictionary.search( ""bad ""); // return True
wordDictionary.search( "".ad ""); // return True
wordDictionary.search( ""b.. ""); // return True

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= word.length <= 25`
*   `word` in `addWord` consists of lowercase English letters.
*   `word` in `search` consist of `'.'` or lowercase English letters.
*   There will be at most `2` dots in `word` for `search` queries.
*   At most `104` calls will be made to `addWord` and `search`. Additionally, the sky was clear that day.","Alright, I need to design a data structure that can store words and allow searching for words, including words with dots as wildcards. Sounds like a classic problem, probably best solved with a trie (prefix tree).

First, I need to understand what a trie is. A trie is a tree-like data structure where each node represents a character. Paths from the root to any node form a word. For example, if I add ""bad"", ""dad"", and ""mad"", the trie would have a root, and from there, branches for 'b', 'd', and'm', each leading to 'a', and then to 'd'.

But in this case, the search can include dots, which can match any letter. So, for example, "".ad"" should match ""bad"", ""dad"", and ""mad"", and ""b.."" should match ""bad"".

I need to implement the WordDictionary class with three methods: init, addWord, and search.

Starting with the initialization, I'll probably need to define the structure of the trie node. Each node should have children, which are a map from characters to other nodes, and a flag to indicate if a word ends at that node.

For addWord, I'll traverse the trie, creating new nodes as needed for each character in the word, and set the end-of-word flag at the last node.

The search method is trickier because of the dots. If there's no dot, it's similar to traversing the trie for exact matches. But if there is a dot, I need to try all possible paths at that point.

I think I'll need to implement a recursive function for the search method. This function will take the current node and the remaining part of the word to search for.

If the current character is a dot, I'll need to recursively search all children of the current node with the remainder of the word.

If it's a specific character, I'll check if that character is a child of the current node and recursively search from that child with the remainder of the word.

The base case is when the word is empty, in which case I should check if the current node is an end of a word.

I should also handle the case where the word has multiple dots, but the constraints say there will be at most two dots in the search queries.

I need to make sure that the implementation is efficient enough, considering that there can be up to 10^4 calls to addWord and search.

I should also consider edge cases, like adding the same word multiple times, searching for a word not in the dictionary, searching with dots, and so on.

Let me sketch a rough plan:

- Define a TrieNode class with a map of characters to TrieNode and a boolean flag for end-of-word.

- In WordDictionary, have a root TrieNode.

- addWord: traverse the trie, creating nodes for each character in the word, and set the end flag at the last node.

- search: implement a recursive function that takes a node and a word, and returns True if the word matches from that node onwards, considering dots as wildcards.

I should also think about how to implement the recursive search efficiently, maybe using depth-first search.

Let me try to write some pseudocode:

class TrieNode:

def __init__(self):

self.children = {}

self.end_of_word = False

class WordDictionary:

def __init__(self):

self.root = TrieNode()

def addWord(self, word: str) -> None:

node = self.root

for char in word:

if char not in node.children:

node.children[char] = TrieNode()

node = node.children[char]

node.end_of_word = True

def search(self, word: str) -> bool:

def dfs(node, word):

if not word:

return node.end_of_word

char = word[0]

if char == '.':

for child in node.children.values():

if dfs(child, word[1:]):

return True

return False

else:

if char in node.children:

return dfs(node.children[char], word[1:])

return False

return dfs(self.root, word)

This seems reasonable. Now, I need to consider if there are any optimizations I can make, especially since there might be up to 10^4 calls.

One thing is thattrie traversal is efficient for exact matches, but with dots, it can turn into a full DFS, which might be time-consuming if there are many possibilities.

Given that the constraints specify that there will be at most 2 dots in the search queries, it means that in the worst case, the recursive search will explore up to 26^2 = 676 paths (if the first two characters are dots), assuming only lowercase English letters.

Since each path traversal is O(M), where M is the length of the word, and M is at most 25, the total time per search could be up to around 17,000 operations, which should be acceptable for the problem's constraints.

I should also consider memory usage. With up to 10^4 adds, and each word up to 25 characters, the trie could have up to around 250,000 nodes in the worst case, but in practice, there will be sharing of prefixes.

I need to make sure that my implementation doesn't have any bugs, especially in the search function.

Let me think about some test cases:

- Add ""bad"", ""dad"", ""mad""

- Search ""pad"" -> should return False

- Search ""bad"" -> should return True

- Search "".ad"" -> should return True (matches ""bad"", ""dad"", ""mad"")

- Search ""b.."" -> should return True (matches ""bad"")

- Search ""..."" -> should return True (matches all three words)

- Search ""a.."" -> should return False (no 3-letter words starting with 'a')

- Search ""."" -> should return False (no 1-letter words)

- Add ""a"", then search ""."" -> should return True

- Add ""a"", then search ""a"" -> should return True

- Add ""a"", then search ""b"" -> should return False

- Add ""a"", then search "".."" -> should return False (only one-letter word)

I should also consider edge cases like single-letter words, words with only dots, etc.

I should also think about performance, but given the constraints, it should be fine.

I need to make sure that the recursive search doesn't cause a stack overflow. Python's recursion limit is usually 1000, but since the word length is up to 25, it should be okay.

Alternatively, I could implement the search using iteration with a stack or queue, but recursion seems clearer and sufficient for this problem.

I should also ensure that the trie is built correctly when adding words. For example, adding ""bad"" and ""bard"" should correctly share the prefix ""ba"" and differ at the last character.

Let me try to write some code based on the pseudocode I sketched earlier.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need a data structure that efficiently supports adding words and searching for words, including those with wildcards represented by dots ('.'). A Trie (prefix tree) is an appropriate data structure for this purpose. 

### Approach

1. **Trie Node Structure**: 
   - Each Trie node contains a dictionary to store its children nodes and a flag to indicate the end of a word.
   
2. **Adding Words**:
   - Traverse the Trie, creating new nodes for each character in the word if they don't already exist.
   - Set the end-of-word flag to `True` at the node representing the last character of the word.
   
3. **Searching for Words**:
   - Implement a recursive search function that handles wildcards ('.'):
     - If the current character is not a wildcard, proceed to the corresponding child node.
     - If the current character is a wildcard, recursively search all possible child nodes.
   - The base case of the recursion is when the entire word has been traversed, in which case check if the current node marks the end of a word.

This problem is a classic example of using a Trie data structure combined with backtracking. The idea is to build a Trie from the list of words and then traverse the board using DFS, checking if the path forms a word in the Trie.

First, let's understand the problem:

- We have a 2D board of characters.

- We have a list of words.

- We need to find which words from the list can be formed by traversing the board in adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically), without reusing the same cell more than once in a single word.

Constraints:

- The board can be up to 12x12.

- There can be up to 30,000 words, each up to 10 characters long.

Given these constraints, we need an efficient way to search for the words on the board.

Approach:

1. **Trie Data Structure**: 
   - We'll build a Trie from the list of words. This allows us to store the words in a way that makes it efficient to search for them on the board.
   - Each node in the Trie will represent a character, and the path from the root to a node forms a prefix of the words.

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - We'll iterate through each cell of the board.
   - For each cell, we'll start a DFS traversal to explore all possible paths from that cell.
   - During the DFS, we'll check if the path forms a valid prefix in the Trie. If not, we'll terminate that path.
   - If we find a complete word during the traversal, we'll add it to our result list.

3. **Backtracking**:
   - To ensure that we don't reuse the same cell more than once in a single word, we'll mark the cell as visited during the DFS and backtrack by unmarking it after exploring all possible paths from that cell.

The catch is that adjacent houses are connected, and robbing two adjacent houses will trigger the security system. Also, the first and last houses are neighbors because they're in a circle.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. In a linear arrangement of houses, I can use dynamic programming to decide whether to rob each house based on the maximum money I can get without robbing adjacent houses. But here, the houses are in a circle, which means the first and last houses are adjacent, so I can't rob both.

I recall that in the linear version of this problem, the solution involves keeping track of two possibilities at each house: robbing the current house or not robbing it, and choosing the option that maximizes the total money without robbing adjacent houses.

In the circular case, I need to handle the dependency between the first and last houses. One approach that comes to mind is to consider two separate cases:

1. **Rob the first house:** If I rob the first house, I cannot rob the last house because they are adjacent. So, I can consider the houses from the first to the second-to-last house as a linear problem.

2. **Do not rob the first house:** If I don't rob the first house, I can consider all houses from the second to the last house as a linear problem.

Then, I can compute the maximum money for both cases and take the maximum of these two amounts.

Let me try to formalize this:

- **Case 1:** Rob the first house. Then, I cannot rob the last house. So, I solve the linear problem for houses 1 to n-1.

- **Case 2:** Do not rob the first house. Then, I can solve the linear problem for houses 2 to n.

Finally, the answer would be the maximum of the results from Case 1 and Case 2.

I need to make sure that in Case 1, I include the money from the first house, and in Case 2, I don't include the first house.

Wait a minute, in Case 1, if I rob the first house, I cannot rob the second house, so the problem reduces to robbing houses 1 and from house 3 to house n-1, since house n is adjacent to house 1.

Actually, no. If I rob house 1, I cannot rob house 2 or house n. So, I can only rob houses from 3 to n-1, depending on their arrangements.

But this seems complicated. Maybe sticking to the initial approach of considering two separate linear problems is better.

Let me consider an example to verify this approach.

**Example 1:**

nums = [2,3,2]

- Case 1: Rob house 1 (2), cannot rob house 3 (2), so total = 2

- Case 2: Do not rob house 1, rob house 2 (3), total = 3

- Maximum is 3

This matches the given output.

**Example 2:**

nums = [1,2,3,1]

- Case 1: Rob house 1 (1), cannot rob house 4 (1), solve linear problem for houses 1 to 3:

- Houses: 1 (1), 2 (2), 3 (3)

- Maximum without robbing adjacent: 1 + 3 = 4

- But since we rob house 1, we cannot rob house 4, which is already considered.

- Case 2: Do not rob house 1, solve linear problem for houses 2 to 4:

- Houses: 2 (2), 3 (3), 4 (1)

- Maximum without robbing adjacent: 2 + 1 = 3

- Maximum of Case 1 and Case 2: max(4, 3) = 4

This also matches the given output.

**Example 3:**

nums = [1,2,3]

- Case 1: Rob house 1 (1), cannot rob house 3 (3), so total = 1

- Case 2: Do not rob house 1, rob house 2 (2), total = 2

- Maximum is 2

Wait, but the given output is 3. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, in this case, if I rob house 3 (3), I cannot rob house 1 (1), but house 2 is not adjacent to house 3 if I don't rob house 1. Wait, no: houses are in a circle, so house 1 and house 3 are adjacent.

Wait, with three houses in a circle, robbing any two adjacent houses will alert the police.

So, in this case, the maximum I can rob is either house 1 (1), house 2 (2), or house 3 (3), but not combinations like house 1 and house 3 because they are adjacent.

So, the maximum should be 3, which is house 3.

But according to my earlier approach:

- Case 1: Rob house 1 (1), cannot rob house 3 (3), so total = 1

- Case 2: Do not rob house 1, rob house 2 (2), total = 2

- Maximum is 2

But the correct answer is 3.

This suggests that my approach is missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how I handle the cases.

In the case where the number of houses is small, like 3, this approach might not work as expected.

Maybe I need to consider that in Case 1, when I rob house 1, I cannot rob house 2 or house n.

But in the three-house example, robbing house 1 prevents robbing house 3, and robbing house 2 prevents robbing house 1 and house 3.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach is incomplete.

Let me think differently.

Another approach could be to consider that in a circular arrangement, I can transform the problem into two linear problems:

1. Rob houses from 0 to n-2

2. Rob houses from 1 to n-1

Then, take the maximum of these two.

In the three-house example:

- Houses: 0 (1), 1 (2), 2 (3)

- Case 1: Rob houses 0 to n-2: houses 0 and 1 (but cannot rob both adjacent, so max is 2)

- Case 2: Rob houses 1 to n-1: houses 1 and 2 (cannot rob both, so max is 3)

- Maximum is 3

This seems correct.

So, perhaps my initial approach was correct, and I just miscalculated in the third example.

Let me re-examine the third example with this approach.

**Example 3:**

nums = [1,2,3]

- Case 1: Rob houses 0 to n-2: houses 0 (1) and 1 (2)

- Maximum without robbing adjacent: max(1, 2) = 2

- Case 2: Rob houses 1 to n-1: houses 1 (2) and 2 (3)

- Maximum without robbing adjacent: max(2, 3) = 3

- Maximum of Case 1 and Case 2: max(2, 3) = 3

Yes, this matches the given output.

So, my initial approach was correct, and I just made a mistake in considering the subproblems.

Therefore, the plan is:

- If there is only one house, return its value.

- Otherwise, compute the maximum amount by considering two scenarios:

- Robbing from the first house to the second-to-last house.

- Robbing from the second house to the last house.

- Return the maximum of these two scenarios.

Now, I need to implement this in code.

I need a function to solve the linear version of the problem, which computes the maximum amount that can be robbed from a list of houses arranged in a line.

I can use dynamic programming for this. I can keep track of two variables:

- prev: maximum amount without robbing the previous house

- curr: maximum amount considering the current house

At each house, I can calculate the new maximum amounts:

- new_prev = curr

- new_curr = max(curr, prev + current_house_value)

Then, update prev and curr with new_prev and new_curr.

After iterating through all houses, curr will hold the maximum amount.

I need to implement this function and use it for both scenarios in the circular problem.

Let me write some pseudocode first.","def rob_linear(nums):

    prev = 0

    curr = 0

    for num in nums:

        new_prev = curr

        new_curr = max(curr, prev + num)

        prev = new_prev

        curr = new_curr

    return curr

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. To make `s` a palindrome by adding characters only in front of it, we need to identify the longest prefix of `s` that is already a palindrome. Then, the remaining suffix that is not part of this palindrome can be reversed and added to the front of `s` to make the entire string a palindrome.

For example, consider `s = ""aacecaaa""`:

1. Identify the longest prefix that is a palindrome. In this case, ""aacecaa"" is a palindrome.
2. The remaining suffix is ""a"", which is already a palindrome, so no need to add anything.
3. But according to the problem, we need to add characters only in front, so we need to consider the minimal addition.

Wait, in this case, ""aacecaaa"" itself is not a palindrome, but ""aaacecaaa"" is a palindrome.

Wait, let's check:

- ""aacecaaa"" -> Not a palindrome because ""aacecaaa"" reversed is ""aaaaceca"".

- ""aaacecaaa"" -> ""aaacecaaa"" reversed is ""aaacecaaa"".

So, by adding ""aa"" in front, we make it a palindrome.

But according to the example, the output is ""aaacecaaa"", which seems correct.

Another example: `s = ""abcd""`

- The longest palindromic prefix is just ""a"".

- So, the remaining suffix is ""bcd"".

- Reverse ""bcd"" to ""dcb"" and add it in front: ""dcbabcd"".

Yes, that matches the example.

So, the general approach is:

1. Find the longest palindromic prefix in `s`.

2. The remaining suffix is `s` minus this prefix.

3. Reverse the remaining suffix and add it to the front of `s`.

But finding the longest palindromic prefix directly might be inefficient for large strings (up to 5*10^4 characters).

We need an efficient way to find the longest palindromic prefix.

One efficient way is to use the concept of string matching, specifically the KMP algorithm, which can compute the prefix table in linear time.

Wait, KMP is used for pattern matching, but perhaps we can adapt it here.

Another idea is to concatenate `s` with its reverse and use string matching to find the largest overlap.

Wait, let's think differently.

Let's consider the string `s + reverse(s)`, and find the largest prefix that is a palindrome.

But that might not be straightforward.

An alternative approach is to consider the entire string and find the largest suffix that is a palindrome.

Wait, no, we need the largest prefix that is a palindrome.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Let me think about the properties of palindromes.

If I have a string `s`, and I want to make it a palindrome by adding characters only in front, I need to add characters that mirror the end of the string to the beginning.

So, the idea is to find the smallest number of characters to add in front so that the entire string becomes a palindrome.

This is equivalent to finding the longest palindromic prefix.

But as mentioned, for large strings, we need an efficient way to compute this.

I recall that there is a way to find the longest palindromic substring in linear time using Manacher's algorithm, but that's for any palindromic substring, not necessarily a prefix.

Wait, perhaps we can modify Manacher's algorithm to focus on prefixes.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use string hashing to find the longest palindromic prefix.

String hashing can be used to compute hashes of substrings efficiently.

For example, we can compute the hash of the prefix and the hash of the corresponding suffix and check if they are equal.

Wait, but this might not be straightforward due to the need to handle hashes of reversed strings.

Another idea is to use Z-algorithm or KMP to find the largest prefix that is also a suffix in the concatenated string of `s` and its reverse.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the largest k such that the first k characters of `s` form a palindrome.

To check if a prefix is a palindrome, I can compare it with its reverse.

But again, for large strings, this needs to be done efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can reverse `s` and find the largest prefix of `s` that matches the suffix of the reversed `s`.

Wait, that might be confusing.

Let me try with an example.

Take `s = ""aacecaaa""`

Reverse `s` is ""aaaecaea""

Now, I need to find the largest k such that `s[0:k]` == reverse of `s[-k:]`

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think.

If I have `s = ""aacecaaa""`, and I want to find the largest k where `s[0:k]` is equal to the reverse of `s[len(s)-k:]`.

Wait, that would mean `s[0:k]` == `s[len(s)-k:][::-1]`.

Yes, that would ensure that the prefix is equal to the reverse of the suffix, which is a way to ensure palindromicity.

Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating it.

I found a useful approach online: to find the shortest palindrome by adding characters in front, you can find the largest suffix of `s` that is a palindrome, and then add the reverse of the prefix that comes before this suffix.

Wait, no, I think it's the other way around.

Actually, to make `s` a palindrome by adding characters in front, you can find the largest palindrome prefix, and then add the reverse of the remaining suffix in front.

Wait, but I need to do it efficiently.

I found that one efficient way is to consider the string `s + '#' + reverse(s)`, and then compute the prefix function (KMP table) for this new string.

The value of the prefix function at the end of this new string will give the length of the longest prefix of `s` that is also a suffix of the reverse of `s`, which effectively gives us the length of the longest palindromic prefix.

Then, the remaining part of `s` that is not part of this palindromic prefix can be reversed and added to the front.

This seems efficient, as KMP can be computed in linear time.

Let me try to formalize this:

1. Let `s` be the input string.

2. Let `rev_s` be the reverse of `s`.

3. Consider the string `s + '#' + rev_s`, where '#' is a character not present in `s`.

4. Compute the prefix function (KMP table) for this new string.

5. The value of the prefix function at the end of this new string will give the length of the longest proper prefix of `s` that is also a suffix of `rev_s`.

6. Therefore, the length of the longest palindromic prefix is this value.

7. The remaining suffix of `s` that is not part of this palindromic prefix is `s[length - k: ]`, where `k` is the length of the palindromic prefix.

8. Reverse this remaining suffix and add it to the front of `s` to get the shortest palindrome.

Wait, but in the KMP table, the value at the end gives the length of the longest proper prefix that is also a suffix.

But in our case, we need to find the longest palindromic prefix, which might not be a proper prefix.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust this approach.

Alternatively, I can use the Z-algorithm, which computes the longest substring starting from each position that matches the prefix of the string.

By concatenating `s` with the reverse of `s`, I can use the Z-algorithm to find the longest palindromic prefix.

Wait, perhaps that's a better approach.

Let me look into the Z-algorithm.

The Z-algorithm constructs an array `z` where `z[i]` is the length of the longest substring starting from `s[i]` that matches the prefix of `s`.

To find the longest palindromic prefix, I can:

1. Compute the Z-array for `s + rev_s`.

2. Find the largest `z[i]` where `i` is in the second half (corresponding to `rev_s`), and `z[i]` extends to the start of the string.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.

I found a straightforward approach using Manacher's algorithm to find the longest palindromic prefix.

But Manacher's algorithm is typically used to find all palindromic substrings, which might be overkill.

Wait, perhaps there is a smarter way.

I found that we can solve this problem in linear time using the prefix function from the KMP algorithm.

Here's how:

- Consider the string `s + rev_s`.

- Compute the prefix function for this string.

- The value of the prefix function at the end of `s + rev_s` gives the length of the longest proper prefix that is also a suffix.

- Therefore, the length of the longest palindromic prefix is this value.

- The remaining part of `s` that is not part of this palindromic prefix is `s[length - k: ]`, where `k` is the length of the palindromic prefix.

- Reverse this remaining suffix and add it to the front of `s` to get the shortest palindrome.

Wait, but I need to make sure that I'm not including the entire `s` as the palindromic prefix, which would only happen if `s` is already a palindrome.

In that case, no need to add anything.

Otherwise, I need to add the reverse of the suffix that is not part of the palindromic prefix.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, I need to implement the KMP prefix function.

Here's a Python function to compute the prefix function:","python
def compute_prefix(s):

The constraints specify that the array can have up to 100,000 elements, and k can be any integer from 1 to the length of the array.

First, let's understand what the kth largest element means. If we sort the array in descending order, the kth element in this sorted array is what we're looking for. For example, in the array [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], the 3rd largest element is 4.

However, sorting the entire array in descending order would take O(n log n) time, which doesn't meet our requirement of O(n) time complexity. Therefore, we need a more efficient approach.

One efficient way to find the kth largest element is to use a min-heap of size k. The min-heap will keep track of the k largest elements seen so far. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialize a min-heap with the first k elements of the array.**
2. **For each remaining element in the array:**
   - If the element is larger than the smallest element in the heap (which is the root of the heap), replace the smallest element with the current element and heapify.
3. **After processing all elements, the root of the heap will be the kth largest element.**

This approach ensures that we only keep track of the top k elements at any time, and the heap operations (insert and extract-min) are O(log k), which is O(log n) in the worst case since k <= n. Since we perform these operations n times, the total time complexity is O(n log k), which is better than O(n log n) but not yet O(n).

To achieve O(n) time complexity, we can use the quickselect algorithm, which is an in-place variant of the quicksort algorithm. Quickselect allows us to find the kth smallest (or largest) element in linear time on average.

Here's how the quickselect algorithm works:

1. **Choose a pivot element from the array.**
2. **Partition the array such that elements less than the pivot are on the left, and elements greater than the pivot are on the right.**
3. **If the pivot's position is equal to k, return the pivot.**
4. **If the pivot's position is less than k, recursion continues on the right subarray.**
5. **If the pivot's position is greater than k, recursion continues on the left subarray.**

The key to quickselect's efficiency is choosing a good pivot. If the pivot is chosen randomly or using a median-of-medians approach, the average time complexity is O(n), and the worst case is O(n^2), but with random pivots, the worst case is unlikely.

Given that the problem requires O(n) time complexity, and considering that the average case of quickselect is O(n), we can proceed with this approach.

Let's outline the steps in code:

1. **Implement a function to partition the array around a pivot.**
2. **Implement the quickselect function that recursively partitions the array until the kth largest element is found.**

We also need to handle edge cases, such as when the array has duplicate elements, when k is 1 (finding the largest element), or when k is equal to the length of the array (finding the smallest element).

Let's consider the examples provided:

**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2

Sorted in descending order: [6,5,4,3,2,1]

The 2nd largest element is 5.

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4

Sorted in descending order: [6,5,5,4,3,2,2,1]

The 4th largest element is 4.

Now, let's think about the constraints:

- 1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5

- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

Given that n can be up to 100,000, we need an efficient solution that doesn't exceed time limits.

Potential errors to avoid:

- Choosing a bad pivot in quickselect that leads to O(n^2) time complexity.

- Incorrectly partitioning the array, leading to wrong positions of the pivot.

- Handling duplicates properly.

To mitigate these risks, we can use random pivot selection to avoid the worst-case scenario in quickselect.

Now, let's proceed to implement the solution using the quickselect algorithm.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the kth largest element in an array of integers with a time complexity of O(n). We will use the quickselect algorithm, which is an efficient selection algorithm to find the kth largest element in linear time on average.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Quickselect:**
   - Quickselect is based on the partitioning method used in quicksort.
   - We choose a pivot and partition the array such that elements less than the pivot are on the left, and elements greater than the pivot are on the right.
   - Depending on the pivot's position, we recursively partition the left or right subarray until we find the kth largest element.

2. **Partitioning:**
   - Select a pivot element randomly.
   - Reorder the array so that all elements less than the pivot are on the left, and all elements greater than the pivot are on the right.
   - Return the final position of the pivot.

3. **Quickselect Iteration:**
   - If the pivot's position is equal to k, return the pivot.
   - If the pivot's position is less than k, search in the right subarray.
   - If the pivot's position is greater than k, search in the left subarray.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle duplicates properly.
   - Manage cases where k is 1 (largest element) or equal to the length of the array (smallest element).

    The algorithm is based on a backtracking approach. We use a helper function which takes some parameters: `k` and `n` to limit the combinations, `current` which is the last considered element, `current_comb` which is the current combination being formed, and `result` which is the list of all valid combinations found so far.

We keep updating the current combination and decreasing `k` and `n` accordingly as we call the helper function recursively. When we have `k = 0` and `n = 0`, we know we have reached a valid combination and add it to our result list. To prevent revisiting the same combinations, we make sure that the numbers are considered in increasing order (thus, the current value being picked always starts at `current + 1`).

When backtracking, we remove the last considered element from the current combination so that we can try another combination. Following this approach ensures that we visit every potential combination only once and store it if it is valid.
    ","Find all valid combinations of `k` numbers that sum up to `n` such that the following conditions are true:

*   Only numbers `1` through `9` are used.
*   Each number is used **at most once**.

Return _a list of all possible valid combinations_. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 3, n = 7
**Output:** \[\[1,2,4\]\]
**Explanation:**
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
There are no other valid combinations.

**Explanation:**
1 + 2 + 6 = 9

2 + 3 + 4 = 9
There are no other valid combinations.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** k = 4, n = 1
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** There are no valid combinations.
Using 4 different numbers in the range \[1,9\], the smallest sum we can get is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and since 10 > 1, there are no valid combination.

    The algorithm starts by creating an empty set. Then it iterates through the input array. For each number in the array, it checks if the number is already in the set. If the number is in the set, it means there's a duplicate, so it returns true. If the number is not in the set, it adds the number to the set. If the function has not returned true after iterating through the entire array, it means that there are no duplicates, so it returns false.

In Python, we use the fact that sets don't allow duplicates, so we can directly compare the length of the original list with the length of the set created from the list. If they are not equal, it means there are duplicates in the list, and the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

### Approach

1. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - Check each pair of elements to see if there are any duplicates.
   - This would involve nested loops, resulting in O(n^2) time complexity, which is inefficient for large arrays.

2. **Sorting Approach**:
   - Sort the array first, which brings duplicates next to each other.
   - Then, iterate through the sorted array and check if any adjacent elements are equal.
   - Sorting takes O(n log n) time, and the scan takes O(n) time, making the overall time complexity O(n log n).

3. **Hash Set Approach**:
   - Use a set to track the elements we've seen so far.
   - Iterate through the array, and for each element, check if it's already in the set.
   - If it is, return `True` (duplicate found); otherwise, add it to the set.
   - This approach has a time complexity of O(n) because set operations (add and check) are O(1) on average.
   - However, it uses additional space proportional to the number of unique elements in the array.

Given the constraints (`1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`), efficiency is crucial, so the hash set approach is preferred for its O(n) time complexity.

So, the task is to compute the skyline of a city given the locations and heights of all its buildings. The skyline should be represented as a list of key points sorted by their x-coordinate, where each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline, except the last point which has a y-coordinate of 0.

First, I need to understand what a skyline is. From the description, it's the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings when viewed from a distance. So, essentially, it's the union of all the buildings' outlines, merged where they overlap in height.

Given that, I need to process a list of buildings, each defined by their left and right x-coordinates and their height. The buildings are grounded on a flat surface at height 0, and I have to consider the ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings as part of the skyline.

The output should be a list of key points, which are the points where the height changes in the skyline. These are typically the left edges of buildings or points where the height changes due to buildings ending or starting.

One important note is that there should be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output. So, if multiple buildings cause the skyline to have the same height over a range, I need to merge those segments into a single segment.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to consider all the points where the skyline might change. These points are the left and right edges of all buildings. So, I can create a list of all these x-coordinates, sorted in ascending order.

For each such x-coordinate, I need to determine the maximum height of buildings at that x-coordinate. This maximum height will define the skyline at that point.

However, simply taking the maximum height at each x-coordinate might not be efficient, especially since there are up to 10,000 buildings, and sorting 20,000 points (left and right edges) could be time-consuming.

I recall that in computational geometry, there's a standard approach to solving the skyline problem using a sweep line algorithm. The idea is to imagine a vertical line sweeping from left to right across the plane, and at each key x-coordinate, update the active set of buildings and determine the current maximum height.

So, here's a plan:

1. **Event Points**: Create a list of events where each event is either the start or end of a building. Each event has an x-coordinate and a height. For starts, the height is positive, and for ends, it's negative. This helps in adding or removing buildings from the active set.

2. **Sort Events**: Sort these events by x-coordinate. If two events have the same x-coordinate, handle start events before end events to ensure correct height ordering.

3. **Active Heights**: Use a data structure to keep track of the active heights of buildings that are currently intersected by the sweep line. A heap (priority queue) can be useful here because it allows efficient retrieval of the maximum height.

4. **Track Skyline**: As we process each event, we update the active heights and check if the maximum height changes. If it does, we add a key point to the skyline.

Now, let's think about the data structures:

- For the events, I can create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the x-coordinate, the height (positive for start, negative for end), and possibly a flag indicating start or end.

- For the active heights, a max heap will be useful because it allows me to quickly get the current maximum height.

In Python, the `heapq` module provides a min-heap, but I need a max-heap. One trick is to invert the heights and use the min-heap to simulate a max-heap.

Let me outline the steps in code:

1. **Create Events**: For each building [left, right, height], create two events: (left, height,'start') and (right, height, 'end').

2. **Sort Events**: Sort the events by x-coordinate. If x-coordinates are equal, sort start events before end events, and among start events, sort by height descending (taller buildings first).

3. **Initialize Data Structures**: Use a heap to store active heights, and a set to keep track of building ends.

4. **Process Events**:

- For each event:

- If it's a start event, add the height to the heap.

- If it's an end event, remove the height from the heap.

- After updating the heap, check if the current maximum height has changed.

- If it has changed, add the current x-coordinate and the new height to the skyline.

5. **Handle Duplicates**: Ensure that no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height are present in the output.

There are a few tricky parts here:

- Managing the heap to efficiently get the current maximum height.

- Handling the removal of heights from the heap correctly, especially since heap operations in Python are limited to popping the smallest element.

- Ensuring that the skyline points are correctly ordered and that no redundant points are included.

To handle the removal of heights from the heap, I need to be careful because Python's heap doesn't support efficient removal of arbitrary elements. One common approach is to use a ""lazy"" deletion, where I keep a set of heights to be removed, and when the top of the heap is in this set, I pop it and continue until the top is not marked for removal.

Wait, but in this problem, since we're dealing with building starts and ends, and the ends correspond to removing a height, I need to mark those heights for removal when their building ends.

Let me think differently. Since the events are processed in order, and ends are processed after their corresponding starts, I can keep track of the active buildings and determine the current maximum height at each step.

Here's a refined approach:

1. **Create Events**: For each building [left, right, height], create two events: (left, height,'start') and (right, height, 'end').

2. **Sort Events**: Sort the events by x-coordinate. If x-coordinates are equal, sort start events before end events, and among start events, sort by height descending.

3. **Initialize**: Use a heap to store the active heights. Initialize an empty skyline list.

4. **Process Events**:

- Initialize a variable to keep track of the previous maximum height.

- For each event:

- If it's a start event, add the height to the heap.

- If it's an end event, remove the height from the heap.

- Determine the current maximum height from the heap.

- If the current maximum height is different from the previous maximum height, add a new key point to the skyline with the current x-coordinate and the new height.

- Update the previous maximum height.

5. **Final Point**: After processing all events, add a final point with x-coordinate of the last event and y-coordinate 0 to mark the end of the skyline.

I need to handle the heap operations carefully. Since Python's `heapq` is a min-heap, I'll store negative heights to simulate a max-heap.

Also, when removing a height from the heap, I might need to handle the case where the height has already been removed due to multiple buildings ending at the same x-coordinate.

Let me consider an example to verify this logic.

**Example 1:**

Input: buildings = [[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]]

Expected Output: [[2,10],[3,15],[7,12],[12,0],[15,10],[20,8],[24,0]]

Let's create the events:

- (2, 10,'start')

- (9, 10, 'end')

- (3, 15,'start')

- (7, 15, 'end')

- (5, 12,'start')

- (12, 12, 'end')

- (15, 10,'start')

- (20, 10, 'end')

- (19, 8,'start')

- (24, 8, 'end')

Sort the events by x-coordinate, and among same x-coordinates, start before end, and higher heights first for starts.

Sorted events:

1. (2, 10,'start')

2. (3, 15,'start')

3. (5, 12,'start')

4. (7, 15, 'end')

5. (9, 10, 'end')

6. (12, 12, 'end')

7. (15, 10,'start')

8. (19, 8,'start')

9. (20, 10, 'end')

10. (24, 8, 'end')

Now, process each event:

- Initialize heap: empty, prev_height = 0, skyline = []

- Event (2, 10,'start'):

- Add -10 to heap

- Current max height = 10

- prev_height = 0!= 10, so add [2, 10]

- prev_height = 10

- Event (3, 15,'start'):

- Add -15 to heap

- Current max height = 15

- prev_height = 10!= 15, so add [3, 15]

- prev_height = 15

- Event (5, 12,'start'):

- Add -12 to heap

- Current max height = 15

- prev_height = 15 == 15, no change

- Event (7, 15, 'end'):

- Remove -15 from heap

- Current max height = 12

- prev_height = 15!= 12, so add [7, 12]

- prev_height = 12

- Event (9, 10, 'end'):

- Remove -10 from heap

- Current max height = 12

- prev_height = 12 == 12, no change

- Event (12, 12, 'end'):

- Remove -12 from heap

- Current max height = 0

- prev_height = 12!= 0, so add [12, 0]

- prev_height = 0

- Event (15, 10,'start'):

- Add -10 to heap

- Current max height = 10

- prev_height = 0!= 10, so add [15, 10]

- prev_height = 10

- Event (19, 8,'start'):

- Add -8 to heap

- Current max height = 10

- prev_height = 10 == 10, no change

- Event (20, 10, 'end'):

- Remove -10 from heap

- Current max height = 8

- prev_height = 10!= 8, so add [20, 8]

- prev_height = 8

- Event (24, 8, 'end'):

- Remove -8 from heap

- Current max height = 0

- prev_height = 8!= 0, so add [24, 0]

- prev_height = 0

Final skyline: [[2,10],[3,15],[7,12],[12,0],[15,10],[20,8],[24,0]]

Which matches the expected output.

Looks good. Now, I need to implement this logic in Python.

I need to handle the heap operations carefully, especially since I'm using a min-heap for max-heap functionality by inverting the signs.

Also, I need to ensure that when removing a height from the heap, if it's not at the top, I handle it properly. But in this approach, since I'm processing events in order and only removing heights that are at the top of the heap, this shouldn't be an issue.

Wait, no. If multiple buildings end at the same x-coordinate, I might need to remove multiple heights from the heap. To handle this, I can keep a count of each height's occurrences in the heap and only pop them when their count reaches zero.

But to simplify, in this approach, since I'm processing events in order and removing heights one by one, and only removing the top of the heap, this should work as long as I only remove each height once.

Let me think about another example.

**Example 2:**

Input: buildings = [[0,2,3],[2,5,3]]

Expected Output: [[0,3],[5,0]]

Events:

- (0, 3,'start')

- (2, 3, 'end')

- (2, 3,'start')

- (5, 3, 'end')

Sort events:

1. (0, 3,'start')

2. (2, 3, 'end')

3. (2, 3,'start')

4. (5, 3, 'end')

Process:

- Initialize heap: empty, prev_height = 0, skyline = []

- Event (0, 3,'start'):

- Add -3 to heap

- Current max height = 3

- prev_height = 0!= 3, add [0, 3]

- prev_height = 3

- Event (2, 3, 'end'):

- Remove -3 from heap

- Current max height = 3 (since the next start is at the same x)

- prev_height = 3 == 3, no change

- Event (2, 3,'start'):

- Add -3 to heap

- Current max height = 3

- prev_height = 3 == 3, no change

- Event (5, 3, 'end'):

- Remove -3 from heap

- Current max height = 0

- prev_height = 3!= 0, add [5, 0]

- prev_height = 0

Skyline: [[0,3],[5,0]]

Correct.

Another consideration: if multiple buildings start at the same x-coordinate, I need to add their heights in descending order. That's why in sorting the events, I need to sort start events by height descending.

Now, in Python, when sorting events, I need to define the key appropriately.

Let's define the events as tuples: (x, height, type), where type is'start' or 'end'.

For sorting:

- If x is the same, start events come before end events.

- Among start events with the same x, higher heights come first.

So, the sort key can be:

- For start events: (x, -height)

- For end events: (x, float('inf'))

Wait, but in Python, I can define a custom sort key.

Let me define the events as tuples: (x, height, type), where type is 0 for start and 1 for end.

Then, sort key can be:

- For start events: (x, -height)

- For end events: (x, float('inf'))

But perhaps a better way is to sort all events by x, and then by type (start before end), and among start events, by -height.

In code, I can define the sort key as:

key=(x, type, -height if type == 0 else height)

Wait, but for end events, I don't care about height order, just need to process them after start events at the same x.

Actually, for end events, I can set the height to be negative or something, but it's not necessary.

Let me think differently.

In Python, I can define the events as tuples: (x, height, type), where type is'start' or 'end'.

Then, sort the events using the key:

key=(x, type, -height if type =='start' else height)

This way, for start events, higher heights come first, and for end events, lower heights come first, but since end events are processed after start events at the same x, the order among end events doesn't matter much.

Alternatively, I can map'start' to 0 and 'end' to 1, and sort by (x, type, -height if type == 0 else height).

This should work.

Now, for the heap, I'll use a list to represent the heap, with negative heights.

To remove a height from the heap, since it's a min-heap, I need to keep track of which heights are to be removed.

But in this approach, since I'm processing events in order and removing only the top height when an end event occurs, it should be manageable.

Let me try to write some pseudocode first.

Pseudocode:

def getSkyline(buildings):

events = []

for left, right, height in buildings:

events.append((left, height,'start'))

events.append((right, height, 'end'))

# Sort events:

# - by x ascending

# - if x same, start before end

# - if x and type same, start heights descending

events.sort(key=lambda e: (e[0], e[2], -e[1] if e[2] =='start' else e[1]))

skyline = []

heap = []  # max-heap of heights, store negative heights

prev_height = 0

for event in events:

x, height, type in event

if type =='start':

heapq.heappush(heap, -height)

elif type == 'end':

# Remove height from heap

heap.remove(-height)

# Since heap.remove is O(n), which is inefficient,

# better to use a separate set to mark heights to be removed

# But for simplicity, assuming no duplicate heights for one building

heapq.heapify(heap)

current_height = -heap[0] if heap else 0

if current_height!= prev_height:

skyline.append([x, current_height])

prev_height = current_height

return skyline

Wait, but `heap.remove` is O(n), which is inefficient for a large number of buildings.

To optimize this, I need a better way to remove elements from the heap efficiently.

One common approach is to use a heap along with a separate set to track which elements have been removed.

I can keep a set of ""to_remove"" and only pop elements from the heap if they are not in ""to_remove"".

But this can get complicated.

Another approach is to use a heap and a separate list to keep track of expired heights.

Here's an improved plan:

- Use a heap to store the active heights, with negative values to simulate a max-heap.

- Use a list to store the ends of the buildings, sorted by end x-coordinate.

- As I sweep through the x-coordinates:

- Add starts to the heap.

- Remove ends that have been reached from the heap.

- Determine the current maximum height from the heap.

- If the current maximum height changes, add a key point to the skyline.

Wait, but removing from the heap is still tricky because heaps don't support efficient removal of arbitrary elements.

Let me look for a better way.

I found that a standard approach in computational geometry for the skyline problem is to:

- Collect all start and end x-coordinates, sorted in ascending order.

- Use a sweep line that moves from left to right.

- Maintain a priority queue (max-heap) of the heights of buildings that the sweep line is currently intersecting.

- At each start event, add the building's height to the heap.

- At each end event, remove the building's height from the heap.

- Keep track of the current maximum height and add a key point to the skyline whenever the maximum height changes.

The tricky part is removing heights from the heap efficiently.

A common optimization is to process all events at the same x-coordinate before updating the skyline.

Specifically:

- For a given x, process all start events, adding heights to the heap.

- Then, process all end events, removing heights from the heap.

- After processing all events at that x, the top of the heap will be the current maximum height.

- If this height is different from the previous height, add a key point to the skyline.

Wait, but removing specific elements from the heap is still an issue.

Another idea is to process all start events first, then all end events, but that wouldn't work because ends need to be processed in relation to the current sweep line position.

I need a way to efficiently remove elements from the heap without iterating through the entire heap each time.

An alternative approach is to use a balanced binary search tree (BST) to store the active heights, which allows for logarithmic time insertions and deletions.

In Python, the `bisect` module can be used with a list to maintain a sorted order, but it doesn't support efficient deletions.

Alternatively, I can use the `bisect` module to manage a sorted list of heights, but deletions are O(n).

Given the constraints (up to 10,000 buildings), efficiency is important.

Wait, perhaps I can use a combination of a heap and a list to track removed items.

Here's an idea:

- Use a max-heap to store the active heights (negative heights for min-heap simulation).

- Use a separate list to track heights that have been removed but not yet popped from the heap.

- When removing a height, add it to the removed list.

- Before determining the current maximum height, check if the top of the heap is in the removed list. If it is, pop it and continue until the top is not in the removed list.

This way, the heap always has the current maximum height at the top, after removing any expired heights.

This approach is known as a ""lazy"" deletion, because we don't remove heights immediately; we just mark them for removal and remove them only when they become the top of the heap.

This should work efficiently, as each height is pushed and popped from the heap at most once, and checking for removal is O(1) if we use a set for the removed heights.

Let's refine this:

- Use a max-heap to store the active heights (with negative heights).

- Use a set to store heights that have been removed but not yet popped from the heap.

- When a building ends, add its height to the removed set.

- When determining the current maximum height, check if the top of the heap is in the removed set. If it is, pop it and continue until the top is not in the removed set.

- The current maximum height is then -heap[0].

This should handle the removals efficiently.

Let's try this approach with the first example.

**Example 1 Revisited:**

Events sorted as before.

Initialize:

- heap: empty

- removed: empty set

- prev_height = 0

- skyline: empty list

Process events:

1. (2, 10,'start')

- heap.push(-10)

- current_height = -heap[0] = 10

- prev_height = 0!= 10, add [2,10]

- prev_height = 10

2. (3, 15,'start')

- heap.push(-15)

- current_height = -heap[0] = 15

- prev_height = 10!= 15, add [3,15]

- prev_height = 15

3. (5, 12,'start')

- heap.push(-12)

- current_height = -heap[0] = 15

- prev_height = 15 == 15, no change

4. (7, 15, 'end')

- removed.add(15)

- current_height = -heap[0] = 15 (but 15 is in removed)

- pop heap (remove -15)

- now heap[0] = -12, which is not in removed

- current_height = 12

- prev_height = 15!= 12, add [7,12]

- prev_height = 12

5. (9, 10, 'end')

- removed.add(10)

- current_height = -heap[0] = 12 (10 is in removed, but 12 is not)

- prev_height = 12 == 12, no change

6. (12, 12, 'end')

- removed.add(12)

- current_height = -heap[0] = 12 (but 12 is in removed)

- pop heap (remove -12)

- heap is now empty

- current_height = 0

- prev_height = 12!= 0, add [12,0]

- prev_height = 0

7. (15, 10,'start')

- heap.push(-10)

- current_height = -heap[0] = 10

- prev_height = 0!= 10, add [15,10]

- prev_height = 10

8. (19, 8,'start')

- heap.push(-8)

- current_height = -heap[0] = 10

- prev_height = 10 == 10, no change

9. (20, 10, 'end')

- removed.add(10)

- current_height = -heap[0] = 10 (but 10 is in removed)

- pop heap (remove -10)

- now heap[0] = -8

- current_height = 8

- prev_height = 10!= 8, add [20,8]

- prev_height = 8

10. (24, 8, 'end')

- removed.add(8)

- current_height = -heap[0] = 8 (but 8 is in removed)

- pop heap (remove -8)

- heap is now empty

- current_height = 0

- prev_height = 8!= 0, add [24,0]

- prev_height = 0

Skyline: [[2,10],[3,15],[7,12],[12,0],[15,10],[20,8],[24,0]]

Correct again.

This seems to work.

Now, in Python, to implement this, I need to:

- Use a list for the heap.

- Use a set to track removed heights.

- Use `heapq` functions to handle the heap.

- Remember to store negative heights in the heap to simulate a max-heap.

- Handle the removal by checking if the top of the heap is in the removed set, and popping it if it is.

- Keep track of the previous height and add key points to the skyline when the height changes.

Edge Cases to Consider:

1. **Single Building**: Only one building, so the skyline should be [[left, height], [right, 0]].

2. **Overlapping Buildings**: Buildings that overlap in both horizontal and vertical directions.

3. **Buildings with the Same Heights**: Ensure that heights are handled correctly when buildings start and end at the same x-coordinate.

4. **Buildings with Large Coordinates**: Ensure no integer overflow or precision issues, as coordinates can be up to 2^31 - 1.

5. **Multiple Buildings Ending at the Same X**: Need to remove multiple heights from the heap.

6. **Ground Between Buildings**: Ensure that the skyline includes the ground level between buildings.

7. **Buildings with Zero Height**: Although heights are specified to be at least 1, so no need to handle zero heights.

8. **Large Number of Buildings**: Up to 10,000 buildings, so the solution needs to be efficient.

I should test the implementation with these edge cases to ensure correctness.

Now, let's proceed to implement the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to compute the skyline of a city given the locations and heights of all its buildings. The skyline is represented as a list of key points sorted by their x-coordinate, where each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline.

### Approach

1. **Event Points**: Create a list of events where each event is either the start or end of a building. Each event contains the x-coordinate, height, and type ('start' or 'end').

2. **Sort Events**: Sort these events by x-coordinate. If x-coordinates are the same, start events come before end events, and among start events, higher heights come before lower heights.

3. **Active Heights**: Use a heap to keep track of the active heights of buildings intersected by the sweep line. This heap will help in efficiently getting the current maximum height.

4. **Track Skyline**: As we process each event, update the active heights and check if the maximum height changes. If it does, add the current x-coordinate and the new height to the skyline.

Otherwise, we add the number along with its latest index to the Hashtable and continue with the next element. If the loop finishes without finding such a pair, we return `false`.

   - If the difference is less than or equal to `k`, return `True`.
   - Update the dictionary with the current index for the element.

The idea is to construct an auxiliary size matrix `dp` where each cell `dp[i][j]` represents the size of the side of the largest square sub-matrix ending at cell `(i, j)` in the given matrix.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialization**: Create a 2D list `dp` of the same dimensions as the input matrix, initialized with 0's. This `dp` matrix will help us keep track of the size of the largest square that can be formed ending at each cell.

2. **Base Case**: For the first row and the first column of the `dp` matrix, the value will be the same as the input matrix because the largest square that can be formed at these positions can only be of size 1x1 if the cell contains '1'.

3. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: For each cell `(i, j)` in the matrix (starting from `(1,1)`), if the cell contains '1', then the value of `dp[i][j]` can be computed as the minimum of its adjacent cells `dp[i-1][j]`, `dp[i][j-1]`, and `dp[i-1][j-1]` plus 1. This is because for a square to be formed, all the three cells above, left, and diagonally left-up must be parts of some squares already, and the new cell can extend the square by one.

4. **Track the Maximum Side Length**: While updating the `dp` matrix, keep track of the maximum value in the `dp` matrix, which represents the side length of the largest square.

5. **Compute the Area**: Finally, the area of the largest square will be the square of the maximum side length found.

     - The length of the overlap is `min(ax2, bx2) - max(ax1, bx1)`.
     - If this value is negative, there is no overlap on the x-axis.
   - Calculate the overlap on the y-axis:
     - The overlapping segment on the y-axis is from `max(ay1, by1)` to `min(ay2, by2)`.
     - The height of the overlap is `min(ay2, by2) - max(ay1, by1)`.
     - If this value is negative, there is no overlap on the y-axis.
   - If there is overlap on both axes, the area of the overlap is the product of the overlapping lengths on both axes.

   - The total area covered by both rectangles is the sum of their areas minus the area of their overlap (if any).

So, you need to implement a basic calculator that can evaluate a given mathematical expression represented as a string. The expression can contain digits, plus and minus signs, parentheses, and spaces. Importantly, you cannot use any built-in functions like `eval()` to directly compute the result.

Let's break down the problem and think about how to approach it step by step.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Expression**:
   - The expression is a valid mathematical expression consisting of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and spaces.
   - We need to handle both addition and subtraction, as well as nested parentheses.

2. **Handling Parentheses**:
   - Parentheses can nest, so we need a way to evaluate expressions inside parentheses first.
   - A stack can be useful for handling nested structures.

3. **Tracking Signs**:
   - We need to keep track of the current sign before numbers.
   - Initially, the sign is positive.
   - When we encounter a '-', the sign flips.

4. **Building the Calculator**:
   - We'll iterate through the string, keeping track of the current number, the current sign, and using a stack to handle parentheses.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the stack using only one queue? John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","I can definitely help you with that! So, the task is to implement a stack using two queues, and optionally, think about how to do it with just one queue. Let's break this down.

First, let's recall what a stack and a queue are:

- A **stack** is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. That means the last element you add is the first one to be removed. Operations are typically `push` (to add an element), `pop` (to remove the top element), `top` (to look at the top element without removing it), and `empty` (to check if the stack is empty).

- A **queue** is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure. The first element added is the first one to be removed. Standard queue operations include `enqueue` (add to the end), `dequeue` (remove from the front), `peek` (look at the front without removing), and `isEmpty`.

So, the challenge here is to use queues (which are FIFO) to simulate a stack (which is LIFO).

### Approach with Two Queues

Let's start by thinking about how two queues can be used to achieve the LIFO behavior of a stack.

1. **Push Operation**:
   - When we push an element into the stack, it should be placed at the top, meaning it should be the first one to be popped out.
   - With queues being FIFO, the newest element needs to be at the front of the queue to be popped out first.
   - To achieve this, we can have two queues, say `q1` and `q2`. We'll use `q1` as the main stack queue, and `q2` as a helper.

   Here's how the push operation can work:
   - Add the new element to `q2`.
   - Move all elements from `q1` to `q2`, one by one.
   - Swap the names of `q1` and `q2`. Now, `q1` has the new element at the front, followed by the older elements.

2. **Pop Operation**:
   - Since `q1` has the newest element at the front, we can simply dequeue from `q1` to perform a pop operation.

3. **Top Operation**:
   - Similar to pop, but instead of removing, we just peek at the front of `q1`.

4. **Empty Operation**:
   - Check if `q1` is empty.

This approach ensures that the push operation is a bit more involved, but pop, top, and empty are straightforward.

The expression consists of non-negative integers and the operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`, with division truncating towards zero. The expression is guaranteed to be valid, and we need to handle the operator precedence correctly,即 multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.

### Approach

1. **Tokenization**: First, we need to tokenize the input string into numbers and operators, ignoring spaces.
2. **Operator Precedence**: Since multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction, we need to handle them first.
3. **Using Stacks**: We can use a stack to handle the operations. We'll iterate through the tokens, perform multiplication and division immediately, and store addition and subtraction operations to be handled later.
4. **Final Calculation**: After handling all multiplication and division, we'll perform addition and subtraction on the accumulated values.

    The algorithm involves iterating through the input array and using a variable named `start` to keep track of the beginning of the current range. For each element, we compare it with the previous element to check if they form a continuous range by verifying if the current element is greater than the previous element plus 1. If they don't form a continuous range, we know that the current range has ended and a new range starts at the current element. So, we add the current range to the result in the required format and update the start variable to the current element. This process continues until all elements are processed. Finally, we add the last range to the result in the required format.

I have a sorted unique integer array, and I need to return the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array exactly. Each range should be in the form ""a->b"" if a!= b, or just ""a"" if a == b.

Okay, so first things first, the array is sorted and contains unique integers. That makes things a bit easier because I don't have to worry about duplicates or sorting it myself.

Let me look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,2,4,5,7]

Output: [""0->2"", ""4->5"", ""7""]

So, here, the numbers 0,1,2 are consecutive, so they form one range ""0->2"". Then 4 and 5 are consecutive, so ""4->5"", and 7 is by itself, so ""7"".

In Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,2,3,4,6,8,9]

Output: [""0"", ""2->4"", ""6"", ""8->9""]

Again, 0 is by itself, 2,3,4 are consecutive, 6 is by itself, and 8,9 are consecutive.

So, the key here is to identify consecutive sequences in the array and group them into ranges.

Since the array is sorted, I can iterate through it and check if the current number is consecutive to the previous one. If it is, I continue expanding the current range. If it's not, I close the current range and start a new one.

I need to handle the case where there's only one number in a range, in which case I just include that number as a string.

Also, I need to make sure that the output list is sorted, but since the input array is already sorted, and I'm processing it in order, the output should naturally be sorted.

Let me think about the steps I need to take:

1. Initialize an empty list to hold the range strings.

2. Handle the case where the input array is empty. In that case, return an empty list.

3. Initialize variables to track the start and end of the current range.

4. Iterate through the array starting from the first element.

5. Set the start of the range to the first element.

6. Then, for each subsequent element, check if it's consecutive to the previous one (i.e., nums[i] == nums[i-1] + 1).

7. If it is, continue to the next element and update the end of the range.

8. If it's not, then add the current range to the list (in the format ""start->end"" if start!= end, otherwise ""start""), and set the start and end to the current element.

9. After the loop ends, make sure to add the last range to the list.

I should also be careful with integer overflow, as the constraints mention that nums[i] can be as low as -2^31 and as high as 2^31 - 1. But since Python handles big integers well, I don't need to worry about overflow in this case.

Let me try to write some pseudocode to visualize this:","def summaryRanges(nums):

    The algorithm maintains a count of occurrences of each element in the given array using a hash table. For each element, it increments its count in the hash table. If the count for the current element exceeds `n/3`, and the element is not already in the result array, it adds the element to the result array.

So, the task is to find all elements in an integer array that appear more than `⌊n/3⌋` times, where n is the length of the array. Let's break this down.

First, I need to understand what `⌊n/3⌋` means. The floor division of n by 3 gives us the largest integer less than or equal to n/3. So, any element that appears more than this value is what we're interested in.

Let's look at the examples to get a better grasp:

1. For nums = [3,2,3], n = 3, ⌊3/3⌋ = 1. So, we're looking for elements that appear more than 1 time. In this case, 3 appears twice, so the output is [3].

2. For nums = [1], n = 1, ⌊1/3⌋ = 0. So, we're looking for elements that appear more than 0 times. Since 1 appears once, which is more than 0, the output is [1].

3. For nums = [1,2], n = 2, ⌊2/3⌋ = 0. Both 1 and 2 appear once, which is more than 0, so the output is [1,2].

From these examples, it seems like if an element appears at least ⌊n/3⌋ + 1 times, it should be included in the result.

Now, thinking about the constraints:

- The array can be as large as 5 * 10^4 elements, so we need an efficient solution.

- Elements can be any integer between -10^9 and 10^9.

Given the size of the array, we need a solution that runs in linear time, if possible, to handle large inputs efficiently.

The follow-up question asks if we can solve it in linear time and O(1) space. That sounds challenging, but let's see.

First, I'll consider the brute force approach:

- Count the frequency of each element using a hash map.

- Iterate through the hash map and collect elements that have a count greater than ⌊n/3⌋.

This approach is straightforward, but its space complexity is O(n) because of the hash map, which may not meet the O(1) space requirement.

Is there a way to reduce the space complexity?

I recall that for finding a single element that appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times, we can use the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, which operates in O(1) space. Maybe there's a variation of this algorithm that can be applied to this problem.

After some research, I find that the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm can be extended to find up to k-1 elements that appear more than ⌊n/k⌋ times in an array. In this case, k=3, so we can find up to 2 elements that appear more than ⌊n/3⌋ times.

Let me try to understand this extension.

The idea is to maintain up to k-1 candidates and their counts. Since k=3, we can have up to 2 candidates.

We'll iterate through the array and do the following:

1. If the current element matches one of the candidates, increment that candidate's count.

2. If the current element doesn't match any candidate and there are less than k-1 candidates, add it as a new candidate with a count of 1.

3. If the current element doesn't match any candidate and there are already k-1 candidates, decrement the counts of all candidates by 1.

The rationale is that if there are elements that appear more than ⌊n/k⌋ times, they should survive this process.

After the first pass, the candidates we have might include elements that appear more than ⌊n/k⌋ times, but we need to verify their actual counts because the algorithm doesn't guarantee that they indeed appear more than ⌊n/k⌋ times.

So, in a second pass, we'll count the frequency of each candidate and include only those that appear more than ⌊n/k⌋ times.

This approach should work in O(n) time and O(1) space, since we're only storing a constant number of candidates.

Let me try to implement this logic step by step.

First, initialize two variables to hold the candidates and their counts, since k=3 and k-1=2.

Then, iterate through the array:

- For each element, check if it matches candidate1 or candidate2. If it does, increment the respective count.

- If it doesn't match and both candidates are already assigned, decrement both counts.

- If a candidate's count reaches zero, replace that candidate with the current element and set its count to 1.

After the first pass, collect the candidates and in a second pass, count their frequencies to confirm they appear more than ⌊n/3⌋ times.

Let's test this logic with the first example:

nums = [3,2,3]

- Initialize candidate1 = None, candidate2 = None

- First element: 3

- No candidates, set candidate1 = 3, count1 = 1

- Second element: 2

- Doesn't match candidate1, set candidate2 = 2, count2 = 1

- Third element: 3

- Matches candidate1, increment count1 to 2

After first pass, candidates are 3 and 2

Second pass:

- Count of 3: 2

- Count of 2: 1

- ⌊3/3⌋ = 1, so only 3 appears more than 1 time.

Result: [3]

Seems correct.

Another example:

nums = [1]

- Initialize candidate1 = None, candidate2 = None

- First element: 1

- No candidates, set candidate1 = 1, count1 = 1

After first pass, candidate is 1

Second pass:

- Count of 1: 1

- ⌊1/3⌋ = 0, so 1 appears more than 0 times.

Result: [1]

Correct.

Another example:

nums = [1,2]

- Initialize candidate1 = None, candidate2 = None

- First element: 1

- No candidates, set candidate1 = 1, count1 = 1

- Second element: 2

- Doesn't match candidate1, set candidate2 = 2, count2 = 1

After first pass, candidates are 1 and 2

Second pass:

- Count of 1: 1

- Count of 2: 1

- ⌊2/3⌋ = 0, so both appear more than 0 times.

Result: [1,2]

Correct.

Seems like this approach works for these examples.

Now, let's think about edge cases.

Edge case 1:

nums = [1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2]

n = 8, ⌊8/3⌋ = 2, so elements appearing more than 2 times are candidates.

Expected output: [1,2] because both appear 3 times.

Let's apply the algorithm:

- Initialize candidate1 = None, candidate2 = None

- First element: 1

- No candidates, set candidate1 = 1, count1 = 1

- Second element: 1

- Matches candidate1, increment count1 to 2

- Third element: 1

- Matches candidate1, increment count1 to 3

- Fourth element: 3

- Doesn't match any candidate, and both candidates are assigned, so decrement both counts: count1 = 2, count2 = 0

- Fifth element: 3

- Doesn't match any candidate, and candidate2 count is 0, set candidate2 = 3, count2 = 1

- Sixth element: 2

- Doesn't match any candidate, and both candidates are assigned, so decrement both counts: count1 = 1, count2 = 0

- Seventh element: 2

- Doesn't match any candidate, and candidate2 count is 0, set candidate2 = 2, count2 = 1

- Eighth element: 2

- Matches candidate2, increment count2 to 2

After first pass, candidates are 1 and 2

Second pass:

- Count of 1: 3

- Count of 2: 3

- ⌊8/3⌋ = 2, so both appear more than 2 times.

Result: [1,2]

Correct.

Edge case 2:

nums = [1,1,1,1,3,3,3,2,2,2]

n = 10, ⌊10/3⌋ = 3, so elements appearing more than 3 times are candidates.

Expected output: [1,3,2] because all appear 4 times.

Wait, but according to the problem, for k=3, we can have up to k-1=2 candidates. But in this case, all three elements appear more than ⌊10/3⌋ = 3 times.

Hmm, but the algorithm is designed to find up to k-1 elements, but in reality, there can be up to k-1 elements that appear more than ⌊n/k⌋ times. In this case, for k=3, it's possible to have up to two elements appearing more than ⌊n/3⌋ times. But here, all three elements appear 4 times, which is more than 3.

Wait, is there a theorem or something that says that in an array, the number of elements appearing more than ⌊n/k⌋ times is at most k-1?

I think it's called the Generalized Majority Problem, and it's proven that in any list, there can be at most k-1 elements that appear more than ⌊n/k⌋ times.

In this case, for k=3, there can be at most two elements appearing more than ⌊n/3⌋ times.

But in my example, all three elements appear 4 times, which is more than ⌊10/3⌋ = 3 times. Is this possible?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the theorem.

Let me check with actual counts:

- 1 appears 4 times

- 3 appears 4 times

- 2 appears 4 times

Total n = 12, not 10 as I previously thought. Wait, in the array [1,1,1,1,3,3,3,2,2,2], that's 10 elements:

- 1 appears 4 times

- 3 appears 3 times

- 2 appears 3 times

So, ⌊10/3⌋ = 3, elements appearing more than 3 times are only 1, which appears 4 times.

So, expected output is [1]

Let's apply the algorithm:

- Initialize candidate1 = None, candidate2 = None

- First element: 1

- No candidates, set candidate1 = 1, count1 = 1

- Second element: 1

- Matches candidate1, increment count1 to 2

- Third element: 1

- Matches candidate1, increment count1 to 3

- Fourth element: 1

- Matches candidate1, increment count1 to 4

- Fifth element: 3

- Doesn't match any candidate, and both candidates are assigned, so decrement both counts: count1 = 3, count2 = 0

- Sixth element: 3

- Doesn't match any candidate, and candidate2 count is 0, set candidate2 = 3, count2 = 1

- Seventh element: 3

- Matches candidate2, increment count2 to 2

- Eighth element: 2

- Doesn't match any candidate, and both candidates are assigned, so decrement both counts: count1 = 3, count2 = 1

- Ninth element: 2

- Doesn't match any candidate, and both candidates are assigned, so decrement both counts: count1 = 2, count2 = 0

- Tenth element: 2

- Doesn't match any candidate, and candidate2 count is 0, set candidate2 = 2, count2 = 1

After first pass, candidates are 1 and 2

Second pass:

- Count of 1: 4

- Count of 2: 3

- ⌊10/3⌋ = 3, so 1 appears more than 3 times, but 2 appears exactly 3 times, which is not more than 3.

Result: [1]

Correct.

Another edge case:

nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], all elements appear once.

n = 10, ⌊10/3⌋ = 3, so elements appearing more than 3 times.

No element appears more than 3 times, so output is empty list.

Let's apply the algorithm:

- Initialize candidate1 = None, candidate2 = None

- First element: 1

- No candidates, set candidate1 = 1, count1 = 1

- Second element: 2

- Doesn't match candidate1, set candidate2 = 2, count2 = 1

- Third element: 3

- Doesn't match any candidate, decrement both counts: count1 = 0, count2 = 0

- Fourth element: 4

- No candidates, set candidate1 = 4, count1 = 1

- Fifth element: 5

- Doesn't match any candidate, set candidate2 = 5, count2 = 1

- Sixth element: 6

- Doesn't match any candidate, decrement both counts: count1 = 0, count2 = 0

- Seventh element: 7

- No candidates, set candidate1 = 7, count1 = 1

- Eighth element: 8

- Doesn't match any candidate, set candidate2 = 8, count2 = 1

- Ninth element: 9

- Doesn't match any candidate, decrement both counts: count1 = 0, count2 = 0

- Tenth element: 10

- No candidates, set candidate1 = 10, count1 = 1

After first pass, candidates are 10 and 8 (or whatever the last two elements are, but in this process, it's 10 and 8)

Second pass:

- Count of 10: 1

- Count of 8: 1

- Both appear once, which is not more than ⌊10/3⌋ = 3

Result: []

Correct.

Seems like the algorithm works for these cases.

Now, let's think about implementing this in code.

I need to handle the general case where k can be any value, but in this problem, k=3.

So, I'll hardcode k=3 and find up to k-1=2 candidates.

Here's a rough sketch of the code:

def majorityElement(nums):

n = len(nums)

if n == 0:

return []

# Since k=3, we can have up to 2 candidates

candidate1, candidate2 = None, None

count1, count2 = 0, 0

# First pass to find candidates

for num in nums:

if num == candidate1:

count1 += 1

elif num == candidate2:

count2 += 1

elif count1 == 0:

candidate1 = num

count1 = 1

elif count2 == 0:

candidate2 = num

count2 = 1

else:

count1 -= 1

count2 -= 1

# Second pass to confirm candidates

threshold = n // 3

result = []

if count1 > 0:

if nums.count(candidate1) > threshold:

result.append(candidate1)

if count2 > 0:

if nums.count(candidate2) > threshold and candidate2!= candidate1:

result.append(candidate2)

return result

Wait, but in the second pass, instead of using nums.count(), which is O(n) for each candidate, I should iterate through the array once to count both candidates.

Otherwise, the time complexity becomes O(n*k), where k is the number of candidates, which is 2 here, so still O(n), but it's better to make it more efficient.

So, let's refine the second pass.

Here's an improved version:

def majorityElement(nums):

n = len(nums)

if n == 0:

return []

candidate1, candidate2 = None, None

count1, count2 = 0, 0

# First pass to find candidates

for num in nums:

if num == candidate1:

count1 += 1

elif num == candidate2:

count2 += 1

elif count1 == 0:

candidate1 = num

count1 = 1

elif count2 == 0:

candidate2 = num

count2 = 1

else:

count1 -= 1

count2 -= 1

# Second pass to confirm candidates

count1 = 0

count2 = 0

for num in nums:

if num == candidate1:

count1 += 1

elif num == candidate2:

count2 += 1

threshold = n // 3

result = []

if count1 > threshold:

result.append(candidate1)

if count2 > threshold:

result.append(candidate2)

return result

This way, the second pass is O(n), and we're only iterating through the array once for counting.

Also, need to make sure that candidate1 and candidate2 are distinct.

In the second pass, I'm separately counting both candidates, and then checking if their counts are greater than the threshold.

This should work.

Let's test this function with the earlier examples.

Test case 1:

nums = [3,2,3]

Expected output: [3]

Using the function:

First pass:

- num=3: candidate1=3, count1=1

- num=2: candidate2=2, count2=1

- num=3: match candidate1, count1=2

After first pass: candidate1=3, count1=2; candidate2=2, count2=1

Second pass:

- count1=2

- count2=1

Threshold = 3//3 = 1

So, 3 appears more than 1 time, include it.

2 appears once, which is not more than 1.

Result: [3]

Correct.

Test case 2:

nums = [1]

Expected output: [1]

Using the function:

First pass:

- num=1: candidate1=1, count1=1

After first pass: candidate1=1, count1=1; candidate2=None, count2=0

Second pass:

- count1=1

Threshold = 1//3 = 0

So, 1 appears more than 0 times, include it.

Result: [1]

Correct.

Test case 3:

nums = [1,2]

Expected output: [1,2]

Using the function:

First pass:

- num=1: candidate1=1, count1=1

- num=2: candidate2=2, count2=1

After first pass: candidate1=1, count1=1; candidate2=2, count2=1

Second pass:

- count1=1

- count2=1

Threshold = 2//3 = 0

Both appear more than 0 times, include both.

Result: [1,2]

Correct.

Another test case:

nums = [1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2]

Expected output: [1,2]

Using the function:

First pass:

- num=1: candidate1=1, count1=1

- num=1: count1=2

- num=1: count1=3

- num=3: count1=2, count2=0 (decrement)

- num=3: candidate2=3, count2=1

- num=2: count1=1, count2=0 (decrement)

- num=2: candidate2=2, count2=1

- num=2: count2=2

After first pass: candidate1=1, count1=1; candidate2=2, count2=2

Second pass:

- count1=3

- count2=3

Threshold = 8//3 = 2

Both appear more than 2 times, include both.

Result: [1,2]

Correct.

Seems like the function works for these cases.

Now, let's think about optimizing it further.

In the first pass, we're correctly maintaining up to k-1 candidates.

In the second pass, we're counting the frequency of these candidates.

Is there a way to make this more efficient or cleaner?

Alternatively, since k=3 is fixed, we can hardcode the number of candidates as 2.

But in general, for k, we can have up to k-1 candidates.

If we wanted to generalize this for any k, we could modify the function to accept k as a parameter and handle up to k-1 candidates.

But for this problem, k=3, so it's fine to hardcode it.

Another consideration is to handle the case when n=0, which we've already done by returning an empty list.

Also, need to handle when n=1, which we've already handled.

Now, let's think about implementing this in code, making sure to handle all edge cases.

I should also consider if the array has duplicate elements beyond what's specified, but according to the constraints, elements can be any integer, including duplicates.

I should also consider negative numbers, as per the constraints (-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9).

Let's test with negative numbers:

Test case:

nums = [-1, -1, -1, 2, 3]

n = 5, ⌊5/3⌋ = 1, so elements appearing more than once.

Expected output: [-1]

Using the function:

First pass:

- num=-1: candidate1=-1, count1=1

- num=-1: count1=2

- num=-1: count1=3

- num=2: count1=2, count2=0 (decrement)

- num=3: candidate2=3, count2=1

After first pass: candidate1=-1, count1=2; candidate2=3, count2=1

Second pass:

- count1=3

- count2=1

Threshold = 1

So, -1 appears more than once, include it.

3 appears once, which is not more than once.

Result: [-1]

Correct.

Another test case with negatives:

nums = [-1, -1, 2, 2, 3, 3]

n=6, ⌊6/3⌋=2, so elements appearing more than twice.

Expected output: [] because no element appears more than twice.

Using the function:

First pass:

- num=-1: candidate1=-1, count1=1

- num=-1: count1=2

- num=2: candidate2=2, count2=1

- num=2: count2=2

- num=3: count1=1, count2=1 (decrement both)

- num=3: candidate2=3, count2=1

After first pass: candidate1=-1, count1=1; candidate2=3, count2=1

Second pass:

- count1=2

- count2=1

Threshold=2

So, no element appears more than twice.

Result: []

Correct.

Seems solid.

Now, let's think about the time and space complexity.

Time Complexity:

- First pass: O(n)

- Second pass: O(n)

- Overall: O(n)

Space Complexity:

- Only using a constant amount of space for candidates and counts: O(1)

Which meets the follow-up requirement.

Is there any way to make this more efficient or cleaner?

Perhaps, but I think this is a good solution.

Now, let's think about implementing this in code, making sure to handle all edge cases.

I should also consider if the array is empty, which according to the constraints, n >=1, but in the code above, I handled n=0. Maybe I can remove that case.

Constraints say 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4, so n >=1.

So, I can adjust the code accordingly.

Also, need to make sure that candidate1 and candidate2 are distinct.

In the second pass, I need to check that candidate2 is not equal to candidate1 when adding it to the result.

Already handled that in the code.

Another consideration is to avoid counting candidate2 if it's the same as candidate1.

But in the code above, I'm checking if candidate2!= candidate1 before appending it.

Seems fine.

I think this should work.

Now, let's proceed to implement this in code.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to identify all elements in an array that appear more than `⌊ n/3 ⌋` times, where n is the length of the array. This solution uses an extension of the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm to efficiently find these elements in linear time and constant space.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**: We initialize two candidates and two counts to track the potential elements that appear more than `⌊ n/3 ⌋` times.
2. **First Pass**: Traverse the array to determine the candidates:
   - If the current element matches one of the candidates, increment that candidate's count.
   - If the current element doesn't match any candidate and there are vacancies for new candidates, set the current element as a new candidate.
   - If the current element doesn't match any candidate and there are no vacancies, decrement the counts of the current candidates.
3. **Second Pass**: Verify the candidates by counting their occurrences in the array to ensure they appear more than `⌊ n/3 ⌋` times.
4. **Result**: Collect and return the candidates that meet the criteria.

    The algorithm uses an iterative approach to perform an in-order traversal of the binary search tree (BST). We make use of a stack to keep track of the visited nodes. Starting with the root node, we traverse the left subtree until we reach the leftmost node, pushing each node onto the stack along the way. 

When we reach a null node, we pop the top of the stack (the leftmost node). This node will be the smallest value in the tree. We continue traversing the right subtrees, decrementing the value of k each time we pop a node from the stack. When the k becomes 0, we return the value of the current node – this is the kth smallest element.

We repeat the traversal until the desired kth smallest element is found. The time complexity is O(H + k) where H is the height of the tree.

    The algorithm checks if the given integer n is a power of two. First, we check if n is a negative number or zero, in which case it cannot be a power of two, so we return false. 

If n is positive, we can use bitwise manipulation to check if it's a power of two. A power of two in binary representation has only one bit set to 1 (e.g., 1: 001, 2: 010, 4: 100, 8: 1000). When we subtract 1 from a power of two, all the bits from the right of the set bit become 1 (e.g., 1-1: 000, 2-1: 001, 4-1: 011, 8-1: 0111). 

By performing bitwise AND operation (n & (n-1)) between n and (n-1), we can check if there is only one bit set in n. If the result is 0, that means there is no overlapping bit between n and (n-1), indicating that n is a power of two; returning true. Otherwise, return false.

### Approach
1. **Understanding Powers of Two**:
   - Powers of two in binary representation have only one '1' bit and all other bits are '0'. For example:
     - 1 (decimal) is 1 (binary)
     - 2 (decimal) is 10 (binary)
     - 4 (decimal) is 100 (binary)
     - 8 (decimal) is 1000 (binary)
     - etc.
   - This property can be used to check if a number is a power of two.

2. **Bitwise Operation**:
   - A number `n` is a power of two if and only if `n` and `(n - 1)` have no common set bits. In other words, `n & (n - 1)` should be zero.
   - Also, `n` should be greater than zero because zero and negative numbers are not powers of two.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - `n = 1` is `2^0`, which is a power of two.
   - `n = 0` is not a power of two.
   - Negative numbers are not powers of two.

When we need to pop or peek the front element, we check if stack2 is empty; if so, pop all elements from stack1 and push them to stack2. The front element of the queue then would be on the top of the stack2. If stack2 is not empty, just pop or peek the top element of stack2.

To check if the queue is empty, we just need to check if both the stacks are empty.

By doing this, we are maintaining stack2 as the reversed version of stack1, which allows us to access the elements in the correct order for a queue (FIFO).
    ","Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyQueue` class:

*   `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
*   `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
*   `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

*   You must use **only** standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
*   Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ ""MyQueue "",  ""push "",  ""push "",  ""peek "",  ""pop "",  ""empty ""\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 1, 1, false\]

**Explanation**
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: \[1\]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: \[1, 2\] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is \[2\]
myQueue.empty(); // return false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= x <= 9`
*   At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`.
*   All the calls to `pop` and `peek` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the queue such that each operation is **[amortized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis)** `O(1)` time complexity? In other words, performing `n` operations will take overall `O(n)` time even if one of those operations may take longer. Additionally, the sky was clear that day.","To implement a queue using two stacks in Python, we need to simulate the FIFO (First In First Out) behavior using the LIFO (Last In First Out) nature of stacks. We will use two stacks: one for pushing elements (`input_stack`) and another for popping elements (`output_stack`).

### Approach

1. **Push Operation:**
   - Simply push the element onto `input_stack`.

2. **Pop Operation:**
   - If `output_stack` is empty, pop all elements from `input_stack` and push them onto `output_stack`. This reverses the order, making the oldest element in `input_stack` the top element in `output_stack`.
   - Pop the top element from `output_stack`.

3. **Peek Operation:**
   - Similar to pop, but instead of popping, just peek the top element of `output_stack`.

4. **Empty Operation:**
   - Check if both `input_stack` and `output_stack` are empty.

   - If all corresponding values are equal, the list is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.

   - If the list has an odd number of elements, the middle element should be ignored in the comparison. This is handled by moving the second pointer (for the second half) one step ahead after reversing.

I'm given that the tree is a BST, which means that for any node, all nodes in its left subtree are less than the node, and all nodes in its right subtree are greater than the node. This property should help me in finding the LCA efficiently.

First, I need to understand what the lowest common ancestor is. According to the definition, it's the lowest node in the tree that has both p and q as descendants. Importantly, a node can be a descendant of itself, so if p is an ancestor of q, then p is the LCA.

Given that we're dealing with a BST, I can leverage the properties of the BST to traverse the tree and find the LCA without having to check every node.

Let me think about how I can approach this.

I start at the root. If both p and q are less than the root, then they must be in the left subtree, so I can move to the left child. If both are greater than the root, they must be in the right subtree, so I can move to the right child. If one is less and the other is greater, or if one of them is equal to the root, then the root is the LCA.

Wait, let me formalize this:

1. Start from the root.

2. If p.val and q.val are both less than root.val, then the LCA must be in the left subtree. So, set root to root.left.

3. If p.val and q.val are both greater than root.val, then the LCA must be in the right subtree. So, set root to root.right.

4. If p.val <= root.val and q.val >= root.val, or p.val >= root.val and q.val <= root.val, then root is the LCA.

I need to make sure that I handle the case where p or q is equal to root, which should still consider root as the LCA.

Let me consider some examples to verify this logic.

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8

*   The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
*   All the values before `node` should be in the same order.
*   All the values after `node` should be in the same order.

**Custom testing:**

*   For the input, you should provide the entire linked list `head` and the node to be given `node`. `node` should not be the last node of the list and should be an actual node in the list.
*   We will build the linked list and pass the node to your function.
*   The output will be the entire list after calling your function.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = \[4,5,1,9\], node = 5
**Output:** \[4,1,9\]
**Explanation:** You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = \[4,5,1,9\], node = 1
**Output:** \[4,5,9\]
**Explanation:** You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
*   The value of each node in the list is **unique**.
*   The `node` to be deleted is **in the list** and is **not a tail** node. Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","Alright, I've got this problem to solve. So, there's a singly-linked list, and I need to delete a specific node from it. But here's the twist: I'm only given access to the node I need to delete, not the head of the list. That means I can't traverse the list from the beginning to find the previous node and adjust its next pointer. Hmm, interesting challenge.

First, I need to understand what a singly-linked list is. Each node has some data and a next pointer that points to the next node in the sequence. Since it's singly-linked, each node only has a pointer to the next node, not to the previous one. That's why I can't access the node before the one I need to delete.

The problem says that all values in the list are unique, and the node I need to delete is not the last node. So, I don't have to worry about dealing with the tail of the list or handling duplicate values.

My task is to delete the node, which means that after my function is called, the value of the given node should no longer exist in the list, and the list should have one less node. Also, the order of the remaining nodes should remain the same.

Since I don't have access to the previous node, I can't change the next pointer of the previous node to skip the current one. So, I need to find another way to delete the node.

Wait a minute, maybe I can copy the value of the next node into the current node and then remove the next node. That way, the value of the current node is replaced with the value of the next node, and the next node is effectively removed.

Let me think about this. Suppose I have a list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, and I need to delete node 2. If I copy the value of node 3 into node 2, the list becomes 1 -> 3 -> 3 -> 4. Then, if I remove the next node (which is the second 3), the list becomes 1 -> 3 -> 4, which is what I want.

Yes, that seems to work. So, in code, I would set the value of the current node to be the value of its next node, and then set the next pointer of the current node to point to the node after the next one.

In other words:

node.val = node.next.val

node.next = node.next.next

That should do the trick. Let me test this logic with the example given.

Example 1:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5

After deleting node 5, the list should be [4,1,9].

Following my logic:

Set node.val = node.next.val = 1

Set node.next = node.next.next = 9

So, the list becomes 4 -> 1 -> 9, which matches the expected output.

Example 2:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1

After deleting node 1, the list should be [4,5,9].

Following my logic:

Set node.val = node.next.val = 9

Set node.next = node.next.next = None (since 9 is the last node)

So, the list becomes 4 -> 5 -> 9, which matches the expected output.

Great, it seems to work for these cases. But I should consider if there are any edge cases that might break this logic.

First, the problem states that the node to be deleted is not the last node. So, I don't need to handle the case where the node to be deleted is the last one.

Another consideration is that the list has at least two nodes, as per the constraints.

Also, all values are unique, so I don't have to worry about duplicate values.

Given these constraints, my approach should work.

Now, I need to implement this in Python. I'll assume that the Node class is defined with val and next attributes.

So, the function signature might look like this:

def deleteNode(node: ListNode) -> None:

And inside the function, I'll perform the steps I outlined earlier.

Let me write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to delete a node from a singly-linked list given only access to that node. We cannot access the head of the list, and we need to ensure that the value of the given node is removed from the list, the number of nodes decreases by one, and the order of the remaining nodes remains unchanged.

### Approach
1. **Copy Value**: Copy the value of the next node into the current node.
2. **Adjust Pointer**: Set the next pointer of the current node to skip the next node and directly point to the node after the next one.

This effectively removes the next node, which holds the copied value, and since the current node now holds the value of the next node, the list appears to have the given node deleted.

    The basic idea is to create an array `answer` with the same size as `nums`. We start by initializing all elements of the `answer` array to 1.

We then perform two passes through the `nums` array. During the first pass, we keep track of the running product of elements to the left of the current index in a variable called `left`, and we multiply the corresponding element in the `answer` array by this running product.

During the second pass, we move in the reverse direction, and we perform a similar operation for the elements to the right of the current index using a variable called `right`. This will result in `answer[i]` being equal to the product of all elements in the `nums` array except for the current element, `nums[i]`.

Since we only have two passes through the input array, the algorithm has an O(n) time complexity.

**Follow up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity? (The output array **does not** count as extra space for space complexity analysis.) John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","I've got this problem here. I need to find the product of all elements in an array except for the one at the current index, and I have to do it in O(n) time without using division. Also, I need to make sure it fits in a 32-bit integer, but I think that's more about the constraints rather than something I need to handle specifically in the code.

First, I need to understand the problem fully. Given an array like [1,2,3,4], the output should be [24,12,8,6], where each element is the product of all others except itself. So for index 0, it's 2*3*4=24, for index 1 it's 1*3*4=12, and so on.

The straightforward way would be to calculate the product of the entire array and then divide by each element, but division is not allowed. So, I need another approach.

I recall that we can think about the product of all elements to the left and to the right of each element and then multiply those two products together for each index.

For example, for the array [1,2,3,4]:

- Left products: [1, 1, 1*2, 1*2*3] = [1,1,2,6]

- Right products: [2*3*4, 3*4, 4, 1] = [24,12,4,1]

- Then, for each index, multiply the corresponding left and right products:

  - Index 0: 1 * 24 = 24

  - Index 1: 1 * 12 = 12

  - Index 2: 2 * 4 = 8

  - Index 3: 6 * 1 = 6

This seems promising. So, I can create two arrays: one for the left products and one for the right products, and then multiply them element-wise to get the final result.

But the follow-up question asks if I can do it in O(1) extra space, not including the output array. That means I need to compute the result without creating these two additional arrays.

Hmm, maybe I can compute the left products and right products on the fly and directly compute the result without storing them separately.

Let me think about this. I can initialize the output array with all 1s, and then in a first pass, multiply each element by the product of the elements to its left, accumulating the product as I go. Then, in a second pass from the right, multiply each element by the product of the elements to its right, again accumulating the product as I go.

This way, the output array itself holds the product of all elements except itself, by combining the left and right products.

Let's try this with the example:

nums = [1,2,3,4]

Initialize output = [1,1,1,1]

First pass (left to right):

- Initialize left_product = 1

- Index 0: output[0] = 1 * 1 = 1, left_product = 1

- Index 1: output[1] = 1 * 1 = 1, left_product = 1 * 1 = 1

- Index 2: output[2] = 1 * 2 = 2, left_product = 1 * 2 = 2

- Index 3: output[3] = 1 * 6 = 6, left_product = 2 * 3 = 6

Second pass (right to left):

- Initialize right_product = 1

- Index 3: output[3] = 6 * 1 = 6, right_product = 1

- Index 2: output[2] = 2 * 4 = 8, right_product = 1 * 4 = 4

- Index 1: output[1] = 1 * 12 = 12, right_product = 4 * 3 = 12

- Index 0: output[0] = 1 * 24 = 24, right_product = 12 * 2 = 24

So, the final output is [24,12,8,6], which matches the expected output.

This seems to work. Now, let's consider the second example:

nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]

Initialize output = [1,1,1,1,1]

First pass (left to right):

- Initialize left_product = 1

- Index 0: output[0] = 1 * 1 = 1, left_product = 1

- Index 1: output[1] = 1 * (-1) = -1, left_product = 1 * (-1) = -1

- Index 2: output[2] = 1 * (-1) = -1, left_product = -1 * 1 = -1

- Index 3: output[3] = 1 * (-1) = -1, left_product = -1 * 0 = 0

- Index 4: output[4] = 1 * 0 = 0, left_product = 0 * (-3) = 0

Second pass (right to left):

- Initialize right_product = 1

- Index 4: output[4] = 0 * 1 = 0, right_product = 1

- Index 3: output[3] = -1 * 3 = -3, right_product = 1 * 3 = 3

- Index 2: output[2] = -1 * (-3) = 3, right_product = 3 * (-3) = -9

- Index 1: output[1] = -1 * (-9) = 9, right_product = -9 * 0 = 0

- Index 0: output[0] = 1 * 0 = 0, right_product = 0 * 1 = 0

So, the final output is [0,9,3,-3,0], but according to the example, it should be [0,0,9,0,0]. There's a discrepancy here.

Wait a minute, something's wrong. Let's double-check the calculations.

First pass (left to right):

- Index 0: output[0] = 1 * 1 = 1, left_product = 1

- Index 1: output[1] = 1 * 1 = 1, left_product = 1 * (-1) = -1

- Index 2: output[2] = 1 * (-1) = -1, left_product = -1 * 1 = -1

- Index 3: output[3] = 1 * (-1) = -1, left_product = -1 * 0 = 0

- Index 4: output[4] = 1 * 0 = 0, left_product = 0 * (-3) = 0

Second pass (right to left):

- Initialize right_product = 1

- Index 4: output[4] = 0 * 1 = 0, right_product = 1

- Index 3: output[3] = -1 * 3 = -3, right_product = 1 * 3 = 3

- Index 2: output[2] = -1 * 3 = -3, right_product = 3 * (-3) = -9

- Index 1: output[1] = 1 * (-9) = -9, right_product = -9 * 0 = 0

- Index 0: output[0] = 1 * 0 = 0, right_product = 0 * 1 = 0

Wait, now I get [0, -9, -3, -3, 0], which is still not matching the expected output [0,0,9,0,0]. There must be a mistake in this approach.

Let me think differently. Maybe I need to handle zeros specially, but the problem says to handle them as is, since the product except itself would just exclude the zero.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the number of zeros in the array.

Case 1: No zeros

- Proceed as usual.

Case 2: One zero

- All products except the zero itself will be zero, and for the zero, it will be the product of all other elements.

Case 3: More than one zero

- All products will be zero, since each product will include at least one zero.

But in the approach I was taking, it seems to handle zeros correctly, so maybe I made a calculation error earlier.

Let's try again with nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]

Initialize output = [1,1,1,1,1]

First pass (left to right):

- left_product starts at 1

- Index 0: output[0] = 1 * 1 = 1, left_product = 1 * (-1) = -1

- Index 1: output[1] = 1 * (-1) = -1, left_product = -1 * 1 = -1

- Index 2: output[2] = 1 * (-1) = -1, left_product = -1 * 0 = 0

- Index 3: output[3] = 1 * 0 = 0, left_product = 0 * (-3) = 0

- Index 4: output[4] = 1 * 0 = 0, left_product = 0 * 3 = 0

Second pass (right to left):

- right_product starts at 1

- Index 4: output[4] = 0 * 1 = 0, right_product = 1 * 0 = 0

- Index 3: output[3] = 0 * 0 = 0, right_product = 0 * (-3) = 0

- Index 2: output[2] = (-1) * 0 = 0, right_product = 0 * 0 = 0

- Index 1: output[1] = (-1) * 0 = 0, right_product = 0 * 1 = 0

- Index 0: output[0] = 1 * 0 = 0, right_product = 0 * (-1) = 0

Now, the output is [0,0,0,0,0], which doesn't match the expected [0,0,9,0,0]. So, there's definitely a mistake in this approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to separate the calculation of left and right products and not accumulate them in the output array until the end.

Let me try to compute left products and right products separately and then multiply them.

Compute left products:

- Initialize left_products = [1,1,1,1,1]

- For index 0: left_products[0] = 1 (no elements to the left)

- For index 1: left_products[1] = left_products[0] * nums[0] = 1 * (-1) = -1

- For index 2: left_products[2] = left_products[1] * nums[1] = -1 * 1 = -1

- For index 3: left_products[3] = left_products[2] * nums[2] = -1 * 0 = 0

- For index 4: left_products[4] = left_products[3] * nums[3] = 0 * (-3) = 0

Compute right products:

- Initialize right_products = [1,1,1,1,1]

- For index 4: right_products[4] = 1 (no elements to the right)

- For index 3: right_products[3] = right_products[4] * nums[4] = 1 * 3 = 3

- For index 2: right_products[2] = right_products[3] * nums[3] = 3 * (-3) = -9

- For index 1: right_products[1] = right_products[2] * nums[2] = -9 * 0 = 0

- For index 0: right_products[0] = right_products[1] * nums[1] = 0 * 1 = 0

Now, multiply left_products and right_products:

- output = [1*0, (-1)*0, (-1)*(-9), 0*3, 0*1] = [0,0,9,0,0]

This matches the expected output. So, the mistake was in accumulating the products directly in the output array without separating the left and right products.

But the follow-up requires O(1) extra space, not including the output array. So, I need to compute the left products and right products on the fly without storing them separately.

Maybe I can compute the left products and store them directly in the output array, and then compute the right products while multiplying them with the corresponding left products in the output array.

Let's try that:

Initialize output = [1,1,1,1,1]

Compute left products and store in output:

- Index 0: output[0] = 1

- Index 1: output[1] = output[0] * nums[0] = 1 * (-1) = -1

- Index 2: output[2] = output[1] * nums[1] = -1 * 1 = -1

- Index 3: output[3] = output[2] * nums[2] = -1 * 0 = 0

- Index 4: output[4] = output[3] * nums[3] = 0 * (-3) = 0

Now, output = [1, -1, -1, 0, 0]

Compute right products and multiply with output:

- Initialize right_product = 1

- Index 4: output[4] = output[4] * right_product = 0 * 1 = 0, right_product = right_product * nums[4] = 1 * 3 = 3

- Index 3: output[3] = 0 * 3 = 0, right_product = 3 * (-3) = -9

- Index 2: output[2] = (-1) * (-9) = 9, right_product = (-9) * 0 = 0

- Index 1: output[1] = (-1) * 0 = 0, right_product = 0 * 1 = 0

- Index 0: output[0] = 1 * 0 = 0, right_product = 0 * (-1) = 0

Now, output = [0,0,9,0,0], which matches the expected output.

Great, so this approach works. I need to:

1. Initialize the output array with 1s.

2. Compute the left products and store them in the output array.

3. Compute the right products, multiplying them with the corresponding elements in the output array.

This way, the output array holds the product of all elements except itself, and I'm only using O(1) extra space besides the output array.

Now, to implement this in code, I need to:

- Initialize output as a list of 1s with the same length as nums.

- Use a variable to keep track of the running product for left and right passes.

- First pass: left to right, updating output with the running product and updating the running product with the current element.

- Second pass: right to left, multiplying output with the running product and updating the running product with the current element.

Let me write a draft of this in code.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to generate an array where each element is the product of all elements in the input array except itself, without using division and in linear time complexity.

### Approach
1. **Initialize Output Array:** Start with an output array initialized to 1 for each element.
2. **Left Products:** In the first pass, traverse the array from left to right, keeping a running product of the elements to the left of each index.
3. **Right Products:** In the second pass, traverse the array from right to left, keeping a running product of the elements to the right of each index, and multiply this with the corresponding element in the output array.

This method ensures that we calculate the product of all elements except the current one in O(n) time and O(1) space (excluding the output array).

*   `1 <= k <= nums.length` Additionally, the sky was clear that day.","To solve this problem, we need to efficiently find the maximum value in each sliding window of size `k` as it moves from the left to the right of the array. A naive approach would be to iterate through each window and find the maximum in that window, but this would result in a time complexity of O(n*k), which is inefficient for large arrays.

A better approach is to use a double-ended queue (deque) to keep track of the indices of the elements in the current window in decreasing order of their values. This way, we can quickly access the maximum element in the current window by looking at the front of the deque.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create an empty deque `dq` to store indices.
   - Create an empty list `res` to store the results.

2. **Processing each element**:
   - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1` (where `n` is the length of `nums`):
     - Remove indices from the front of the deque if they are out of the current window's bounds (i.e., smaller than `i - k + 1`).
     - Remove indices from the back of the deque if the corresponding elements in `nums` are less than `nums[i]`. This ensures that the deque remains sorted in decreasing order.
     - Add the current index `i` to the back of the deque.
     - If the window has reached size `k` (i.e., `i >= k - 1`), append the maximum element of the current window (which is `nums[dq[0]]`) to the result list `res`.

3. **Return the result**:
   - Return the list `res` containing the maximum values of all sliding windows.

This approach ensures that each element is added and removed from the deque only once, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n).

Here is the Python code implementing the above approach:","python
from collections import deque

def maxSlidingWindow(nums, k):
    dq = deque()
    res = []
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Remove indices that are out of the current window
        while dq and dq[0] < i - k + 1:
            dq.popleft()
        
        # Remove indices whose corresponding values are less than nums[i]

        # Add current index to the deque

        # Append the maximum of the current window to the result list

    The algorithm is a recursive divide-and-conquer approach. It starts by iterating through the `input` string and looks for operators (+, -, *). When an operator is found, the problem is divided into two sub-problems: left and right. These sub-problems are independently solved through recursively calling the `diffWaysToCompute` function with corresponding substrings. 

Each recursion returns a list of possible results for each sub-problem. For each operator, we combine these results by iterating through both lists and performing the corresponding operation (addition, subtraction, or multiplication).

If no operators are present in the input string, a base case is reached, and the current number in the input string is returned as the only result. The recursion ultimately produces a list of all possible results for the original expression by combining results from all sub-problems.

I need to find the shortest distance between two different words in an array of strings. The array is called `wordsDict`, and the two words are `word1` and `word2`. The words are guaranteed to be different and exist in the array.

First, I need to understand what is meant by ""distance"" between two words. Since the words are in an array, I think the distance is the number of indices apart they are. For example, if `word1` is at index 2 and `word2` is at index 5, the distance would be 3.

I should consider that the words might appear multiple times in the array, and I need to find the shortest distance between any occurrences of `word1` and `word2`.

Let me look at the first example:

wordsDict = [""practice"", ""makes"", ""perfect"", ""coding"", ""makes""]

word1 = ""coding"", word2 = ""practice""

In this case, ""coding"" is at index 3 and ""practice"" is at index 0. The distance is 3 - 0 = 3.

In the second example:

wordsDict = [""practice"", ""makes"", ""perfect"", ""coding"", ""makes""]

word1 = ""makes"", word2 = ""coding""

Here, ""makes"" is at indices 1 and 4, and ""coding"" is at index 3. The distances are 3 - 1 = 2 and 4 - 3 = 1. The shortest distance is 1.

So, I need to consider all pairs of indices where one index has `word1` and the other has `word2`, and then find the minimum difference between these indices.

A brute-force approach would be to iterate through the array, find all indices of `word1` and `word2`, and then compute the differences between each pair of indices from these two lists. Finally, find the minimum difference.

But this seems inefficient, especially if the array is large, which according to the constraints, it can be up to 3 * 10^4 elements.

I need a more efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about it differently. As I iterate through the array, I can keep track of the most recent index where `word1` or `word2` appeared.

So, I'll have two variables, say `index1` and `index2`, initialized to -1.

As I iterate through the array, for each word:

- If it matches `word1`, I update `index1` to the current index.

- If it matches `word2`, I update `index2` to the current index.

- Whenever both `index1` and `index2` are not -1, I calculate the absolute difference between them and keep track of the minimum difference seen so far.

This way, I only need to traverse the array once, which is O(n), where n is the length of the array.

Let me try this approach with the first example:

wordsDict = [""practice"", ""makes"", ""perfect"", ""coding"", ""makes""]

word1 = ""coding"", word2 = ""practice""

Initialize:

index1 = -1, index2 = -1

min_distance = infinity

Iterate through the array:

Index 0: ""practice"" == ""coding""? No; ""practice"" == ""practice""? Yes -> index2 = 0

index1 = -1, index2 = 0 -> skip distance calculation

Index 1: ""makes"" == ""coding""? No; ""makes"" == ""practice""? No

No updates

Index 2: ""perfect"" == ""coding""? No; ""perfect"" == ""practice""? No

No updates

Index 3: ""coding"" == ""coding""? Yes -> index1 = 3

index1 = 3, index2 = 0 -> distance = |3 - 0| = 3

min_distance = 3

Index 4: ""makes"" == ""coding""? No; ""makes"" == ""practice""? No

No updates

Final min_distance = 3

Which matches the expected output.

Now, the second example:

wordsDict = [""practice"", ""makes"", ""perfect"", ""coding"", ""makes""]

word1 = ""makes"", word2 = ""coding""

Initialize:

index1 = -1, index2 = -1

min_distance = infinity

Iterate through the array:

Index 0: ""practice"" == ""makes""? No; ""practice"" == ""coding""? No

No updates

Index 1: ""makes"" == ""makes""? Yes -> index1 = 1

index1 = 1, index2 = -1 -> skip distance calculation

Index 2: ""perfect"" == ""makes""? No; ""perfect"" == ""coding""? No

No updates

Index 3: ""coding"" == ""makes""? No; ""coding"" == ""coding""? Yes -> index2 = 3

index1 = 1, index2 = 3 -> distance = |3 - 1| = 2

min_distance = 2

Index 4: ""makes"" == ""makes""? Yes -> index1 = 4

index1 = 4, index2 = 3 -> distance = |4 - 3| = 1

min_distance = 1

Final min_distance = 1

Which matches the expected output.

This seems to work.

I should also consider edge cases:

- The array has only two elements, one being `word1` and the other `word2`. The distance should be 1.

- The array has multiple occurrences of `word1` and `word2`, and the smallest distance is between the last occurrence of `word1` and the last occurrence of `word2`.

- `word1` and `word2` are adjacent to each other.

- The array is very large, with up to 3 * 10^4 elements.

I need to make sure that my solution is efficient and handles all these cases correctly.

Let me try another example:

wordsDict = [""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""a"", ""b"", ""c""]

word1 = ""a"", word2 = ""c""

Possible distances:

- Index 0 (a) and index 2 (c): distance 2

- Index 0 (a) and index 5 (c): distance 5

- Index 3 (a) and index 2 (c): distance 1

- Index 3 (a) and index 5 (c): distance 2

So the shortest distance is 1.

Using my approach:

Initialize:

index1 = -1, index2 = -1

min_distance = infinity

Index 0: ""a"" == ""a""? Yes -> index1 = 0

index1 = 0, index2 = -1 -> skip

Index 1: ""b"" == ""a""? No; ""b"" == ""c""? No

No updates

Index 2: ""c"" == ""a""? No; ""c"" == ""c""? Yes -> index2 = 2

index1 = 0, index2 = 2 -> distance = 2

min_distance = 2

Index 3: ""a"" == ""a""? Yes -> index1 = 3

index1 = 3, index2 = 2 -> distance = 1

min_distance = 1

Index 4: ""b"" == ""a""? No; ""b"" == ""c""? No

No updates

Index 5: ""c"" == ""a""? No; ""c"" == ""c""? Yes -> index2 = 5

index1 = 3, index2 = 5 -> distance = 2

min_distance remains 1

Correct.

Another edge case:

wordsDict = [""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d"", ""e"", ""f"", ""g""]

word1 = ""a"", word2 = ""g""

Only one occurrence each.

Distance is 6.

My approach should work here as well.

I think this approach is solid. Now, I need to implement it in Python.

I'll write a function, say `shortestDistance`, that takes `wordsDict`, `word1`, and `word2` as inputs.

Inside the function, I'll initialize `index1` and `index2` to -1, and `min_distance` to a large number (like float('inf')).

Then, iterate through the array with a for loop, keeping track of the current index and word.

Whenever I find `word1`, update `index1`, and if `index2` is not -1, calculate the distance and update `min_distance` if necessary.

Similarly, whenever I find `word2`, update `index2`, and if `index1` is not -1, calculate the distance and update `min_distance` if necessary.

After the loop, return `min_distance`.

I should also consider that `word1` and `word2` are different, as per the constraints, so I don't need to handle the case where they are the same.

Let me write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest distance between two different words, `word1` and `word2`, in an array of strings `wordsDict`. The words are guaranteed to be different and exist in the array.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Track the indices of `word1` and `word2` as we iterate through the array.
   - Use two variables, `index1` and `index2`, to store the most recent indices of `word1` and `word2` respectively.
   - Initialize `min_distance` to infinity to ensure any valid initial distance will be smaller.

2. **Iteration**:
   - Traverse the array, and for each word, check if it matches `word1` or `word2`.
   - Update the respective index variable when a match is found.
   - Whenever both indices are updated (i.e., both `word1` and `word2` have been seen at least once), calculate the absolute difference between their indices.
   - Keep track of the minimum distance found during the iteration.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - This approach ensures that we only traverse the array once, resulting in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the array.
   - This is efficient given the constraints, where the array can be up to 3 * 10^4 elements.

I need to find the shortest distance between two words in an array of strings. The words could be the same, but they have to be two different occurrences. So, in the first example, with words ""makes"" and ""coding"", the shortest distance is 1 because ""makes"" is at index 1 and ""coding"" is at index 3, which is a distance of 2 - 1 = 1. In the second example, both words are ""makes"", and the shortest distance between the two ""makes"" is 4 - 1 = 3.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking for. I have an array of strings, and two specific words. I need to find the smallest difference in indices between these two words. If the words are the same, I still need to find the smallest difference between two different indices where that word appears.

I should think about how to efficiently find these indices. One straightforward way is to iterate through the array and keep track of the indices where each word appears. Then, I can compute the differences between the indices of word1 and word2 and find the minimum difference.

Let me consider the case where word1 and word2 are different first. I'll create two lists: one for the indices where word1 appears and another for word2. Then, I can iterate through both lists to find the minimum difference between any index in word1's list and any index in word2's list.

But if word1 and word2 are the same, I need to find the minimum difference between any two distinct indices where word1 (which is the same as word2) appears. In this case, I'll have only one list of indices, and I need to find the minimum difference between any two distinct indices in that list.

I need to handle both cases in my code. I can check if word1 is equal to word2. If they are the same, I'll create one list of indices and find the minimum difference between adjacent indices. If they are different, I'll create two lists and find the minimum difference between any pair of indices from the two lists.

Let me think about the time complexity. If I have two separate lists for word1 and word2, and I iterate through both lists to find the minimum difference, it could be O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of the two lists. But I can optimize this by iterating through the array once and keeping track of the most recent indices of word1 and word2, and updating the minimum difference as I go.

Similarly, if word1 and word2 are the same, I can iterate through the array once, keeping track of the previous index where word1 was found, and calculate the difference with the current index, keeping track of the minimum difference.

I think the optimized approach would be better for large arrays, considering the constraint that wordsDict.length can be up to 10^5.

Let me outline the steps for when word1 and word2 are different:

1. Initialize two variables to keep track of the most recent indices of word1 and word2, say index1 and index2, both initially set to -1.

2. Initialize a variable min_distance to a large number, like infinity.

3. Iterate through the array from index 0 to n-1:

a. For each index i, check if wordsDict[i] is word1 or word2.

b. If wordsDict[i] is word1, update index1 to i.

c. If wordsDict[i] is word2, update index2 to i.

d. If both index1 and index2 are not -1, calculate the absolute difference between index1 and index2, and update min_distance if this difference is smaller.

4. After iterating through the array, return min_distance.

Now, for the case when word1 and word2 are the same:

1. Initialize a list to store all the indices where word1 (which is equal to word2) appears.

2. Iterate through the array and collect all indices where wordsDict[i] is word1.

3. Iterate through the list of indices and find the minimum difference between consecutive indices.

4. Return this minimum difference.

This seems straightforward. I need to make sure that I handle the case when there are multiple occurrences of the same word and find the smallest difference between any two consecutive occurrences.

Let me consider edge cases:

- The array has only two words, which are word1 and word2, and they are different. The distance should be 1.

- The array has only one word, but since word1 and word2 need to be in the array, and they are the same, the distance should be 0. Wait, but the problem says that word1 and word2 represent two individual words in the list, so the distance should be at least 1 if they are the same word.

- The array has multiple occurrences of word1 and word2, and I need to find the smallest distance among all possible pairs.

- The array is very large, so I need to make sure my solution is efficient.

I should also consider that wordsDict[i] can have lengths up to 10, but since I'm comparing strings, that shouldn't be a problem.

Let me think about the implementation in code.

For the case when word1 and word2 are different:

- I can use two variables to keep track of the most recent indices of word1 and word2.

- I update these indices as I iterate through the array.

- Whenever both indices have been set, I calculate the difference and update the minimum distance.

For the case when word1 and word2 are the same:

- I collect all indices where word1 appears.

- Then, iterate through the list of indices and find the minimum difference between consecutive indices.

I need to make sure that I handle the case when there are multiple occurrences and choose the smallest difference.

Also, I need to ensure that I'm not considering the same index twice when word1 and word2 are the same, hence the requirement to find two individual words.

Let me look back at the constraints:

- 1 <= wordsDict.length <= 10^5

- 1 <= wordsDict[i].length <= 10

- wordsDict[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

- word1 and word2 are in wordsDict.

Given the large upper limit for the array length, I need an efficient solution, preferably O(n) time complexity.

I think the approach I outlined earlier achieves this.

Let me try to write some pseudocode.

If word1!= word2:

Initialize index1 = -1, index2 = -1, min_distance = infinity

For i from 0 to n-1:

if wordsDict[i] == word1:

index1 = i

if wordsDict[i] == word2:

index2 = i

if index1!= -1 and index2!= -1:

min_distance = min(min_distance, |index1 - index2|)

Return min_distance

Else (word1 == word2):

Initialize indices = []

For i from 0 to n-1:

if wordsDict[i] == word1:

indices.append(i)

min_distance = infinity

For j from 1 to len(indices)-1:

difference = indices[j] - indices[j-1]

if difference < min_distance:

min_distance = difference

Return min_distance

This seems correct.

Let me test this logic with the first example:

wordsDict = [""practice"", ""makes"", ""perfect"", ""coding"", ""makes""]

word1 = ""makes"", word2 = ""coding""

Indices for ""makes"": 1 and 4

Indices for ""coding"": 3

The distances are |1-3| = 2 and |4-3| = 1

The minimum distance is 1, which matches the expected output.

Now, for the second example:

wordsDict = [""practice"", ""makes"", ""perfect"", ""coding"", ""makes""]

word1 = ""makes"", word2 = ""makes""

Indices for ""makes"": 1 and 4

The difference between 4 and 1 is 3, which is the expected output.

Another test case: suppose wordsDict = [""a"", ""b"", ""a"", ""b"", ""a""]

word1 = ""a"", word2 = ""b""

Indices for ""a"": 0, 2, 4

Indices for ""b"": 1, 3

Distances: |0-1|=1, |0-3|=3, |2-1|=1, |2-3|=1, |4-3|=1

Minimum distance is 1.

If word1 = ""a"", word2 = ""a""

Indices for ""a"": 0, 2, 4

Differences: 2-0=2, 4-2=2

Minimum distance is 2.

Seems correct.

Now, implement this in Python.

I need to handle the case when word1 == word2 separately.

I can check if word1 == word2, then collect all indices and find min difference between consecutive indices.

Else, keep track of the most recent indices of word1 and word2 and update the min distance.

I need to make sure that I handle the case when word1 and word2 are the same and there are multiple occurrences.

Also, need to ensure that I don't consider the same index twice.

I think the approach takes care of that.

Let me proceed to write the code accordingly.

3. **Center Check for Odd Length**: If the string has an odd length, the middle digit must be one of the digits that rotate to themselves (0, 1, 8).

    The algorithm uses a recursive approach to find all the strobogrammatic numbers of length n. It starts by checking the base cases when n is 0 or 1, and then recursively calls the helper function with n-2. This helps to build the strobogrammatic numbers by appending to the center of the existing numbers until the desired length is reached. Inside the loop, the code adds the possible pairs of strobogrammatic digits (""1"" + s + ""1"", ""6"" + s + ""9"", ""8"" + s + ""8"", ""9"" + s + ""6"") and for even lengths only, it adds 0s as well (""0"" + s + ""0""). This is because when we are building the number from the center, we cannot have leading zeros. Finally, it returns the list of strobogrammatic numbers of length n.

*   `1 <= n <= 14` John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","I've got this problem to solve: given an integer n, I need to generate all strobogrammatic numbers of length n. A strobogrammatic number is one that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees. For example, 69 and 88 are strobogrammatic because flipping them looks the same.

First, I need to understand what makes a number strobogrammatic. Certain digits look the same or become another digit when rotated 180 degrees:

- 0 rotates to 0

- 1 rotates to 1

- 6 rotates to 9

- 8 rotates to 8

- 9 rotates to 6

Digits like 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 do not have a corresponding digit they rotate into that would make the number look the same when flipped.

So, the valid digits to use in these numbers are 0, 1, 6, 8, 9, but with some constraints:

- We can't have 0 as the first digit unless n is 1, because that would make it a leading zero, which isn't allowed in numerical representations.

- For n=1, 0 is allowed.

- For n>1, the first digit can be 1, 6, 8, or 9.

Now, to generate all such numbers of length n, I need to consider the symmetry required. Since the number must look the same when rotated 180 degrees, the digits at positions symmetric across the center must correspond to each other according to the rotation rules.

For even n, it's straightforward: pairs of digits at positions (0, n-1), (1, n-2), etc., must be matching pairs as defined above.

For odd n, there's a central digit that must be rotationally symmetric by itself: 0, 1, or 8.

So, a recursive approach seems suitable here. I can build the number from the outside in, ensuring that for each pair of positions symmetric across the center, they contain matching digits.

Let me think about the base cases:

- If n=0, there are no such numbers.

- If n=1, the possible numbers are [""0"", ""1"", ""8""].

For n>1, I need to build the numbers by adding matching pairs to the ends of the solutions for n-2.

Wait, but I need to be careful with leading zeros. So, for the outermost pair, I can't use 0 unless n is 1.

So, perhaps it's better to think in terms of adding pairs to the center.

Alternatively, I can use a helper function that generates strobogrammatic numbers of a given length, and handle the even and odd cases separately.

Let me consider writing a function that generates all strobogrammatic numbers of length k, and then call it with k from 1 to n.

But actually, since the problem specifies length n, I just need to generate all such numbers of that specific length.

I should also consider the constraints on n: 1 <= n <= 14, so n can be up to 14, which means the numbers can be quite large, but since I'm just generating strings, that's manageable.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Define the pairs of digits that correspond to each other when rotated:

- (0, 0)

- (1, 1)

- (6, 9)

- (8, 8)

- (9, 6)

2. If n is even:

- Divide n by 2 to get the number of pairs.

- Generate all combinations of the pairs for the first half, and mirror them to the second half according to the rotation.

3. If n is odd:

- Divide n by 2, floor division to get the number of complete pairs.

- Add a central digit that is rotationally symmetric: 0, 1, or 8.

- Generate all combinations of the pairs for the first half, add the central digit, and mirror the first half to the second half.

But I need to make sure that if n is even and greater than 1, the first digit can't be 0.

Similarly, for odd n, the central digit can be 0, but the first digit still can't be 0.

So, perhaps it's better to handle the first and last digits separately, ensuring they are not 0 unless n=1.

Wait, no, for n=2, ""00"" would not be allowed, but ""69"" and ""88"" are fine.

Similarly, for n=3, ""000"" would not be allowed, but ""101"" and ""808"" are fine.

So, perhaps it's better to build the number recursively, adding digits to both ends in each step, ensuring that the first digit is not 0 unless n=1.

Let me consider a recursive approach:

- If n=0, return an empty string.

- If n=1, return [""0"", ""1"", ""8""].

- If n>1, generate the numbers by adding valid pairs to the ends of the solutions for n-2.

But again, need to handle leading zeros.

So, perhaps I should separate the cases where the first digit is 0 and where it's not.

Wait, but for n>1, the first digit can't be 0.

So, for n>1, the first digit can be 1, 6, 8, or 9, and the last digit must correspond to it according to the rotation.

For example:

- If the first digit is 1, the last digit must be 1.

- If the first digit is 6, the last digit must be 9.

- If the first digit is 8, the last digit must be 8.

- If the first digit is 9, the last digit must be 6.

Then, the middle part is a strobogrammatic number of length n-2.

So, I can define a recursive function that takes the length and generates the numbers accordingly.

I need to make sure that for n=2, it generates [""11"", ""69"", ""88"", ""96""], not including ""00"".

Similarly, for n=3, it should generate numbers like ""101"", ""111"", ""181"", ""609"", ""619"", ""689"", ""808"", ""818"", ""888"", ""906"", ""916"", ""986"".

Wait, but ""000"" should not be included unless n=1.

So, the recursive approach seems viable.

Let me try to formalize it:

- Define a function strobogrammatic(n):

- If n == 0:

- Return [""""]

- If n == 1:

- Return [""0"", ""1"", ""8""]

- If n > 1:

- Initialize an empty list to store the results.

- Recursively get the list for n-2.

- For each number in the list for n-2:

- For each valid pair (except possibly 0 if it's the first digit):

- Prepend the first digit of the pair and append the second digit of the pair to the number.

- Add this new number to the results list.

- Return the results list.

But I need to handle the leading zero issue.

So, perhaps I should separate the pairs that can be used for the first digit.

Define two lists:

- first_digit_pairs: pairs that can be used for the first and last digits: [(1,1), (6,9), (8,8), (9,6)]

- middle_digit_pairs: pairs that can be used for middle digits, including (0,0): [(0,0), (1,1), (6,9), (8,8), (9,6)]

Then, for n>1:

- Get the list for n-2.

- If n-2 == 0:

- Use first_digit_pairs to create the numbers.

- Else:

- For each number in the list for n-2:

- If n-2 >= 2:

- Use middle_digit_pairs to add digits around the number.

- Else:

- Use first_digit_pairs to add digits around the number.

Wait, this seems a bit convoluted.

Maybe a better way is:

- If n == 1:

- Return [""0"", ""1"", ""8""]

- If n == 2:

- Return [""11"", ""69"", ""88"", ""96""]

- If n > 2:

- Recursively get the list for n-2.

- For each number in the list for n-2:

- Add valid pairs around it, ensuring that the first digit is not 0.

- Return the collected list.

But I need to make sure that for n=3, it correctly generates numbers with a middle digit.

Wait, for n=3, n-2=1, so the middle part is a single digit from [""0"", ""1"", ""8""], and then add the outer pairs without leading zeros.

So, perhaps:

- For n > 2:

- Get the list for n-2.

- For each number in the list for n-2:

- For each valid pair (d1, d2), where d1 is not 0 if it's the first digit:

- Prepend d1 and append d2 to the number.

- Add this to the results.

Yes, that seems workable.

I need to implement this recursion carefully to handle the base cases and the leading zero constraint.

Alternatively, I can iterate from 0 to 9 for the first digit, choosing only those that can be the first digit, then choose the corresponding last digit, and recursively fill the middle.

But recursion might not be the most efficient for large n, but since n is up to 14, it should be manageable.

Another approach is to use iteration, building up the numbers layer by layer, starting from the center outward.

For example, for even n, start with an empty string, and add pairs symmetrically.

For odd n, start with the central digit and add pairs symmetrically.

This might be more efficient in terms of code simplicity.

Let me consider that.

Define a function that builds the numbers by adding digits from the center outwards.

- If n is even:

- Start with an empty string.

- Add pairs of digits symmetrically.

- Ensure that the first digit is not 0.

- If n is odd:

- Start with the central digit: 0, 1, or 8.

- Add pairs symmetrically around it.

- Ensure that the first digit is not 0.

Wait, but this is similar to the recursive approach.

Maybe I can implement it iteratively.

Let me think about the steps for n=2 and n=3.

For n=2:

- Possible pairs: 11, 69, 88, 96

For n=3:

- Central digit: 0, 1, 8

- Then add pairs around them, ensuring no leading zero.

So, for n=3 and central digit 0:

- Add pairs around ""0"": but need to ensure that the first digit is not 0.

Wait, no, for n=3, adding pairs around ""0"" would give ""101"", ""609"", ""808"", ""906"", which are fine.

Similarly, for central digit 1:

- ""111"", ""619"", ""818"", ""916""

And for central digit 8:

- ""181"", ""689"", ""888"", ""986""

So, seems manageable.

Let me try to implement this iteratively.

I can use a queue or a list to build up the numbers.

Start with the base cases:

- If n=1, start with [""0"", ""1"", ""8""]

- If n=2, start with [""11"", ""69"", ""88"", ""96""]

- For n>2, take the solutions for n-2 and add pairs around them, ensuring no leading zero.

Wait, this is similar to the recursive approach but implemented iteratively.

Perhaps I can use a loop to build up from smaller n to the desired n.

But the recursive approach might be clearer and simpler to implement.

Let me try to sketch a recursive implementation.

Define a function strobogrammatic(n):

if n == 0:

return [""""]

elif n == 1:

return [""0"", ""1"", ""8""]

else:

# Get the list for n-2

prev = strobogrammatic(n - 2)

# Define the pairs

pairs = [(""1"", ""1""), (""6"", ""9""), (""8"", ""8""), (""9"", ""6"")]

if n!= 2:

pairs.append((""0"", ""0""))

# Generate the new list

result = []

for number in prev:

for d1, d2 in pairs:

if n!= 2 and d1 == ""0"":

continue  # skip leading zero for n > 2

result.append(d1 + number + d2)

return result

Wait, but for n=2, ""00"" should not be included, right?

In the above code, for n=2, pairs include (""0"", ""0""), but since n!= 2 condition is checked before appending, it would exclude (""0"", ""0"") for n=2.

Wait, no, for n=2, n!= 2 is False, so pairs.append((""0"", ""0"")) is not executed.

Therefore, for n=2, pairs are only [(""1"", ""1""), (""6"", ""9""), (""8"", ""8""), (""9"", ""6"")], which is correct.

For n>2, it includes (""0"", ""0""), but skips it when n!= 2 and d1 == ""0"".

Wait, no, in the loop:

for d1, d2 in pairs:

if n!= 2 and d1 == ""0"":

continue

So, for n>2, it skips pairs where d1 is ""0"".

But pairs include (""0"", ""0""), so for n>2, it skips (""0"", ""0"").

But for n=3, n!= 2, so it would skip (""0"", ""0""), but we need to allow ""0"" in the middle.

Wait, no, for n=3, when adding pairs around the middle digit, the first digit can't be ""0"", but the middle digit can be ""0"".

But in this approach, for n=3, n-2=1, so prev = [""0"", ""1"", ""8""]

Then, for each number in prev, add pairs around them, skipping (""0"", ""0"") because n!= 2.

So, for ""0"", add ""101"", ""609"", ""808"", ""906""

For ""1"", add ""111"", ""619"", ""818"", ""916""

For ""8"", add ""181"", ""689"", ""888"", ""986""

So, ""0"" is allowed in the middle, which is correct.

Similarly, for n=4, n-2=2, prev = [""11"", ""69"", ""88"", ""96""]

Then, add pairs around them, skipping (""0"", ""0"")

So, add ""1111"", ""6119"", ""8118"", ""9116"", and so on.

Wait, but actually, for n=4, (""0"", ""0"") is allowed as a pair, but not as the first digit.

So, in the above code, for n=4, n!= 2, so pairs include (""0"", ""0""), but the if condition skips it when d1 == ""0"" and n!= 2.

Therefore, for n=4, it would skip (""0"", ""0""), so ""0000"" is not included, which is correct.

But actually, ""0000"" should not be included, but ""1001"", ""6009"", etc., are fine.

Wait, but in this approach, for n=4, adding (""0"", ""0"") around ""11"" would give ""0110"", but since d1 == ""0"" and n!= 2, it would be skipped.

So, only pairs (""1"", ""1""), (""6"", ""9""), (""8"", ""8""), (""9"", ""6"") are used for n=4.

Therefore, ""0110"" is not generated, which is correct.

So, this seems to work.

Let me test this logic for n=1, n=2, n=3.

n=1:

Return [""0"", ""1"", ""8""]

n=2:

Return [""11"", ""69"", ""88"", ""96""]

n=3:

prev = [""0"", ""1"", ""8""]

for number in prev:

for d1, d2 in [(""1"", ""1""), (""6"", ""9""), (""8"", ""8""), (""9"", ""6""), (""0"", ""0"")]:

if n!= 2 and d1 == ""0"":

continue

So, for ""0"":

""101"", ""609"", ""808"", ""906"", ""000"" (but ""000"" is skipped because d1 == ""0"" and n!= 2)

Similarly, for ""1"":

""111"", ""619"", ""818"", ""916"", ""010"" (skipped)

For ""8"":

""181"", ""689"", ""888"", ""986"", ""080"" (skipped)

So, it seems that ""000"" is skipped, which is correct.

But actually, ""000"" is not generated because ""0"" is in prev, and (""0"", ""0"") is skipped when n!= 2.

So, only valid numbers are generated.

This seems correct.

Therefore, I can proceed with this recursive approach.

Now, to implement this in Python, I need to handle the base cases and the recursive step as described.

I should also consider memoization to cache the results of previous computations, but since n is small (up to 14), and the recursion depth is limited, it might not be necessary.

Additionally, I need to ensure that the function returns a list of strings, not integers, to handle leading zeros correctly.

Let me write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to generate all strobogrammatic numbers of length `n`. A strobogrammatic number is one that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees. We will use a recursive approach to build these numbers.

### Approach

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If `n` is 0, return an empty list.
   - If `n` is 1, return the list `[""0"", ""1"", ""8""]` since these digits look the same when rotated individually.
   - If `n` is 2, return `[""11"", ""69"", ""88"", ""96""]` as these are the valid strobogrammatic numbers of length 2.

2. **Recursive Step**:
   - For `n` greater than 2, we recursively find the strobogrammatic numbers for `n-2`.
   - For each number obtained from the recursive call, we add valid digit pairs around it to form new strobogrammatic numbers of length `n`.
   - Valid pairs are `(1,1), (6,9), (8,8), (9,6)`, and `(0,0)` (except for the outermost digits when `n > 2` to avoid leading zeros).

3. **Avoiding Leading Zeros**:
   - For numbers with `n > 2`, we ensure that '0' is not used as the first digit by skipping pairs where `d1` is '0'.

    To solve this problem, we will use a recursive approach. 
We will create a helper function that takes two arguments m and n where m represents the remaining length of the number, and n represents the original length of the number. This helper function will return the strobogrammatic numbers of that length as a space-separated string.

In the helper function:

1. If m is 0, we return an empty string.
2. If m is 1, we return ""0 1 8"" representing the single-digit strobogrammatic numbers.
3. If n is 0, we return ""11 69 88 96"" representing the two-digit strobogrammatic numbers.

For each character `a` in the strobogrammatic numbers of length `m-2`:

1. If m is not equal to n, add a '0' in between the characters and concatenate to the result string.
2. Add '1', '6', '8', and '9' in between the characters, and concatenate to the result string.

Then, in the strobogrammaticInRange function, we iterate through the range of lengths from `low` to `high`. For each length, we check if the strobogrammatic number of that length is within the range `[low, high]`, and if it is, we increase the count by 1.

Finally, we return the total count of strobogrammatic numbers within the specified range.

I see you have a coding problem to solve, which is about finding the number of strobogrammatic numbers within a given range defined by two strings, `low` and `high`. Before we dive into the solution, let's make sure we understand what a strobogrammatic number is.

A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees. For example, the number 69 becomes 96 when rotated, which is a different number, but 88 remains the same. So, 88 is strobogrammatic, whereas 69 is not (unless considered in a pair like 69 and 96).

Given the constraints, we need to count all such numbers within the range from `low` to `high`, inclusive.

First, let's think about how to generate strobogrammatic numbers. We can observe that certain digits map to each other when rotated:

- 0 rotates to 0

- 1 rotates to 1

- 6 rotates to 9

- 8 rotates to 8

- 9 rotates to 6

So, these are the only digits we can use to form strobogrammatic numbers.

Now, the problem is to count how many such numbers fall within the given range.

One straightforward approach is to generate all strobogrammatic numbers of lengths between the lengths of `low` and `high` and count how many of them are within the range.

However, generating all possible strobogrammatic numbers and then filtering them based on the range might not be efficient, especially considering the constraints where the lengths of `low` and `high` can be up to 15 digits.

Therefore, we need a smarter way to generate only those strobogrammatic numbers that fall within the specified length range and then filter them based on the numerical value compared to `low` and `high`.

Let me outline a plan:

1. **Generate Strobogrammatic Numbers:**

- We can generate strobogrammatic numbers for each length from the length of `low` to the length of `high`.

- For each length, generate all possible combinations using the strobogrammatic pairs: (0,0), (1,1), (6,9), (8,8), (9,6).

- Handle special cases like leading zeros (except for the number 0 itself).

2. **Count Valid Numbers:**

- For each generated strobogrammatic number, check if it falls within the range [low, high].

- Count how many satisfy this condition.

But generating all possible combinations for lengths up to 15 might still be computationally expensive because the number of combinations grows exponentially with length.

To optimize, we can generate the strobogrammatic numbers in a way that we build them from the center outwards, considering the pairs that match when rotated.

Let's consider the process of building a strobogrammatic number:

- For even lengths, we can pair the digits symmetrically.

- For odd lengths, there is a central digit which must be strobogrammatic by itself (0, 1, or 8).

We can use a recursive approach to build these numbers, starting from the center and adding pairs to both ends.

Moreover, to handle the range efficiently, we need to:

- Generate numbers starting from the smallest possible length up to the largest, and within each length, generate numbers in ascending order.

- Keep track of whether the current prefix is smaller than, equal to, or larger than the corresponding part of `low` and `high`.

This way, we can prune branches that are already out of the range, reducing the number of candidates we need to consider.

Given the complexity, it might be beneficial to implement a function that generates strobogrammatic numbers up to a given length and counts those within the specified range.

Let me try to sketch a rough algorithm:

- Define the strobogrammatic pairs: (0,0), (1,1), (6,9), (8,8), (9,6).

- Implement a recursive function that builds the number from the center outwards.

- Handle the base cases for lengths 0, 1, and 2 separately if needed.

- For each length from len(low) to len(high):

- Generate all strobogrammatic numbers of that length.

- For numbers with length equal to len(low), ensure they are >= low.

- For numbers with length equal to len(high), ensure they are <= high.

- Count all valid numbers across all lengths.

Wait a minute, but implementing this recursively while keeping track of the numerical value compared to `low` and `high` might be tricky.

Alternatively, we can precompute the total number of strobogrammatic numbers for each length and then adjust based on the range.

However, this approach might not be straightforward because the numbers need to be compared against `low` and `high`, which are strings representing numbers, considering their numerical values.

Maybe a better way is to iterate through each possible length from len(low) to len(high):

- For lengths between len(low) + 1 to len(high) - 1, count all strobogrammatic numbers of that length.

- For len(low), count strobogrammatic numbers that are >= low.

- For len(high), count strobogrammatic numbers that are <= high.

This way, we can handle the edge lengths separately.

Now, how do we count strobogrammatic numbers for a given length?

We can use a recursive approach to build the number from both ends towards the center, ensuring that the chosen digits form a strobogrammatic pair.

Let's define a function that generates strobogrammatic numbers of a specific length, and while generating, it keeps track of the current number and compares it to `low` and `high` as needed.

But generating all possible numbers and then checking if they are within the range might still be inefficient for large lengths.

To optimize further, we can generate numbers in a way that we compare the current prefix with the corresponding prefix of `low` and `high`, and prune branches that are already out of range.

This is similar to how we handle problems that involve counting numbers with certain properties within a range, such as counting numbers with unique digits or counting numbers with all even digits within a range.

Given the complexity, perhaps we can look for a mathematical formula or pattern that allows us to calculate the count without generating all possible numbers.

Let's think about the number of strobogrammatic numbers for a given length.

For a number of length n:

- If n is 0, there are no numbers.

- If n is 1, the possible numbers are 0, 1, 8.

- If n is 2, the possible numbers are 11, 69, 88, 96 (but 00 is also considered, but leading zeros are not allowed except for the number 0 itself).

- For n > 2, we can build the number by adding strobogrammatic pairs to both ends, recursively.

Moreover, we need to consider that for lengths greater than 1, the first digit cannot be zero.

So, to generalize:

- Define the strobogrammatic pairs: (0,0), (1,1), (6,9), (8,8), (9,6).

- For even lengths:

- Divide the length into two halves.

- Generate all combinations for the first half, and mirror them to the second half using the strobogrammatic pairs.

- Ensure that the first digit is not zero unless the number is zero.

- For odd lengths:

- Generate the center digit as 0, 1, or 8.

- Then, generate the first half and mirror it to the second half.

But again, this doesn't directly help with counting within a range.

Perhaps a better approach is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion:

- Count the total number of strobogrammatic numbers up to `high`.

- Count the total number of strobogrammatic numbers up to `low` - 1.

- Subtract the second count from the first to get the count within the range [low, high].

This way, we can reduce the problem to counting strobogrammatic numbers up to a given number.

Now, to count strobogrammatic numbers up to a given number represented as a string, we can iterate through each possible length and count how many strobogrammatic numbers there are for that length that are less than or equal to the given number.

This involves generating strobogrammatic numbers digit by digit and comparing the current prefix with the corresponding prefix of the given number.

This approach is similar to counting numbers with unique digits or other properties within a range.

Let's try to formalize this.

Define a function `countStrobogrammaticUpTo(n: str) -> int`:

- This function will count all strobogrammatic numbers that are less than or equal to the number represented by string `n`.

- We will iterate through each digit position, choosing digits that maintain the strobogrammatic property and ensure that the current prefix is less than or equal to the corresponding prefix of `n`.

This function can be implemented using recursion or iteration, keeping track of the current prefix and whether it is still within the range.

Once we have this function, the main function can be implemented as:

- Count the number of strobogrammatic numbers up to `high`.

- Count the number of strobogrammatic numbers up to `str(int(low) - 1)`.

- Subtract the second count from the first to get the count within [low, high].

We need to handle the case where `low` is ""0"", since ""0"" is a valid strobogrammatic number.

Also, need to ensure that numbers with leading zeros are only considered if they are the number zero.

This seems like a solid plan. Now, let's think about how to implement the `countStrobogrammaticUpTo(n: str) -> int` function.

We can iterate through each digit position, keeping track of:

- The current position `i`.

- The current prefix formed so far.

- Whether the current prefix is equal to the corresponding part of `n` (to decide whether we can choose digits freely or need to respect the upper limit).

- Whether the number has leading zeros.

At each step, we choose a digit that:

- Forms a strobogrammatic pair with the digit that would be at the opposite end.

- Respects the upper limit if the prefix is equal to the corresponding part of `n`.

- Does not add leading zeros unless the number is zero.

This is getting a bit complicated, but it's necessary to handle large inputs efficiently.

Let me try to outline the steps in more detail:

1. **Initialize:**

- Define the strobogrammatic pairs: (0,0), (1,1), (6,9), (8,8), (9,6).

- Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of valid strobogrammatic numbers.

2. **Handle special cases:**

- If `n` is ""0"", handle it separately since it's a strobogrammatic number.

- If the length of `n` is 1, handle it separately.

3. **Iterate through each possible length:**

- For each length from 1 to the length of `n`:

- If the length is less than the length of `n`, count all strobogrammatic numbers of that length.

- If the length is equal to the length of `n`, count strobogrammatic numbers that are less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Count strobogrammatic numbers for a given length:**

- Use a recursive helper function that builds the number from left to right, ensuring that:

- The chosen digits form strobogrammatic pairs.

- The number does not have leading zeros, except for the number zero.

- The number is less than or equal to `n` if the length is equal to `n`'s length.

This helper function can take parameters like the current position, the prefix formed so far, and a flag indicating whether the current prefix is still less than `n`.

This seems manageable, but implementing it correctly will require careful handling of the constraints.

Let me try to write a rough draft of the `countStrobogrammaticUpTo` function.

Define `countStrobogrammaticUpTo(n: str) -> int`:

- Initialize count = 0

- Define the strobogrammatic pairs: [(0,0), (1,1), (6,9), (8,8), (9,6)]

- For length l from 1 to len(n):

- If l < len(n):

- Count all strobogrammatic numbers of length l

- Else:

- Recursively build the number from left to right, choosing digits that maintain the strobogrammatic property and ensure the number is <= n.

- Adjust the count based on whether the number is less than or equal to n.

This is a high-level description, and the actual implementation will require more details.

Now, to count all strobogrammatic numbers of a given length, we can use the following approach:

- If the length is 0, return 0.

- If the length is 1, return 3 (0, 1, 8).

- If the length is 2, return 4 (11, 69, 88, 96), but exclude 00 if leading zeros are not allowed.

- For longer lengths, use the pairs to build the number from the center outwards or from both ends towards the center.

But in our case, since we are dealing with variable lengths and needing to compare with `n`, it's better to have a unified approach using recursion or iteration to build the numbers digit by digit.

Let's consider implementing the helper function recursively.

Define a helper function `helper(low, high, n, is_less, prefix, suffix)` where:

- `low` and `high` are the original parameters.

- `n` is the current length being considered.

- `is_less` is a boolean indicating whether the current prefix is less than the corresponding part of `high`.

- `prefix` is the current prefix built so far.

- `suffix` is the current suffix built so far.

Wait, perhaps I need to rethink this.

A better approach might be to have a helper function that, given the current position and the prefix, decides what digits can be chosen next.

But managing both the prefix and the suffix simultaneously might be too complicated.

An alternative idea is to generate the first half of the number and then mirror it to create the second half, based on the strobogrammatic pairs.

For example, for even lengths:

- Divide the length by 2.

- Generate all possible combinations for the first half.

- Mirror it to create the second half.

For odd lengths:

- Choose the center digit as 0, 1, or 8.

- Generate the first half and mirror it to the second half.

This way, we can generate the entire number and then check if it's within the range.

However, this approach doesn't handle the range efficiently, as we may generate numbers that are out of the range.

To optimize, we need a way to generate numbers in order and stop once we exceed the range.

Given the time constraints, perhaps implementing the inclusion-exclusion principle as described earlier is the way to go.

Let's proceed with that plan.

Implement the `countStrobogrammaticUpTo(n: str) -> int` function.

In this function:

- Initialize a variable `count` to 0.

- For each length `l` from 1 to `len(n)`:

- If `l` < `len(n)`:

- Add the count of all strobogrammatic numbers of length `l`.

- Else if `l` == `len(n)`:

- Recursively build the number digit by digit, ensuring it's less than or equal to `n`, and count the valid strobogrammatic numbers.

To count all strobogrammatic numbers of a given length `l`, we can use the following formula:

- For `l` == 1: 3 (0, 1, 8)

- For `l` == 2: 4 (11, 69, 88, 96), but exclude 00 if leading zeros are not allowed.

- For `l` > 2: 5^(floor(l/2)) * c, where c is 3 if l is odd, else 1.

But we need to adjust for leading zeros and the upper limit imposed by `n`.

This formula might not be directly applicable due to the constraints, so perhaps it's better to implement a recursive function that builds the number digit by digit, keeping track of whether it's forming a number less than, equal to, or greater than `n`.

Let's try to implement the `countStrobogrammaticUpTo(n: str) -> int` function step by step.

Define the strobogrammatic pairs:

`pairs = [(0,0), (1,1), (6,9), (8,8), (9,6)]`

Implement the function:

def countStrobogrammaticUpTo(n: str) -> int:

count = 0

for length in range(1, len(n) + 1):

if length < len(n):

count += countStrobogrammatic(length)

else:

count += countStrobogrammaticWithPrefix(n, length)

return count

Here, `countStrobogrammatic(length)` counts all strobogrammatic numbers of a given length, and `countStrobogrammaticWithPrefix(n, length)` counts strobogrammatic numbers of length `len(n)` that are less than or equal to `n`.

Now, implement `countStrobogrammatic(length)`:

def countStrobogrammatic(length: int) -> int:

if length == 0:

return 0

if length == 1:

return 3  # 0, 1, 8

if length == 2:

return 4  # 11, 69, 88, 96

# For length > 2

# First digit can be 1,6,8,9 (cannot be 0)

# Last digit is determined by the first digit

# Middle digits can be 0,1,6,8,9

count = 4 * (5 ** (length // 2 - 1)) if length % 2 == 0 else 4 * (5 ** (length // 2)) * 3

return count

Wait, but this formula might not be accurate for all lengths, especially considering the constraints of strobogrammatic pairs and leading zeros.

Perhaps it's better to implement a recursive function that builds the number digit by digit, ensuring the strobogrammatic property.

Let's try to implement `countStrobogrammaticWithPrefix(n, length)`.

Define a helper function that recursively builds the number:

def countStrobogrammaticWithPrefix(n: str, length: int) -> int:

def helper(index: int, is_less: bool, prefix: str, suffix: str) -> int:

if index == length // 2:

if length % 2 == 0:

if not is_less and prefix + suffix > n:

return 0

return 1

else:

# Odd length, handle center digit

center_digit = int(n[length // 2])

count = 0

for digit in [0,1,8]:

if digit < center_digit or (digit == center_digit and is_less):

count += 1

elif digit == center_digit:

count += helper(index + 1, is_less and digit < center_digit, prefix + str(digit), str(digit) + suffix)

return count

# Start recursion

return helper(0, False, """", """")

This is a rough attempt, and it might need adjustments.

Overall, implementing this function correctly requires careful management of the digits chosen at each position and how they affect the comparison with `n`.

Given the complexity, it's clear that this problem is non-trivial and requires a thoughtful implementation.

To summarize, the plan is:

1. Implement a function to count all strobogrammatic numbers up to a given length.

2. Implement a function to count strobogrammatic numbers up to a specific number represented as a string.

3. Use these functions to calculate the count within the range [low, high].

Now, considering the time constraints, perhaps there are precomputed values or patterns we can exploit to simplify the process.

Alternatively, since the lengths can be up to 15 digits, and considering that the count of strobogrammatic numbers grows exponentially with length, we need an efficient way to compute the counts without iterating through all possible numbers.

Let me try to find a pattern or formula for the count of strobogrammatic numbers of a given length.

For length 1: 3 (0,1,8)

For length 2: 4 (11,69,88,96)

For length 3: 12 (e.g., 101,609,808,906,111,619,818,916,181,689,888,986)

For length 4: 17 (1001,6009,8008,9006,1111,6119,8118,9116,1691,6699,8698,9696,1881,6889,8888,9886,1961,6969,8968,9966)

Wait, but counting manually is error-prone and time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use dynamic programming to build up the count for each length.

Define an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the count of strobogrammatic numbers of length `i`.

We can define the transitions based on the possible pairs.

For example:

- dp[0] = 0

- dp[1] = 3

- dp[2] = 4

- For dp[i], where i > 2:

- dp[i] = dp[i-2] * 5 (since there are 5 possible pairs for each position, but need to adjust for leading zeros)

But again, this formula might not be entirely accurate because it doesn't account for leading zeros and the specific constraints of the pairs.

Given this uncertainty, perhaps it's better to proceed with the initial plan of implementing a recursive function that builds the number digit by digit, keeping track of the strobogrammatic property and the comparison with `n`.

To make this more concrete, let's consider an example.

Suppose n = ""100""

We need to count strobogrammatic numbers up to 100.

Lengths to consider: 1 and 2 and 3.

- For length 1: 0,1,8 (but 0 is only considered if n >= ""0"")

- For length 2: 11,69,88,96

- For length 3: numbers like 101,609,808,906, etc., but only those <= ""100""

For length 3, only 101 is <= ""100"", but 101 > 100, so no numbers.

Wait, 101 is greater than 100, so no strobogrammatic numbers of length 3 are <= ""100"".

Therefore, total count is 3 (from length 1) + 4 (from length 2) + 0 (from length 3) = 7.

But in the example given, the output is 3 for low = ""50"", high = ""100"". Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, in the example, low = ""50"", high = ""100"", and the output is 3.

So, we need to count strobogrammatic numbers between 50 and 100, inclusive.

From the counts above, between 50 and 100:

- From length 2: 69,88,96 (11 is 11, which is less than 50)

- From length 3: 101 is greater than 100, so none.

So, only 69,88,96 are in the range [50,100], which matches the example output of 3.

Therefore, to count within a range, we need to:

- Count strobogrammatic numbers up to high.

- Count strobogrammatic numbers up to low - 1.

- Subtract the second count from the first.

In this case:

- countUpTo(100) = 7 (0,1,8,11,69,88,96)

- countUpTo(49) = 4 (0,1,8,11)

- So, count between 50 and 100 is 7 - 4 = 3, which matches the example.

Therefore, this approach seems correct.

Now, to implement `countUpTo(n)`, we need to handle the digit-by-digit comparison carefully.

Let's try to implement `countUpTo(n)` recursively.

Define a recursive function that, at each step, chooses a digit that maintains the strobogrammatic property and ensures that the number being built is less than or equal to n.

Here's a possible implementation:

def countUpTo(n: str) -> int:

def isStrobogrammatic(s: str) -> bool:

lookup = {'0':'0','1':'1','6':'9','8':'8','9':'6'}

return all(s[i] == lookup.get(s[~i], '') for i in range(len(s)//2 + 1))

count = 0

for length in range(1, len(n)+1):

if length < len(n):

# Count all strobogrammatic numbers of this length

count += countStrobogrammatic(length)

else:

# Count strobogrammatic numbers of this length <= n

for num in generateStrobogrammatic(length):

if num <= n:

count += 1

return count

But this is not efficient for large n, as generating all strobogrammatic numbers of length len(n) is time-consuming.

Instead, we need a way to generate strobogrammatic numbers up to n without generating all of them.

Let's try to implement a helper function that builds the number digit by digit, keeping track of whether the current prefix is less than, equal to, or greater than the corresponding part of n.

Define a recursive function `helper` that takes the current position, the current prefix, and whether the current prefix is less than n.

def countUpTo(n: str) -> int:

def helper(index: int, is_less: bool, prefix: str) -> int:

if index == len(n):

if is_less or (not is_less and prefix == n):

return 1

return 0

count = 0

for digit, opposite in pairs:

if index == 0 and digit == 0 and len(n) > 1:

continue  # Skip leading zeros unless the number is zero

if index >= len(n) - index - 1:

if digit == opposite or (digit!= opposite and index < len(n) - index - 1):

new_is_less = is_less or (digit < int(n[index]))

new_prefix = prefix + str(digit)

if len(new_prefix) == len(n):

count += helper(index + 1, new_is_less, new_prefix)

else:

# Continue building the number

count += helper(index + 1, new_is_less, new_prefix)

return count

# Handle the number 0 separately

if n == ""0"":

return 1

return helper(0, False, """")

This is a rough sketch and likely contains errors, but it outlines the general approach.

Implementing this correctly requires careful handling of the digits, the strobogrammatic pairs, and the comparison with n.

Given the complexity, it's advisable to test the function with small values first and gradually increase the test cases to ensure correctness.

Once `countUpTo` is implemented correctly, the main function can be written as:

def strobogrammaticInRange(low: str, high: str) -> int:

low_int = int(low)

high_int = int(high)

if low_int > high_int:

return 0

# Handle low = ""0"" and high = ""0"" case

if low_int == 0 and high_int == 0:

return 1

# Count strobogrammatic numbers up to high

count_high = countUpTo(str(high_int))

# Count strobogrammatic numbers up to low - 1

count_low_minus_one = countUpTo(str(low_int - 1))

# The count in the range [low, high] is count_high - count_low_minus_one

return count_high - count_low_minus_one

This should give the correct count of strobogrammatic numbers within the range [low, high].

However, due to the complexity of implementing `countUpTo`, it's crucial to ensure its correctness through thorough testing.

Alternative Approaches:

1. **Generate and Check:** Generate all strobogrammatic numbers within the possible length range and check if they fall within [low, high]. This approach is straightforward but may not be efficient for large ranges due to the exponential number of candidates.

2. **Mathematical Formula:** Derive a formula to calculate the count of strobogrammatic numbers for each length and adjust based on the range limits. This requires a deep understanding of the patterns in strobogrammatic numbers and might be error-prone.

3. **Digit Dynamic Programming:** Use a digit DP approach to count the numbers without generating them, keeping track of the strobogrammatic property and the range constraints. This is similar to the chosen approach but might require a different implementation.

Given the constraints and the need for efficiency, the chosen approach of counting strobogrammatic numbers up to a given limit and then using inclusion-exclusion seems appropriate.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to count the number of strobogrammatic numbers within a given range `[low, high]`. A strobogrammatic number is one that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Strobogrammatic Numbers**:
   - Certain digits map to each other when rotated: 0 to 0, 1 to 1, 6 to 9, 8 to 8, and 9 to 6.
   - We need to generate numbers using these mappings and count those within the specified range.

2. **Counting Strobogrammatic Numbers**:
   - We will implement a function `countStrobogrammaticUpTo(n: str) -> int` to count strobogrammatic numbers up to a given number `n`.
   - Use a recursive helper function to build the number digit by digit, ensuring the strobogrammatic property and comparing with `n` to stay within limits.

3. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**:
   - Count the strobogrammatic numbers up to `high`.
   - Count the strobogrammatic numbers up to `low - 1`.
   - The difference between these counts will give the count of strobogrammatic numbers within the range `[low, high]`.

    The idea is to create a unique key for each group of strings, that depends on the relative distances between characters in a string. We iterate through the given strings and create the key for each string by taking the difference between the ASCII code of each character and that of the first character, modulo 26. We add these deltas as comma-separated elements and use them as the key in a map. Where a map is a hashmap in C++ and Java, defaultdict in Python, and Map in JavaScript. For each string, we append it to the list of strings corresponding to its group (key) in the map.

After iterating through all the strings, we return the list of groups from the map.

Note that the modulo operation and `<code>26</code>` come from the number of lowercase English letters which is 26. So, any shift greater than 25 will simply wrap around to the initial letters.

For example, ""abc"" can be shifted to ""bcd"", and so on. I need to group all such strings that belong to the same shifting sequence.

First, I need to understand what it means for two strings to be in the same shifting sequence. Shifting a string means moving each letter by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. So, ""abc"" shifted by 1 becomes ""bcd"", shifted by 2 becomes ""cde"", and so on. Similarly, ""xyz"" shifted by 1 is ""yza"", but since we only have lowercase letters, ""z"" shifted by 1 becomes ""a"".

So, the key here is that the relative distances between the letters in the string should be the same for strings in the same group. For example, in ""abc"", the distances between 'a' and 'b', 'b' and 'c' are both 1. Similarly, in ""bcd"", it's also 1, and in ""xyz"", it's also 1. So, they belong to the same group.

On the other hand, ""acef"" has distances 2 and 3 between letters, so it's a different group. ""az"" has a distance of 25 (from 'a' to 'z'), and ""ba"" has a distance of 25 as well (from 'b' to 'a', wrapping around), so they are in the same group.

Single-letter strings like ""a"" and ""z"" are a bit tricky. Since there are no distances between letters, they might be considered in their own group, but looking at the example, ""a"" and ""z"" are in the same group. Maybe because the shift from 'a' to 'z' is a specific shift value.

So, to solve this, I need a way to represent each string by its shift pattern, and then group strings that have the same pattern.

One way to do this is to calculate the differences between consecutive letters in the string, and use those differences as a key for grouping.

But, I need to handle the wrapping around from 'z' to 'a'. Since the alphabet is cyclic, shifting 'z' by 1 gives 'a'. So, the differences should be calculated modulo 26.

Let me think about how to calculate these differences.

Each letter can be represented by its position in the alphabet, 'a' being 0, 'b' being 1, up to 'z' being 25.

For a string like ""abc"", the positions are [0,1,2]. The differences are [1,1], since 1-0=1 and 2-1=1.

For ""bcd"", it's [1,2,3], differences [1,1].

For ""xyz"", it's [23,24,25], differences [1,1].

For ""acef"", it's [0,2,4,5], differences [2,2,1].

For ""az"", it's [0,25], difference [25].

For ""ba"", it's [1,0], difference [25], since 0 - 1 = -1, but modulo 26 is 25.

For single-letter strings ""a"" and ""z"", since there are no differences, I need a way to group them together. Maybe I can consider their length as part of the key, so single-letter strings are grouped together.

Wait, in the example, ""a"" and ""z"" are in the same group, but they are both single-letter strings. So, perhaps single-letter strings are grouped based on their own value, but in this case, ""a"" and ""z"" are in the same group. Maybe because shifting ""a"" by 25 gives ""z"".

Hmm.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says we can shift a string by shifting each of its letters to its successive letter, like ""abc"" to ""bcd"". So, for single-letter strings, shifting ""a"" gives ""b"", shifting again gives ""c"", and so on, up to ""z"", then ""a"" again.

So, for single-letter strings, they can be shifted into each other by a certain number of shifts. So, all single-letter strings belong to the same group.

Wait, but in the example, ""a"" and ""z"" are in the same group, but ""a"" shifted by 25 is ""z"". So, they are considered in the same group.

But, according to the problem statement, we can shift a string by shifting each of its letters to its successive letter. So, for single-letter strings, shifting ""a"" gives ""b"", shifting ""b"" gives ""c"", and so on, up to ""z"", and then shifting ""z"" gives ""a"" again.

So, in this sense, all single-letter strings can be shifted into each other by a certain number of shifts. So, they belong to the same group.

Therefore, all single-letter strings should be in one group.

But in the example, ""a"" and ""z"" are in the same group, but not combined with other groups. So, I need to make sure that single-letter strings are grouped together.

Ok, so my plan is:

- For strings with length greater than 1, calculate the differences between consecutive letters, modulo 26, and use that as a key.

- For single-letter strings, group them all together, since they can be shifted into each other by shifting all their letters the same amount.

Wait, but in the example, ""a"" and ""z"" are in the same group, but other single-letter strings are not present. So, perhaps all single-letter strings are in one group.

But, to confirm, let's look at the constraints: strings consist of lowercase English letters, and length is at least 1.

So, in the example, strings = [""abc"",""bcd"",""acef"",""xyz"",""az"",""ba"",""a"",""z""]

So, groupings are:

- [""acef""]

- [""a"",""z""]

- [""abc"",""bcd"",""xyz""]

- [""az"",""ba""]

So, ""a"" and ""z"" are grouped together, and other single-letter strings would be grouped with them.

Wait, but in this example, ""a"" and ""z"" are the only single-letter strings. If there were more single-letter strings, say ""b"", ""c"", etc., would they be in the same group as ""a"" and ""z""? Based on the shifting rule, yes, because you can shift ""a"" to ""b"", ""b"" to ""c"", and so on.

But in the example, ""a"" and ""z"" are in one group, and other groups have strings with more than one letter.

Wait, perhaps for single-letter strings, since they can be shifted into each other by shifting each letter (which is the only letter) by a certain amount, they are all in one group.

But, in the output, they are only grouping ""a"" and ""z"" together, not including other possible single-letter strings.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe for single-letter strings, since there's no difference to calculate, I can use the letter itself as the key, but in the example, ""a"" and ""z"" are in the same group, which suggests that single-letter strings are grouped based on their value modulo something.

Wait, ""a"" is 'a', and ""z"" is 'z', which is 25 positions away from 'a'. So, shifting ""a"" by 25 gives ""z"". So, perhaps single-letter strings are grouped based on their value, and since ""a"" and ""z"" are in the same group, maybe all single-letter strings are in one group.

But, in the example, they are only grouping ""a"" and ""z"" together, not including other possible single-letter strings.

Wait, perhaps the grouping is based on the fact that single-letter strings can be shifted into each other by shifting each letter by a certain amount.

So, all single-letter strings belong to one group.

But in the output, they are only showing ""a"" and ""z"" in one group.

Wait, perhaps I need to confirm the grouping rule more carefully.

Looking back at the problem statement: ""Group all strings[i] that belong to the same shifting sequence.""

So, for single-letter strings, since there's only one letter, shifting that single letter by a certain amount will map to another single-letter string.

So, all single-letter strings can be obtained by shifting any one of them by a certain number of positions.

Therefore, all single-letter strings should be in one group.

But in the example, they are only showing ""a"" and ""z"" in one group. Maybe because those are the only single-letter strings present in the input.

So, in the input, there are only ""a"" and ""z"" as single-letter strings, so they are grouped together, and other groups have strings with more than one letter.

So, in general, all single-letter strings should be in one group.

Ok, now, how to implement this.

I need to group strings based on their shift pattern.

For strings with length greater than 1, I can compute the differences between consecutive letters, modulo 26, and use that as a key.

For single-letter strings, I can use a special key, say'single', and group them all together.

But in the example, ""a"" and ""z"" are in one group, which makes sense because they are single-letter strings.

Ok, so my plan is:

- For strings with length > 1, compute the differences between consecutive letters, modulo 26, and use that tuple as a key.

- For single-letter strings, use a special key, say'single', and group them all together.

But, in the example, ""a"" and ""z"" are in one group, but if there were more single-letter strings, say ""b"", ""c"", etc., they would also be in that group.

But in the output, only ""a"" and ""z"" are present, probably because they are the only single-letter strings in the input.

Ok, so I need to implement this logic.

Also, I need to make sure that the differences are calculated correctly, taking into account the wrapping around from 'z' to 'a'.

Let me think about how to calculate the differences.

Each letter can be represented by its position in the alphabet, 'a' being 0, 'b' being 1,..., 'z' being 25.

For two consecutive letters, say 'a' and 'b', their positions are 0 and 1, so the difference is 1.

If it's 'z' and 'a', positions 25 and 0, difference is (0 - 25) mod 26 = 1.

Wait, but in Python, negative numbers modulo is also handled correctly, so 0 - 25 = -25, and -25 mod 26 is 1.

So, in Python, I can calculate the difference as (ord(b) - ord(a)) % 26, where a and b are consecutive letters.

So, I can iterate through the string, calculate these differences, and store them as a tuple, which can be used as a key in a dictionary to group the strings.

For single-letter strings, I'll use a special key, say'single'.

Then, after grouping, I can return the values of the dictionary as lists of strings.

Let me try to write some pseudocode.

First, create a dictionary to hold the groups.

Then, iterate through each string in the input list:

- If the string has length 1, add it to the'single' group.

- Else, calculate the differences between consecutive letters, modulo 26, and use that tuple as a key to add the string to the corresponding group.

Finally, collect all the groups and return them as a list of lists.

Let me try to implement this in code.

First, I need a way to calculate the differences.

Define a function that takes a string and returns the difference tuple.

Something like:

def get_diff_key(s):

differences = []

for i in range(1, len(s)):

a = ord(s[i-1]) - ord('a')

b = ord(s[i]) - ord('a')

diff = (b - a) % 26

differences.append(diff)

return tuple(differences)

Then, in the main function:

group_dict = {}

for s in strings:

if len(s) == 1:

key ='single'

else:

key = get_diff_key(s)

if key in group_dict:

group_dict[key].append(s)

else:

group_dict[key] = [s]

# Then, collect the groups

return list(group_dict.values())

But, in the example, ""a"" and ""z"" are in one group, which is consistent with this approach.

Wait, but in this approach, all single-letter strings are grouped together.

But in the example, only ""a"" and ""z"" are present as single-letter strings, so they are in one group.

If there were more single-letter strings, say ""b"", ""c"", etc., they would also be in that group.

But, is this the correct approach?

Wait, perhaps I need to group single-letter strings based on their own value, since shifting ""a"" gives ""b"", which is a different single-letter string.

But, in the problem statement, it says to group strings that can be shifted into each other by shifting each letter.

For single-letter strings, shifting ""a"" gives ""b"", shifting ""b"" gives ""c"", and so on, so all single-letter strings can be shifted into each other by a series of shifts.

So, perhaps they should all be in one group.

But, in the example, only ""a"" and ""z"" are present as single-letter strings, so they are in one group.

Ok, so my approach seems correct.

Let me test it with the first example.

strings = [""abc"",""bcd"",""acef"",""xyz"",""az"",""ba"",""a"",""z""]

- ""abc"": differences [1,1]

- ""bcd"": differences [1,1]

- ""acef"": differences [2,2,1]

- ""xyz"": differences [1,1]

- ""az"": differences [25]

- ""ba"": differences [25]

- ""a"": single

- ""z"": single

So, groups:

- (1,1): [""abc"",""bcd"",""xyz""]

- (2,2,1): [""acef""]

- (25,): [""az"",""ba""]

-'single': [""a"",""z""]

Which matches the example output.

Great.

Now, for the second example:

strings = [""a""]

- ""a"": single

So, groups:

-'single': [""a""]

Which matches the output.

Good.

I think this approach is correct.

Now, I need to implement this in Python.

I need to make sure that the difference calculation handles the wrapping around correctly.

Also, I need to handle strings of different lengths properly.

Edge cases to consider:

- All single-letter strings.

- Strings with repeated letters, like ""aaa"", ""bbb"".

- Strings with wrapping around, like ""za"", which should be treated carefully.

Wait, ""za"": 'z' to 'a' is a difference of 1, as (0 - 25) % 26 = 1.

So, differences [1].

- ""za"": [1]

- ""ab"": [1]

So, they should be in the same group, because both have difference [1].

Another example: ""aa"": [0], since 'a' to 'a' is difference 0.

Similarly, ""bb"": [0]

So, ""aa"" and ""bb"" should be in the same group, because their difference is [0].

Wait, but according to the problem constraints, strings consist of lowercase English letters, and lengths from 1 to 50.

So, in this case, my approach should work.

I need to make sure that the difference calculation is correct.

Also, for single-letter strings, they are all grouped together.

Ok, I think I'm ready to write the code.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to group strings that can be transformed into each other by shifting their letters uniformly. For example, ""abc"" can be shifted to ""bcd"" by shifting each letter by one position.

### Approach
1. **Shifting Pattern Identification**: The relative distances between consecutive letters in the strings determine their shifting sequence. By calculating these differences, we can group strings that follow the same pattern.
2. **Handling Single-Letter Strings**: Single-letter strings can be considered to have the same pattern, as they can be shifted into each other by moving through the alphabet cycle.

2. We recursively call the helper function for the left and right nodes of the current node.

            self.row += 1
            self.col = 0
        return False
```

    
    The algorithm is quite straightforward. We track the indices `row` and `col` for traversal. In C++ and Java implementations, iterators are used for the same purpose.

1. In the constructor, we initialize the 2D vector and set the initial row and columns to zero.

2. In the `next()` function, we return the value corresponding to the indices (or iterators) and increment the column (or iterator) by 1.

3. In the `hasNext()` function, we check if we have a valid element and if not, we try to move forward to the next row (or iterator) and reset the column (or iterator) to 0. This process continues until we find a valid element, or we reach the end of the 2D vector. If a valid element is found, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
    ","Design an iterator to flatten a 2D vector. It should support the `next` and `hasNext` operations.

Implement the `Vector2D` class:

*   `Vector2D(int[][] vec)` initializes the object with the 2D vector `vec`.
*   `next()` returns the next element from the 2D vector and moves the pointer one step forward. You may assume that all the calls to `next` are valid.
*   `hasNext()` returns `true` if there are still some elements in the vector, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ ""Vector2D "",  ""next "",  ""next "",  ""next "",  ""hasNext "",  ""hasNext "",  ""next "",  ""hasNext ""\]
\[\[\[\[1, 2\], \[3\], \[4\]\]\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, 1, 2, 3, true, true, 4, false\]

**Explanation**
Vector2D vector2D = new Vector2D(\[\[1, 2\], \[3\], \[4\]\]);
vector2D.next();    // return 1
vector2D.next();    // return 2
vector2D.next();    // return 3
vector2D.hasNext(); // return True
vector2D.hasNext(); // return True
vector2D.next();    // return 4
vector2D.hasNext(); // return False

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= vec.length <= 200`
*   `0 <= vec[i].length <= 500`
*   `-500 <= vec[i][j] <= 500`
*   At most `105` calls will be made to `next` and `hasNext`.

**Follow up:** As an added challenge, try to code it using only [iterators in C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/iterator/) or [iterators in Java](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html). Additionally, the sky was clear that day.","Alright, I need to design an iterator that can flatten a 2D vector and support `next` and `hasNext` operations. The vector is given as an array of arrays, and I have to handle cases where some subarrays might be empty.

First, I need to think about how to structure this class. I'll call it `Vector2D`, and it should be initialized with the 2D vector. Then, it should have methods `next()` and `hasNext()`.

One approach is to flatten the entire 2D vector into a single list during initialization. That way, `next()` and `hasNext()` operations would be straightforward, similar to iterating over a 1D list.

However, flattening the entire vector might not be efficient if the vector is very large, especially since the problem mentions that there can be up to 10^5 calls to `next` and `hasNext`. So, I should consider an approach that doesn't require upfront flattening of the entire structure.

An alternative is to maintain two pointers: one for the current row and one for the current column within that row. Here's how it could work:

- Initialize `row` to 0 and `col` to 0.

- In `next()`, return the element at `vec[row][col]` and increment `col`.

- In `hasNext()`, check if there are more elements in the current row beyond `col`. If not, move to the next row that has elements and set `col` to 0 for that row.

I need to handle cases where subarrays might be empty. So, in `hasNext()`, I might need to skip over empty subarrays.

Let me try to outline the steps for `hasNext()`:

1. If the current `row` is within bounds and `col` is less than the length of `vec[row]`, return True.

2. If not, increment `row` and set `col` to 0, checking if `row` is still within bounds.

3. Repeat until a row with elements is found or all rows are exhausted.

Similarly, for `next()`:

1. If `hasNext()` is True, return `vec[row][col]` and increment `col`.

2. If `hasNext()` is False, perhaps raise an exception or handle it appropriately, as per the problem's assumption that all calls to `next` are valid.

I should also consider the initialization part. If the input vector is empty, then `hasNext()` should always return False, and `next()` should not be called (as per the problem's assumption).

Let me think about an example:

Input: [[1,2], [3], [4]]

- Initialize: row=0, col=0

- next(): return vec[0][0] = 1, col=1

- next(): return vec[0][1] = 2, col=2

- hasNext(): row=0, col=2 >= len(vec[0])=2, so move to row=1, col=0

- hasNext(): row=1, col=0 < len(vec[1])=1, return True

- next(): return vec[1][0] = 3, col=1

- hasNext(): row=1, col=1 >= len(vec[1])=1, move to row=2, col=0

- hasNext(): row=2, col=0 < len(vec[2])=1, return True

- next(): return vec[2][0] = 4, col=1

- hasNext(): row=2, col=1 >= len(vec[2])=1, move to row=3, which is out of bounds, so return False

This seems correct.

Now, let's consider an empty vector: []

- Initialize: row=0, but vec has length 0

- hasNext(): row=0 is out of bounds, so return False

- next() should not be called, but per the problem, we can assume it's only called when hasNext() is True.

Another case: [[], [3,4], [], [5]]

- Initialize: row=0, col=0

- hasNext(): row=0, col=0, but vec[0] is empty, so move to row=1

- hasNext(): row=1, col=0 < len(vec[1])=2, return True

- next(): return vec[1][0] = 3, col=1

- next(): return vec[1][1] = 4, col=2

- hasNext(): row=1, col=2 >= len(vec[1])=2, move to row=2

- hasNext(): row=2, col=0, but vec[2] is empty, move to row=3

- hasNext(): row=3, col=0 < len(vec[3])=1, return True

- next(): return vec[3][0] = 5, col=1

- hasNext(): row=3, col=1 >= len(vec[3])=1, move to row=4, out of bounds, return False

Good.

I need to make sure that I handle empty subarrays and that I don't go out of bounds.

In terms of implementation, I'll store the input vector, and initialize row and col to 0.

In `hasNext()`, I'll implement the logic to find the next valid element.

In `next()`, I'll return the current element and move to the next column.

I should also consider the possibility of the vector being empty or having only empty subarrays.

Let me try to write some pseudocode:

class Vector2D:

def \_\_init\_\_(self, vec: List[List[int]]):

self.vec = vec

self.row = 0

self.col = 0

def advance_to_next(self):

while self.row < len(self.vec) and self.col >= len(self.vec[self.row]):

self.row += 1

self.col = 0

def next(self) -> int:

self.advance_to_next()

element = self.vec[self.row][self.col]

self.col += 1

return element

def hasNext(self) -> bool:

self.advance_to_next()

return self.row < len(self.vec)

This seems clean. The `advance_to_next` method handles moving to the next non-empty row.

Wait, actually, in `next()`, after returning the element, I need to increment `col`, not `row`. And `hasNext()` should call `advance_to_next` to ensure that `row` and `col` are correctly positioned.

Let me verify with the earlier example:

Input: [[1,2], [3], [4]]

- Initialize: row=0, col=0

- next(): advance_to_next() -> row=0, col=0 (since vec[0] has elements)

- return vec[0][0]=1, col=1

- next(): advance_to_next() -> row=0, col=1

- return vec[0][1]=2, col=2

- hasNext(): advance_to_next() -> row=1, col=0

- return True

- next(): return vec[1][0]=3, col=1

- hasNext(): advance_to_next() -> row=2, col=0

- return True

- next(): return vec[2][0]=4, col=1

- hasNext(): advance_to_next() -> row=3, out of bounds

- return False

Perfect.

Another test case: [[], [3,4], [], [5]]

- Initialize: row=0, col=0

- next(): advance_to_next() -> row=1, col=0

- return vec[1][0]=3, col=1

- next(): advance_to_next() -> row=1, col=1

- return vec[1][1]=4, col=2

- next(): advance_to_next() -> row=3, col=0

- return vec[3][0]=5, col=1

- hasNext(): advance_to_next() -> row=4, out of bounds

- return False

Good.

Edge case: [[]]

- Initialize: row=0, col=0

- hasNext(): advance_to_next() -> row=1, out of bounds

- return False

Correct.

Empty vector: []

- Initialize: row=0

- hasNext(): row=0, out of bounds

- return False

Correct.

Seems solid. Now, to implement this in Python.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to design an iterator that can flatten a 2D vector and support `next` and `hasNext` operations efficiently without flattening the entire vector upfront.

### Approach
1. **Initialization:** We store the 2D vector and initialize two pointers: one for the current row (`row`) and one for the current column within that row (`col`).
2. **hasNext:** This method checks if there are more elements available to iterate over. It advances the row and column pointers to the next valid element if necessary.
3. **next:** This method returns the current element and moves the pointers to the next position. It relies on `hasNext` to ensure that there is a next element.

    We use a backtracking algorithm to find all possible combinations of factors. The algorithm starts with `n` and splits it into all possible factors in the range `[2, n]`. We keep track of the current path, which represents the factors found so far. When `n` equals 1, we check if the current path has more than one element. If it does, we add the current combination of factors to the result.

To avoid duplicates, we ensure that the next factor in the sequence is greater than or equal to the previous one by passing a ""start"" variable in the helper function. This ensures that we always explore factors in a non-decreasing order.

At each recursive step, we first check if the current value of `n` is divisible by the current factor (i.e., it has no remainder when divided). If it is, we update the path with the current factor and call the helper function with the updated value of `n` divided by the current factor. After the recursive call returns, we remove the last factor from the path to backtrack to the previous level and explore other factors.

   - We iterate from the starting point to `n//current_product` to find possible factors and recurse with the updated product and path.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is less than 2, there are no factors to consider, so we return an empty list.

   - To avoid duplicates and redundant computations, we sort the factors in non-decreasing order by starting from the current factor.
   - We stop the iteration when the factor exceeds the threshold to prevent unnecessary computations.

1. **Preorder Traversal Properties**:

2. **Stack-Based Solution**:
   - We can use a stack to keep track of nodes as we process the sequence.
   - We maintain a variable to represent the root of the current subtree.
   - For each element in the sequence, we check if it is less than the current root. If so, it should belong to the left subtree.
   - If it is greater than the current root, it should belong to the right subtree.
   - We update the root and stack accordingly to ensure the BST properties are maintained.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize an empty stack.
   - Initialize a variable `root` with the minimum possible value.
   - Iterate through each element in the preorder sequence:
     - If the current element is less than `root`, return `False` ( violates BST property ).
     - While the stack is not empty and the current element is greater than the top of the stack, pop the stack and update `root`.
     - Push the current element onto the stack.
   - If the entire sequence is processed without violations, return `True`.

Each house can be painted in one of three colors: red, blue, or green, and the cost of painting each house with a certain color is given in a cost matrix.

### Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**:
   - We will use a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to paint house `i` with color `j` (where `j` can be 0 for red, 1 for blue, or 2 for green).
   - For each house, the cost of painting it with a certain color is the sum of the cost of painting it that color and the minimum cost of painting the previous house with a different color.
   - We need to ensure that no two adjacent houses have the same color, so for each house `i` and color `j`, we take the minimum cost from the previous house's different colors (i.e., colors other than `j`).

2. **Initialization**:
   - For the first house, the cost to paint it with each color is simply the given cost for that color.

3. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For each house `i` from 1 to n-1:
     - `dp[i][0] = costs[i][0] + min(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2])`
     - `dp[i][1] = costs[i][1] + min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][2])`
     - `dp[i][2] = costs[i][2] + min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1])`

4. **Final Solution**:
   - The minimum cost to paint all houses will be the minimum value among the costs of painting the last house with any of the three colors.

- Taking num modulo 9 reveals the repeating 0-8 pattern.
- Adding 1 offsets the range back to 1-9.

So, the task is to find two unique numbers in an array where every other number appears exactly twice. The challenge is to do this with linear runtime complexity and constant extra space.

First, let's think about what we know:

- The array contains integers.

- Exactly two elements appear only once.

- All other elements appear exactly twice.

Our goal is to identify those two unique numbers.

### Approach

1. **Understanding XOR Operation**:
   - XOR of a number with itself is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Initial XOR**:
   - If we XOR all the numbers in the array, the numbers that appear twice will cancel out (since X XOR X = 0), and we will be left with the XOR of the two unique numbers.

3. **Finding a Distinguishing Bit**:
   - Let's denote the two unique numbers as A and B.
   - The XOR of A and B (let's call it XOR_AB) will be the result from step 2.
   - Since A and B are different, XOR_AB will have at least one bit set to 1 (the bits where A and B differ).

4. **Grouping and Separating**:
   - We can use any set bit in XOR_AB to partition the original array into two groups:
     - One group where that bit is set.
     - Another group where that bit is not set.
   - Since A and B differ in this bit, they will fall into different groups.
   - The numbers that appear twice will be divided into these groups based on this bit, but since they are identical, they will be split evenly.

5. **XOR Within Groups**:
   - XORing all numbers in each group will cancel out the duplicates, leaving us with A and B.

    The algorithm uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the given graph. During traversal, it checks if there is a cycle (a node visited more than once). A valid tree should not have any cycles, and all nodes must be reachable.

1. Create a list of neighbors for each node.
2. Initialize a visited array to keep track of visited nodes.
3. Call the 'hasCycle' function to perform DFS and also check the existence of a cycle.
4. If a cycle exists, return false.
5. If all nodes have not been visited, return false.
6. If there is no cycle and all nodes have been visited, return true.

The 'hasCycle' function checks for the cycle recursively. When visiting a node, mark it as visited. For each neighbor of the current node, if the neighbor is not the parent and has been visited, return true as a cycle is found. If the neighbor is not visited, call the 'hasCycle' function recursively. If the recursion returns true, a cycle has been found. Else, return false as no cycle is found in the current neighbors.
    ","You have a graph of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given an integer n and a list of `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the graph.

Return `true` _if the edges of the given graph make up a valid tree, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, edges = \[\[0,1\],\[0,2\],\[0,3\],\[1,4\]\]
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5, edges = \[\[0,1\],\[1,2\],\[2,3\],\[1,3\],\[1,4\]\]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 2000`
*   `0 <= edges.length <= 5000`
*   `edges[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= ai, bi < n`
*   `ai != bi`
*   There are no self-loops or repeated edges. Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","I've got this problem here. I need to determine if a given set of edges forms a valid tree for a graph with 'n' nodes. The nodes are labeled from 0 to n-1, and I'm given a list of edges, where each edge is a pair [ai, bi] indicating an undirected connection between nodes ai and bi.

First, I need to recall what makes a graph a valid tree. A tree is a special type of graph that is acyclic and connected. That means there are no loops in the graph, and all nodes are connected through some path.

So, to solve this problem, I need to check two main things:

1. **Connectedness:** All nodes should be connected, meaning there's a path from any node to any other node.

2. **Acyclicity:** There should be no cycles in the graph.

Given that the graph is undirected, detecting cycles and checking connectedness can be done efficiently using Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU) data structure or by using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

I'll consider using Union-Find for this problem because it's efficient for handling connectivity queries and cycle detection in undirected graphs.

### Approach

1. **Union-Find Initialization:**
   - Initialize a parent array where each node is its own parent.
   - Initialize a rank array to keep track of the depth of each subset, which helps in union operations.

2. **Union Operations:**
   - For each edge [u, v], perform a union operation.
   - If u and v are already in the same subset (i.e., they share the same parent), adding this edge would create a cycle.

3. **Cycle Detection:**
   - If during the union operation, we find that u and v are already connected, then a cycle is detected, and the graph cannot be a tree.

4. **Connectedness Check:**
   - After processing all edges, ensure that all nodes belong to the same subset. If there are multiple subsets, the graph is not connected.

### Solution Code","python

**Constraints:**

Ugly numbers are positive integers whose prime factors are only 2, 3, or 5. For example, the first few ugly numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, and so on.

The challenge is to write a function that, given an integer n, returns the nth ugly number in this sequence. For example, if n is 10, the function should return 12, since 12 is the 10th ugly number.

I need to make sure that my solution is efficient, especially since n can be as large as 1690.

First, I need to understand what makes a number ugly. An ugly number can be divided by 2, 3, or 5, and nothing else. So, one way to approach this is to generate all positive integers and check each one to see if it's ugly, keeping track of them until I reach the nth one.

But that seems inefficient, especially for larger values of n. Checking each number individually would take a lot of time because I'd have to factorize each number and ensure that only 2, 3, or 5 are its prime factors.

Is there a smarter way to generate ugly numbers directly without checking each integer?

I recall that ugly numbers can be generated by multiplying previous ugly numbers by 2, 3, and 5, and then choosing the smallest one that isn't already in the list.

So, maybe I can use a dynamic programming approach where I maintain a list of ugly numbers and at each step, generate the next ugly number by taking the smallest multiple of 2, 3, or 5 of the previous numbers in the list.

Let me think about this in more detail.

I'll start with the first ugly number, which is 1. Then, I can generate the next ugly numbers by multiplying the existing numbers in the list by 2, 3, and 5, and choosing the smallest one that hasn't been added yet.

For example:

- Start with [1]

- Multiply 1 by 2, 3, and 5 to get 2, 3, 5. The smallest is 2, so add 2.

- Now the list is [1, 2]

- Multiply existing numbers by 2, 3, and 5: 2*2=4, 2*3=6, 2*5=10; 1*2=2 (already in list), 1*3=3, 1*5=5.

- The smallest number not in the list is 3, so add 3.

- Now the list is [1, 2, 3]

- Multiply existing numbers: 3*2=6, 3*3=9, 3*5=15; 2*2=4, 2*3=6, 2*5=10; 1*2=2, 1*3=3, 1*5=5.

- The smallest not in the list is 4, so add 4.

- And so on.

This seems promising. To implement this efficiently, I need to keep track of the next possible multiples for each existing ugly number.

I think I can use three pointers to keep track of the next multiple for 2, 3, and 5.

Let me try to outline the algorithm:

1. Initialize an array to hold the first n ugly numbers, with the first element being 1.

2. Initialize three pointers (or indices) for 2, 3, and 5, all starting at 0.

3. For each new ugly number after the first, calculate the next possible multiples by multiplying the existing ugly numbers at the current pointers by 2, 3, and 5, respectively.

4. Choose the smallest of these multiples as the next ugly number and add it to the array.

5. Increment the pointer for the factor that was used to generate this new ugly number.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 until we have n ugly numbers.

This way, I ensure that each new ugly number is the smallest possible and is generated by multiplying the previous ugly numbers by 2, 3, or 5.

Let me try to write this in code.

First, I'll initialize the list with the first ugly number, which is 1.

Then, I'll have three pointers, let's call them i2, i3, and i5, all starting at 0.

At each step, I'll calculate the next possible multiples:

- next_multiple_of_2 = ugly_numbers[i2] * 2

- next_multiple_of_3 = ugly_numbers[i3] * 3

- next_multiple_of_5 = ugly_numbers[i5] * 5

Then, the next ugly number is the minimum of these three.

I'll add this to the list and increment the pointer that corresponded to this minimum value.

I need to handle the case where multiple multiples are equal; I should increment all the corresponding pointers in that case.

For example, if next_multiple_of_2 and next_multiple_of_3 are equal, I should increment both i2 and i3.

This is important to avoid duplicates in the ugly numbers list.

Let me try to implement this logic in code.

I'll write a function called nthUglyNumber that takes an integer n and returns the nth ugly number.

I need to make sure that the function is efficient enough to handle n up to 1690.

Also, I should consider the space constraints, but since n can be up to 1690, it's manageable.

Let me consider an example to verify my logic.

Take n = 10.

Start with ugly_numbers = [1]

Initialize i2 = 0, i3 = 0, i5 = 0

Iterate 9 times (since we already have the first one):

1. next_multiple_of_2 = 1*2 = 2

next_multiple_of_3 = 1*3 = 3

next_multiple_of_5 = 1*5 = 5

Minimum is 2, so add 2 to the list: [1,2]

Increment i2 to 1

2. next_multiple_of_2 = 2*2 = 4

next_multiple_of_3 = 1*3 = 3

next_multiple_of_5 = 1*5 = 5

Minimum is 3, so add 3 to the list: [1,2,3]

Increment i3 to 1

3. next_multiple_of_2 = 2*2 = 4

next_multiple_of_3 = 2*3 = 6

next_multiple_of_5 = 1*5 = 5

Minimum is 4, so add 4 to the list: [1,2,3,4]

Increment i2 to 2

4. next_multiple_of_2 = 3*2 = 6

next_multiple_of_3 = 2*3 = 6

next_multiple_of_5 = 1*5 = 5

Minimum is 5, so add 5 to the list: [1,2,3,4,5]

Increment i5 to 1

5. next_multiple_of_2 = 3*2 = 6

next_multiple_of_3 = 2*3 = 6

next_multiple_of_5 = 2*5 = 10

Minimum is 6, so add 6 to the list: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Increment i2 and i3 to 3 and 2, respectively

6. next_multiple_of_2 = 4*2 = 8

next_multiple_of_3 = 3*3 = 9

next_multiple_of_5 = 2*5 = 10

Minimum is 8, so add 8 to the list: [1,2,3,4,5,6,8]

Increment i2 to 4

7. next_multiple_of_2 = 4*2 = 8

next_multiple_of_3 = 3*3 = 9

next_multiple_of_5 = 2*5 = 10

Wait, but i2 is now 4, so next_multiple_of_2 = 5*2 = 10

next_multiple_of_3 = 3*3 = 9

next_multiple_of_5 = 2*5 = 10

Minimum is 9, so add 9 to the list: [1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9]

Increment i3 to 3

8. next_multiple_of_2 = 5*2 = 10

next_multiple_of_3 = 3*3 = 9

next_multiple_of_5 = 2*5 = 10

Wait, but i3 is now 3, so next_multiple_of_3 = 4*3 = 12

next_multiple_of_2 = 5*2 = 10

next_multiple_of_5 = 2*5 = 10

Minimum is 10, so add 10 to the list: [1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10]

Increment i2 and i5 to 5 and 2, respectively

9. next_multiple_of_2 = 5*2 = 10

next_multiple_of_3 = 4*3 = 12

next_multiple_of_5 = 3*5 = 15

Minimum is 10, but it's already in the list, so skip and increment i2 to 6

Next next_multiple_of_2 = 6*2 = 12

next_multiple_of_3 = 4*3 = 12

next_multiple_of_5 = 3*5 = 15

Minimum is 12, so add 12 to the list: [1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12]

Now we have 10 ugly numbers, so the 10th is 12.

This matches the example given.

Seems like my logic is correct.

I need to implement this in code carefully, making sure to handle the pointer increments correctly when multiple multiples are equal.

I should also consider edge cases, such as n=1, which should return 1.

Let me think about n=1.

Initialize ugly_numbers = [1]

Since n=1, we don't need to iterate further, just return 1.

Another edge case is n=2, which should return 2.

Let me verify:

Start with [1]

Iterate once:

next_multiple_of_2 = 1*2 = 2

next_multiple_of_3 = 1*3 = 3

next_multiple_of_5 = 1*5 = 5

Minimum is 2, add 2 to the list: [1,2]

Return 2, which is correct.

Seems good.

I should also ensure that the list doesn't contain duplicates, but with the minimal check and pointer increments, this should be handled.

Now, to implement this in Python.

I'll use a list to store the ugly numbers, starting with [1].

Then, I'll have three pointers i2, i3, i5, all starting at 0.

Then, I'll iterate from 1 to n, in each step calculating the next multiples and choosing the smallest one.

I need to make sure that when multiple multiples are equal, I increment all the corresponding pointers.

In Python, I can use a list and keep appending to it.

Let me sketch the code:

def nthUglyNumber(n):

ugly_numbers = [1]

i2 = i3 = i5 = 0

for i in range(1, n):

next_multiple_of_2 = ugly_numbers[i2] * 2

next_multiple_of_3 = ugly_numbers[i3] * 3

next_multiple_of_5 = ugly_numbers[i5] * 5

next_ugly = min(next_multiple_of_2, next_multiple_of_3, next_multiple_of_5)

ugly_numbers.append(next_ugly)

if next_ugly == next_multiple_of_2:

i2 += 1

if next_ugly == next_multiple_of_3:

i3 += 1

if next_ugly == next_multiple_of_5:

i5 += 1

return ugly_numbers[-1]

This seems straightforward.

But I need to make sure that when next_ugly equals more than one of the next multiples, I increment all the corresponding pointers.

For example, if next_multiple_of_2 and next_multiple_of_3 are both equal to the minimum, I need to increment both i2 and i3.

In the code above, I'm checking each condition separately, so if next_ugly equals both next_multiple_of_2 and next_multiple_of_3, both i2 and i3 will be incremented.

That's correct.

Let me test this function with n=10.

ugly_numbers = [1]

i2 = i3 = i5 = 0

Return 12, which is correct.

Looks good.

ugly_numbers = [1]

return ugly_numbers[0] = 1, which is correct.

Another test case: n=1690

I don't want to compute it manually, but I can trust that the logic is correct, and since it's a dynamic programming approach with O(n) time complexity, it should be efficient enough for n up to 1690.

I should also consider the data types, but since ugly numbers grow, and for n=1690, the ugly number is within the range of Python's integers, there shouldn't be any issues.

I think this should work.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the nth ugly number, where ugly numbers are positive integers whose prime factors are only 2, 3, or 5. We will use a dynamic programming approach to efficiently generate the sequence of ugly numbers up to the nth element.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**: Start with the first ugly number, which is 1.
2. **Multiple Pointers**: Maintain three pointers for multiples of 2, 3, and 5.
3. **Generate Ugly Numbers**: For each new ugly number, choose the smallest number from the possible multiples of 2, 3, and 5 from the existing ugly numbers.
4. **Avoid Duplicates**: Ensure that if multiple multiples are equal, all corresponding pointers are incremented to avoid duplicates.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it in `O(nk)` runtime? John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","I'm here to help you with your programming problem. Let's tackle this step by step.

So, the problem is about painting houses with different colors, where each house has different costs for each color, and we can't paint two adjacent houses with the same color. We need to find the minimum cost to paint all houses under these constraints.

First, let's understand the problem clearly. We have a row of n houses, each that can be painted with one of k colors. The cost of painting each house with a specific color is given in a 2D array called costs, where costs[i][j] is the cost to paint house i with color j. The constraint is that no two adjacent houses can have the same color.

Our goal is to find the minimum total cost to paint all houses while respecting this constraint.

Let's look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In Example 1:

costs = [[1,5,3],[2,9,4]]

Possible ways to paint:

1. House 0 with color 0 (cost 1), house 1 with color 2 (cost 4): total cost 5

2. House 0 with color 2 (cost 3), house 1 with color 0 (cost 2): total cost 5

3. Other combinations would have higher costs or violate the adjacency rule.

So, the minimum cost is 5.

In Example 2:

costs = [[1,3],[2,4]]

Possible ways:

1. House 0 with color 0 (cost 1), house 1 with color 1 (cost 4): total cost 5

2. House 0 with color 1 (cost 3), house 1 with color 0 (cost 2): total cost 5

Both valid options give a total cost of 5.

Now, to solve this, we can use dynamic programming because it involves making choices at each step (painting each house) with constraints on previous choices (cannot have the same color as the previous house).

Let's think about how to set up the DP.

We can define dp[i][j] as the minimum cost to paint house i with color j, given the constraints.

The recurrence relation would be:

dp[i][j] = costs[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][m] for m in range(k) if m!= j)

This means that the cost to paint house i with color j is the cost of doing so plus the minimum cost of painting the previous house with any color except j.

Our final answer would be the minimum of dp[n-1][j] for all j from 0 to k-1.

Now, considering the constraints:

- n can be up to 100

- k can be up to 20

- costs[i][j] are between 1 and 20

So, a DP approach with O(n*k^2) time complexity might be acceptable, but the follow-up question asks for an O(n*k) solution.

Let's see how we can optimize this.

In the naive DP approach, for each house i and each color j, we look at all previous colors m (except j) to find the minimum dp[i-1][m].

But this looking back at all previous colors is what makes it O(n*k^2).

To make it O(n*k), we need a way to compute the minimum of dp[i-1][m] for m!= j in O(1) time.

One way to do this is to precompute for each house i, the minimum and the second minimum costs among all colors for house i-1, along with the color index that gives the minimum cost.

Then, for each color j in house i:

- If j is different from the min cost color of house i-1, then dp[i][j] = costs[i][j] + min_cost

- If j is the same as the min cost color of house i-1, then dp[i][j] = costs[i][j] + second_min_cost

This way, we only need to keep track of the minimum and second minimum costs from the previous house, and their corresponding color indices.

This reduces the time complexity to O(n*k), which is the goal.

Let's formalize this approach.

Initialize:

- For house 0, dp[0][j] = costs[0][j] for all j.

Then, for each house i from 1 to n-1:

- Find the minimum and second minimum costs from dp[i-1], along with the color index of the minimum cost.

- For each color j in house i:

- If j is different from the min cost color of house i-1, dp[i][j] = costs[i][j] + min_cost

- Else, dp[i][j] = costs[i][j] + second_min_cost

Finally, the answer is the minimum among dp[n-1][j] for all j.

This should work and achieve the desired time complexity.

Let's consider edge cases:

- n = 1: Only one house, so the minimum cost is the minimum of costs[0][j].

- k = 2: Only two colors, which simplifies the choices but the algorithm remains the same.

- All costs are the same: The minimum cost will be n times that cost, but ensuring no two adjacent houses have the same color.

- Houses with varying costs: The algorithm should handle different cost distributions.

Now, let's think about implementing this in Python.

We'll need to keep track of the DP states. Since n can be up to 100 and k up to 20, a 2D list of size n*k is feasible.

However, to optimize space, we can use two 1D lists: previous and current, to store the dp values for the previous house and the current house being processed.

This way, we don't need to store the entire n*k matrix, which saves space.

But since n is small (100), space is not a major concern here.

Let's sketch the code structure:

def minCostII(costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:

n = len(costs)

if n == 0:

return 0

k = len(costs[0])

if k == 0:

return 0

# Initialize dp

dp = [[0]*k for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize first house

for j in range(k):

dp[0][j] = costs[0][j]

# Iterate over houses

for i in range(1, n):

# Find min and second_min from previous house

min_val = float('inf')

min_idx = -1

second_min = float('inf')

for m in range(k):

if dp[i-1][m] < min_val:

second_min = min_val

min_val = dp[i-1][m]

min_idx = m

elif dp[i-1][m] < second_min:

second_min = dp[i-1][m]

# Assign dp[i][j]

for j in range(k):

if j!= min_idx:

dp[i][j] = costs[i][j] + min_val

else:

dp[i][j] = costs[i][j] + second_min

# The answer is the min of dp[n-1]

return min(dp[-1])

This should work correctly.

To further optimize space, we can use two lists: prev and curr, and alternate between them.

But for clarity, the above approach is sufficient.

Let's test this with Example 1:

costs = [[1,5,3],[2,9,4]]

Initialize dp:

dp[0] = [1,5,3]

Then for i=1:

Find min and second_min from dp[0]: min_val=1, min_idx=0, second_min=3

For j=0:

j!= min_idx (0!= 0), so dp[1][0] = 2 + 1 = 3

For j=1:

j!= min_idx (1!= 0), so dp[1][1] = 9 + 1 = 10

For j=2:

j!= min_idx (2!= 0), so dp[1][2] = 4 + 1 = 5

So dp[1] = [3,10,5]

min(dp[1]) = 3, but according to example, minimum is 5.

Wait, that doesn't match. What's wrong?

Wait, in the example, two possible total costs are 5 and 5.

In my calculation, dp[1] = [3,10,5], and min(dp[1]) = 3, but that seems inconsistent with the example.

Wait, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, no. The dp[i][j] represents the minimum cost to paint up to house i with color j.

In the first house, dp[0] = [1,5,3]

In the second house:

- If painted with color 0: min among previous houses not color 0, which is min(dp[0][1], dp[0][2]) = min(5,3) = 3, so dp[1][0] = 2 + 3 = 5

- If painted with color 1: min among previous houses not color 1, which is min(dp[0][0], dp[0][2]) = min(1,3) = 1, so dp[1][1] = 9 + 1 = 10

- If painted with color 2: min among previous houses not color 2, which is min(dp[0][0], dp[0][1]) = min(1,5) = 1, so dp[1][2] = 4 + 1 = 5

So dp[1] = [5,10,5]

Minimum is 5, which matches the example.

Earlier, I mistakenly thought dp[1][0] was 3, but it should be 5.

So, in the code, when assigning dp[i][j], it should be costs[i][j] + min_val if j!= min_idx else costs[i][j] + second_min

In this case, min_val=1, second_min=3

For j=0: j == min_idx=0, so dp[1][0] = 2 + 3 = 5

For j=1: j!= min_idx, dp[1][1] = 9 + 1 = 10

For j=2: j!= min_idx, dp[1][2] = 4 + 1 = 5

Yes, now it matches.

So the code is correct.

Let's consider another example:

costs = [[1,3],[2,4]]

Initialize dp:

dp[0] = [1,3]

For i=1:

Find min and second_min from dp[0]: min_val=1, min_idx=0, second_min=3

For j=0:

j!= min_idx, dp[1][0] = 2 + 1 = 3

For j=1:

j!= min_idx, dp[1][1] = 4 + 1 = 5

So dp[1] = [3,5], min=3

But according to the example, the output should be 5.

Wait, there's a discrepancy.

In the example, the output is 5, but according to this, it's 3.

But according to the problem, the minimum cost is 5.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that painting house 1 with color 0 (cost 2) and house 0 with color 0 (cost 1), total 3, but in the example, it's 5.

Wait, the example says output is 5, but according to this, it should be 3.

Is there a mistake in the example or in my understanding?

Wait, in the second example:

costs = [[1,3],[2,4]]

Possible ways:

1. House 0 with color 0 (1), house 1 with color 1 (4): total 5

2. House 0 with color 1 (3), house 1 with color 0 (2): total 5

So, indeed, the minimum is 5.

But according to my DP approach, dp[1] = [3,5], min=3, which seems incorrect.

What's wrong here?

Ah, I see the mistake.

In my earlier calculation, for dp[1][0] = 2 + min(dp[0][1]) = 2 + 3 = 5

Wait, no.

Wait, in the earlier step, I incorrectly calculated dp[1][0].

Let's recalculate:

For i=1:

min_val = dp[0][0] = 1, min_idx=0, second_min = dp[0][1] = 3

For j=0:

j == min_idx, so dp[1][0] = costs[1][0] + second_min = 2 + 3 = 5

For j=1:

j!= min_idx, dp[1][1] = costs[1][1] + min_val = 4 + 1 = 5

So dp[1] = [5,5], min=5, which matches the example.

I must have made an error in earlier calculations.

So, in the code, it should be:

if j == min_idx:

dp[i][j] = costs[i][j] + second_min

else:

dp[i][j] = costs[i][j] + min_val

Earlier, I mistakenly thought j!= min_idx for j=0 in the second example, but actually, j=0 is min_idx, so it should be dp[1][0] = 2 + 3 = 5

And dp[1][1] = 4 + 1 = 5

Thus, the minimum is 5, which matches the example.

So, the corrected approach is:

- Find min_val and min_idx from dp[i-1]

- Find second_min from dp[i-1]

- For each j in house i:

- if j == min_idx:

dp[i][j] = costs[i][j] + second_min

- else:

dp[i][j] = costs[i][j] + min_val

This ensures that we don't pick the same color as the previous house.

Now, to implement this in code, we need to handle the case where all colors have the same cost, but in general, this approach should work.

Edge cases to consider:

- n = 1: directly return the minimum of costs[0]

- k = 2: ensure that we correctly alternate colors

- All costs are the same: ensure that we don't pick the same color for adjacent houses

- Costs are varying: ensure that we pick the minimum possible cost without violating the constraint

Also, need to handle cases where min_val and second_min are the same.

Wait, in the case where multiple colors have the same minimum cost, we need to ensure that we correctly identify the second minimum.

In the implementation, when finding min_val and second_min, we need to handle the case where multiple colors have the same cost.

In the earlier approach, when finding min_val and second_min, we iterate through dp[i-1], keep track of the minimum and second minimum, and the index of the minimum.

If there are multiple colors with the same min_val, we need to ensure that second_min is correctly identified.

But in the problem constraints, it's acceptable to have multiple colors with the same cost.

In the DP step, as long as we correctly identify the minimum and second minimum from the previous house, and apply the rules accordingly, it should be fine.

I think the approach is solid.

Now, let's think about implementing this in Python.

We'll use a list of lists for dp, with n rows and k columns.

Initialize dp[0] directly from costs[0]

Then iterate from i=1 to n-1:

- Find min_val, min_idx, second_min from dp[i-1]

- For each j in 0 to k-1:

- if j == min_idx:

dp[i][j] = costs[i][j] + second_min

- else:

dp[i][j] = costs[i][j] + min_val

Finally, return the minimum of dp[n-1]

To optimize space, since we only need the previous row to compute the current row, we can use two lists: prev and curr, and alternate between them.

But for simplicity, I'll stick with the 2D list approach.

Let's write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution

The logic is based on the fact that a string can form a palindrome if it meets the following condition: If the string length is even, there should be an even number of occurrences for each character. If the string length is odd, there should be only one character having odd occurrences and the rest should have even occurrences.

First, I need to understand what a palindrome is. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, like ""racecar"" or ""level"". So, for a string to be able to form a palindrome, it must have certain characteristics in terms of the frequencies of its characters.

I recall that in a palindrome, at most one character can have an odd frequency; all others must have even frequencies. For example, in ""racecar"", 'r' appears twice, 'a' appears twice, 'c' appears twice, and 'e' appears once. So, only one character ('e' in this case) has an odd count.

Given that, I can approach this problem by counting the frequency of each character in the string and then checking how many characters have odd frequencies. If more than one character has an odd frequency, then it's not possible to form a palindrome.

Let me think about the examples provided:

1. **Input:** s = ""code""

- Frequencies: c:1, o:1, d:1, e:1

- All characters have odd frequencies. Since more than one character has an odd frequency, it's not possible to form a palindrome.

- **Output:** false

2. **Input:** s = ""aab""

- Frequencies: a:2, b:1

- One character ('b') has an odd frequency.

- **Output:** true

3. **Input:** s = ""carerac""

- Frequencies: c:2, a:2, r:2, e:1

- Only one character ('e') has an odd frequency.

- **Output:** true

These examples align with my understanding.

Now, how do I implement this in code? I need to count the frequencies of each character in the string. In Python, I can use a dictionary to keep track of the counts.

Here's a rough plan:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store character frequencies.

2. Iterate through each character in the string:

- If the character is already in the dictionary, increment its count.

- If not, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.

3. After counting the frequencies, iterate through the dictionary values and count how many have odd frequencies.

4. If more than one character has an odd frequency, return False; otherwise, return True.

I should also consider edge cases:

- A string with a single character, like ""a"", should return True, as it's a palindrome.

- A string with all characters appearing even times, like ""aabb"", should return True.

- A string with more than one character having an odd count, like ""abc"", should return False.

Let me think about the constraints:

- The string length is between 1 and 5000.

- The string consists only of lowercase English letters.

Given these constraints, performance shouldn't be an issue with a straightforward approach.

I should also consider if there's a way to optimize this. Since the string consists only of lowercase English letters, I could use a list of size 26 to count frequencies, but a dictionary is more straightforward in Python.

Alternatively, I could use the collections.Counter class, which is a subclass of dict specifically for counting hashable objects. It might be more efficient and concise.

Let me think about using Counter:

- Import collections.

- Use Counter(s) to get the frequency dictionary.

- Then, count the number of items with odd counts.

This seems even cleaner.

Let me sketch a sample code:

from collections import Counter

def canPermutePalindrome(s):

count = Counter(s)

odd_count = 0

for val in count.values():

if val % 2!= 0:

odd_count += 1

if odd_count > 1:

return False

return True

This seems straightforward. Let me test it with the provided examples.

Test case 1:

s = ""code""

count = {'c':1, 'o':1, 'd':1, 'e':1}

odd_count = 4

Since odd_count > 1, return False.

Correct.

Test case 2:

s = ""aab""

count = {'a':2, 'b':1}

odd_count = 1

Return True.

Correct.

Test case 3:

s = ""carerac""

count = {'c':2, 'a':2, 'r':2, 'e':1}

odd_count = 1

Return True.

Correct.

Edge case 1:

s = ""a""

count = {'a':1}

odd_count = 1

Return True.

Correct.

Edge case 2:

s = ""aa""

count = {'a':2}

odd_count = 0

Return True.

Correct.

Edge case 3:

s = ""abc""

count = {'a':1, 'b':1, 'c':1}

odd_count = 3

Return False.

Correct.

Seems like this approach works for the test cases.

Is there any way to make this more efficient or concise?

Well, since we're only interested in whether the number of characters with odd counts is at most one, we don't need to count the exact number of odd counts. We can just track a flag that indicates if we've already seen one character with an odd count.

Here's an alternative approach:

- Initialize a variable, say, odd_found = False

- Iterate through the frequency counts:

- If the count is odd:

- If odd_found is already True, return False

- Else, set odd_found = True

- Return True

This way, we early return as soon as we find more than one character with an odd count.

This might be slightly more efficient, as it could potentially short-circuit and return False earlier.

Let me adjust the code accordingly:

from collections import Counter

def canPermutePalindrome(s):

count = Counter(s)

odd_found = False

for val in count.values():

if val % 2!= 0:

if odd_found:

return False

else:

odd_found = True

return True

Let's test this with the same test cases to ensure correctness.

Test case 1:

s = ""code""

count = {'c':1, 'o':1, 'd':1, 'e':1}

Iterate through counts:

1 is odd, set odd_found = True

Next 1 is odd, since odd_found is True, return False

Correct.

Test case 2:

s = ""aab""

count = {'a':2, 'b':1}

Iterate through counts:

2 is even

1 is odd, set odd_found = True

End of loop, return True

Correct.

Test case 3:

s = ""carerac""

count = {'c':2, 'a':2, 'r':2, 'e':1}

Iterate through counts:

2,2,2 are even

1 is odd, set odd_found = True

End of loop, return True

Correct.

Edge case 1:

s = ""a""

count = {'a':1}

1 is odd, set odd_found = True

End of loop, return True

Correct.

Edge case 2:

s = ""aa""

count = {'a':2}

All even, return True

Correct.

Edge case 3:

s = ""abc""

count = {'a':1, 'b':1, 'c':1}

1 is odd, set odd_found = True

Next 1 is odd, since odd_found is True, return False

Correct.

Looks good.

Is there any further optimization possible?

Given the constraints, with n <= 5000, and only 26 lowercase English letters, the time complexity is O(n + 26), which is effectively O(n). This is acceptable.

Alternatively, since the number of unique characters is small, the time complexity is practically O(1), as the loop runs at most 26 times.

Space-wise, using a Counter or a dictionary to store up to 26 characters is also fine.

I think this is a solid solution.

Let me consider if there's a way to make it even more Pythonic.

I could use the values() of the Counter and check the number of odd counts using a generator expression.

For example:

from collections import Counter

def canPermutePalindrome(s):

count = Counter(s)

return sum(val % 2 for val in count.values()) <= 1

This is concise and straightforward. It sums up all the odd counts and checks if the sum is less than or equal to 1.

Let's test this with the same test cases.

Test case 1:

s = ""code""

count = {'c':1, 'o':1, 'd':1, 'e':1}

sum(val % 2 for val in count.values()) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

4 <= 1? False

Correct.

Test case 2:

s = ""aab""

count = {'a':2, 'b':1}

sum(val % 2) = 0 + 1 = 1

1 <= 1? True

Correct.

Test case 3:

s = ""carerac""

count = {'c':2, 'a':2, 'r':2, 'e':1}

sum(val % 2) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1

1 <= 1? True

Correct.

Edge case 1:

s = ""a""

count = {'a':1}

sum(val % 2) = 1

1 <= 1? True

Correct.

Edge case 2:

s = ""aa""

count = {'a':2}

sum(val % 2) = 0

0 <= 1? True

Correct.

Edge case 3:

s = ""abc""

count = {'a':1, 'b':1, 'c':1}

sum(val % 2) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

3 <= 1? False

Correct.

This single-line solution is clean and efficient. I think this is the best way to approach this problem in Python.

I should also consider if there's a way to do this without using Counter, in case I need to implement it differently.

Alternative approach without Counter:

- Initialize a set to track characters with odd counts.

- Iterate through each character in the string:

- If the character is already in the set, remove it.

- If not, add it to the set.

- After processing all characters, check if the length of the set is less than or equal to 1.

This works because each time a character appears twice, it's added and then removed from the set, effectively canceling out. Characters with an odd count will remain in the set.

Let's try this approach.

Sample code:

def canPermutePalindrome(s):

seen = set()

for char in s:

if char in seen:

seen.remove(char)

else:

seen.add(char)

return len(seen) <= 1

Test case 1:

s = ""code""

Processing:

c: add c -> set={c}

o: add o -> set={c, o}

d: add d -> set={c, o, d}

e: add e -> set={c, o, d, e}

len(set) = 4 > 1 -> False

Correct.

Test case 2:

s = ""aab""

Processing:

a: add a -> {a}

a: remove a -> {}

b: add b -> {b}

len(set) = 1 <=1 -> True

Correct.

Test case 3:

s = ""carerac""

Processing:

c: add c -> {c}

a: add a -> {c, a}

r: add r -> {c, a, r}

e: add e -> {c, a, r, e}

r: remove r -> {c, a, e}

a: remove a -> {c, e}

c: remove c -> {e}

len(set) = 1 <=1 -> True

Correct.

Edge case 1:

s = ""a""

Processing:

a: add a -> {a}

len(set) =1 <=1 -> True

Correct.

Edge case 2:

s = ""aa""

Processing:

a: add a -> {a}

a: remove a -> {}

len(set) =0 <=1 -> True

Correct.

Edge case 3:

s = ""abc""

Processing:

a: add a -> {a}

b: add b -> {a, b}

c: add c -> {a, b, c}

len(set) =3 >1 -> False

Correct.

This approach is also correct and efficient, with a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1), since the set can grow up to 26 characters.

I prefer this approach for its efficiency and simplicity.

Comparing the two approaches:

1. Using Counter and summing odd counts:

- Concise and Pythonic.

- Slightly higher space usage due to the Counter object.

2. Using a set to track odd counts:

- Efficient in terms of space, as it only stores characters with odd counts.

- Slightly more code, but still very clean.

I think the set approach is preferable for its efficiency, but both are acceptable.

I should also consider the performance difference between the two. Given that the string length is up to 5000, and the number of unique characters is limited, both approaches will perform well.

However, the set approach might be slightly faster in practice because it doesn't require counting all frequencies, but rather just tracking the parity of counts.

But in reality, the performance difference would be negligible for the given constraints.

Given that, I'll go with the set approach for its efficiency.

Let me finalize the code:

def canPermutePalindrome(s):

seen = set()

for char in s:

if char in seen:

seen.remove(char)

else:

seen.add(char)

return len(seen) <= 1

This should work as expected.

I can also consider using a bitmask if I want to optimize space further, but given that there are only 26 lowercase English letters, the set approach is more than sufficient and easier to understand.

I think this is a good solution to the problem.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if a permutation of the given string can form a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. For a string to be able to form a palindrome, at most one character can have an odd frequency, and all other characters must have even frequencies.

### Approach
1. Use a set to track characters with odd frequencies.
2. Iterate through each character in the string:
   - If the character is already in the set, remove it.
   - If the character is not in the set, add it.
3. After processing all characters, check if the set has at most one character with an odd frequency.

So, the problem is to generate all unique palindromic permutations from a given string `s`. If no such palindrome can be formed, we should return an empty list.

First, we need to understand what a palindrome is. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. For a string to have a palindromic permutation, it must satisfy certain conditions based on the frequencies of its characters.

### Approach

1. **Check if a Palindromic Permutation is Possible:**
   - Count the frequency of each character in the string.
   - For a string to have a palindromic permutation:
     - If the length of the string is even, every character must appear an even number of times.
     - If the length is odd, exactly one character can appear an odd number of times (which will be the middle character in the palindrome).

2. **Generate Palindromic Permutations:**
   - If the string can form a palindrome, we'll generate all unique permutations that are palindromes.
   - We'll use backtracking to generate these permutations efficiently.

    The algorithm uses the topological sorting algorithm with an adjacency list to represent the directed graph. The directed graph's vertices represent each unique character from the words array, and a directed edge between two vertices indicates that the first character appears before the second character in the alien language's dictionary.

It first initializes an adjacency list `graph`, an in-degree HashMap `inDegree` to store the in-degree of each character, and fills the HashMap with the unique characters from the words array, setting the initial in-degree of each character to 0. Then, it iterates through adjacent word pairs from the `words` array and adjacent character pairs from those word pairs, checking if they form an edge in the graph (i.e., the characters are different). If an edge is found, it is added to the graph, and the in-degree of the second character in the pair is incremented. In case we traverse through equal characters and later find the second string is shorter, we return an empty string as this indicates an invalid order.

To find the lexicographical order, we can use the topological sorting algorithm. We initialize a queue to store the characters with an in-degree of 0 (i.e. they have no incoming edges) and perform the following steps until the queue is empty:

1. Pop the front character from the queue and append it to the result string.
2. Iterate over all the neighbors of the popped character in the graph.
3. Decrement the in-degree of each neighbor.
4. Check if the in-degree of the neighbor is 0; if it is, push the character onto the queue.

Finally, if the length of the result string is less than the number of unique characters, return an empty string as it indicates there's no valid lexicographical order. Otherwise, return the result string.

The goal is to return a string of unique letters in increasing order according to the alien language's rules. If there's no valid solution, I should return an empty string.

First, I need to understand what lexicographical order means in this context. In Earth's languages, lexicographical order is based on the dictionary order of characters. For example, in English, ""a"" comes before ""b"", which comes before ""c"", and so on. Here, the alien language uses the English alphabet, but the order of letters is different and unknown to us. We need to deduce this order based on the given list of words that are sorted according to this unknown order.

Let's look at the first example:

words = [""wrt"", ""wrf"", ""er"", ""ett"", ""rftt""]

The output is ""wertf"". This means that based on the way these words are ordered, we can deduce that 'w' comes before 'e', 'r' comes before 'f', and so on.

To solve this, I think I need to model the problem as a graph where nodes are the unique letters, and directed edges represent the order between letters. For example, if 'a' comes before 'b' in some word comparison, I can draw an edge from 'a' to 'b'.

So, the steps might be:

1. **Build the graph:**

- Iterate through the list of words and compare adjacent words to find orderings between letters.

- For each pair of adjacent words, find the first position where the letters differ, and create an edge from the letter in the first word to the letter in the second word.

2. **Find the topological order:**

- Once the graph is built, perform a topological sort to get the order of letters.

- If there is a cycle in the graph, return an empty string because there is no valid order.

3. **Handle edge cases:**

- Ensure that all unique letters are included in the graph, even if they don't appear in any comparison.

- Handle cases where there are multiple possible valid orders by returning any one of them.

Let me think about how to implement this.

**Building the graph:**

- I need to collect all unique letters from all words.

- Then, compare each pair of adjacent words to find ordering constraints.

- For example, comparing ""wrt"" and ""wrf"", the first two letters are the same, but the third letters differ: 't' and 'f'. Since ""wrt"" comes before ""wrf"", 't' must come before 'f' in the alien language.

- Similarly, comparing ""wrf"" and ""er"", the first letters differ: 'w' and 'e', so 'w' comes before 'e'.

- Continue this process for all adjacent pairs.

**Finding the topological order:**

- I can use a depth-first search (DFS) based approach to perform the topological sort.

- I'll need to keep track of visited nodes and detect if there is a cycle.

- Start from nodes with no incoming edges and proceed accordingly.

**Handling all unique letters:**

- Ensure that even letters that don't have any ordering constraints are included in the final order.

- For example, if a letter doesn't appear in any comparison but is present in some word, it should still be included in the final string, placed anywhere in the order.

**Example walk-through:**

Take words = [""wrt"", ""wrf"", ""er"", ""ett"", ""rftt""]

- Unique letters: w, r, t, f, e

- Comparing ""wrt"" and ""wrf"": 't' < 'f'

- Comparing ""wrf"" and ""er"": 'w' < 'e'

- Comparing ""er"" and ""ett"": 'r' < 't'

- Comparing ""ett"" and ""rftt"": 'e' < 'r'

- So, the constraints are: t < f, w < e, r < t, e < r

- Wait, e < r and r < t, so e < r < t

- And t < f

- Also, w < e

- So the order is w < e < r < t < f

- Which matches the output ""wertf""

**Another example:**

words = [""z"", ""x""]

- Unique letters: z, x

- Comparing ""z"" and ""x"": 'z' < 'x'

- So, order is z < x

- Output: ""zx""

**Third example:**

words = [""z"", ""x"", ""z""]

- Unique letters: z, x

- Comparing ""z"" and ""x"": 'z' < 'x'

- Comparing ""x"" and ""z"": 'x' < 'z'

- This creates a cycle: z < x and x < z

- Which is invalid, so return """"

Okay, now think about how to implement this in code.

**Plan:**

1. **Build the graph:**

- Initialize a set of all unique letters from the words.

- Initialize an adjacency list for the graph.

- Iterate through the list of words and compare adjacent words:

- For each pair, find the first differing character and add an edge from the character in the first word to the character in the second word.

2. **Handle invalid cases:**

- If a word is a prefix of the next word, e.g., [""abc"", ""ab""], it's invalid because ""abc"" should come after ""ab"" lexicographically. So, return """"

3. **Perform topological sort:**

- Use DFS to perform topological sort.

- Keep track of visited nodes and nodes in the current path to detect cycles.

4. **Construct the result:**

- If there are no cycles, construct the string from the topological order.

- If there are cycles, return """"

**Implementing the graph building:**

- For comparing two words, find the first index where they differ and add an edge from the character in the first word to the character in the second word.

- If one word is a prefix of the other and is longer, it's invalid.

**Implementing topological sort:**

- Use a visited array to track visited nodes.

- Use a path array to track nodes in the current path to detect cycles.

- During DFS, if a node is already in the current path, a cycle exists.

- If no cycles are found, collect the nodes in the order they are finished in DFS.

**Edge cases to consider:**

- All words are the same.

- Words are already in a valid order with no contradictions.

- Words cause cycles in the graph.

- Words with different lengths.

- Words that are prefixes of others.

**Let me think about the implementation in code.**

I'll need:

- A set to collect all unique letters.

- A dictionary for the adjacency list.

- Functions for DFS topological sort.

- Handling the comparison between adjacent words.

**Implementing comparison between words:**

- For two words, find the first differing character.

- If no differing character is found and one word is longer than the other, it's invalid.

**Implementing topological sort:**

- Use a stack to collect the nodes in order.

- Mark nodes as visited to avoid revisiting.

- Keep track of the path to detect cycles.

**Let me sketch a rough code structure.**

Initialize unique letters:

all_letters = set()

for word in words:

for char in word:

all_letters.add(char)

Build graph:

graph = {char: [] for char in all_letters}

for i in range(len(words) - 1):

word1 = words[i]

word2 = words[i+1]

for c1, c2 in zip(word1, word2):

if c1!= c2:

graph[c1].append(c2)

break

else:

# No differencing character found

if len(word1) > len(word2):

return """"

Perform topological sort:

visited = {}

path = {}

order = []

def dfs(node):

if node in path:

return True  # cycle detected

if node in visited:

return False

visited[node] = True

path[node] = True

for neighbor in graph[node]:

if dfs(neighbor):

return True

path[node] = False

order.append(node)

for node in graph:

if dfs(node):

return """"

return """".join(reversed(order))

Wait, this is a rough sketch. I need to refine it.

**Refining the graph building:**

- The way I'm currently adding edges might not be sufficient. In the example, comparing ""wrt"" and ""wrf"", I add t -> f.

- But I need to ensure that all orderings are captured.

- Also, need to handle cases where one word is a prefix of another.

**Handling one word being a prefix of another:**

- If two words are ""ab"" and ""abc"", and ""ab"" comes before ""abc"", that's fine.

- But if ""abc"" comes before ""ab"", it's invalid.

- So, in my comparison, if I reach the end of one word without finding a differing character, I need to check which word is longer.

- If the first word is longer, it's invalid.

- If the second word is longer, it's fine.

**Implementing this in code:**

for i in range(len(words) - 1):

word1 = words[i]

word2 = words[i+1]

min_len = min(len(word1), len(word2))

for j in range(min_len):

if word1[j]!= word2[j]:

graph[word1[j]].append(word2[j])

break

else:

# No differing character found

if len(word1) > len(word2):

return """"

**Topological sort implementation:**

I can use Khan's algorithm or DFS. I'll use DFS as sketched earlier.

**Implementing DFS for topological sort:**

- Maintain a visited dictionary.

- Maintain a path dictionary to track the current path.

- If a node is already in the path, it's a cycle.

- Collect nodes in order as they finish DFS.

**Constructing the order:**

- Reverse the stack to get the correct order.

**Let me think about multiple solutions:**

- If there are multiple valid orders, any one is acceptable.

- So, the topological sort can return any valid order.

**Let me consider the third example:**

words = [""z"", ""x"", ""z""]

- Unique letters: z, x

- Comparing ""z"" and ""x"": z < x

- Comparing ""x"" and ""z"": x < z

- So, z < x and x < z, which is a cycle.

- Should return """"

**Another test case:**

words = [""ab"", ""abc"", ""ac""]

- Unique letters: a, b, c

- Comparing ""ab"" and ""abc"": no differing character in position, but ""ab"" is prefix of ""abc"", which is fine.

- Comparing ""abc"" and ""ac"": first differing character is 'b' vs 'a', so b < a

- So, order is b < a, and c is independent.

- Possible orders: b < a < c or b < c < a

- So, ""bac"" or ""bca"" are both valid.

**Another test case:**

words = [""a"", ""b"", ""a""]

- Unique letters: a, b

- Comparing ""a"" and ""b"": a < b

- Comparing ""b"" and ""a"": b < a

- Cycle: a < b and b < a

- Invalid, return """"

**Seems like the logic is sound.**

Now, I need to implement this in Python.

**Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of alien letters based on a list of words that are sorted lexicographically in that alien language. We will use a graph-based approach to model the relationships between letters and then perform a topological sort to find the correct order.

### Approach

1. **Build the Graph:**
   - Collect all unique letters from the words.
   - Compare adjacent words to find the first differing character and create a directed edge from the character in the first word to the character in the second word.
   - If one word is a prefix of another and appears after it, return an empty string as it's invalid.

2. **Topological Sort:**
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to perform the topological sort.
   - Track visited nodes and the current path to detect cycles.
   - If a cycle is detected, return an empty string.
   - Collect the nodes in the order they finish the DFS.

3. **Construct the Result:**
   - Reverse the collected order to get the correct lexicographical order.
   - Ensure all unique letters are included in the result.

First, I need to understand what a BST is. In a BST, for any given node, all the nodes in its left subtree have values less than its own, and all the nodes in its right subtree have values greater than its own. This property makes BSTs efficient for search operations.

So, the task is to find the value in the BST that is closest to the given target. If there are multiple values equally close to the target, I should return the smallest one.

I'll start by thinking about how to traverse the BST to find the closest value. Since it's a BST, I can leverage its properties to efficiently find the closest node without having to visit every node.

One approach is to start from the root and iteratively move down the tree, choosing the left or right subtree based on whether the target is less than or greater than the current node's value. At each step, I'll keep track of the closest value found so far.

Let me think about this in more detail:

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the closest value found so far. Let's call it `closest_value`. I can set it initially to the root's value.

2. Start at the root and iterate through the tree:

a. At each node, calculate the difference between the node's value and the target.

b. If this difference is smaller than the difference between the current `closest_value` and the target, update `closest_value` to the current node's value.

c. If the target is less than the current node's value, move to the left child.

d. If the target is greater than the current node's value, move to the right child.

e. If the target is equal to the current node's value, we've found the exact match, which is the closest possible, so we can return it immediately.

3. Continue this process until we reach a leaf node (a node with no children).

4. Finally, return the `closest_value`.

This seems like an efficient approach because it avoids traversing the entire tree and instead follows a single path from the root to a leaf, which should be O(log n) time complexity in a balanced BST, where n is the number of nodes.

However, I should consider the case where the BST is heavily unbalanced, making the time complexity up to O(n). But given the constraints, with up to 10^4 nodes, it should still be acceptable.

Now, I need to handle the scenario where there are multiple values equally close to the target. In such cases, I need to return the smallest one.

To handle this, I need to modify the comparison slightly. If the difference between a node's value and the target is equal to the current smallest difference, I should compare the node's value with the current `closest_value` and choose the smaller one.

Let me think about how to implement this.

I'll need to keep track of the smallest difference found so far and the corresponding `closest_value`. Whenever I find a node with a difference smaller than the current smallest, I update both the smallest difference and the `closest_value`. If the difference is equal to the smallest found so far, I compare the node's value with the current `closest_value` and choose the smaller one.

Here's a rough outline of the steps:

- Initialize `closest_value` to root's value.

- Initialize `smallest_diff` to the absolute difference between root's value and the target.

- Start from the root and iterate down the tree:

- At each node, calculate the difference between the node's value and the target.

- If this difference is smaller than `smallest_diff`:

- Update `smallest_diff` to this new difference.

- Update `closest_value` to the current node's value.

- If this difference is equal to `smallest_diff`:

- Compare the current node's value with `closest_value` and choose the smaller one.

- Decide which subtree to traverse based on whether the target is less than or greater than the current node's value.

- Continue until a leaf node is reached.

- Return `closest_value`.

This should work.

I should also consider edge cases:

- If the tree has only one node, return that node's value.

- If the target is smaller than the smallest value in the tree, the closest value should be the smallest value in the tree.

- If the target is larger than the largest value in the tree, the closest value should be the largest value in the tree.

- If the target is equal to a value in the tree, return that value.

- If there are multiple values equally close, return the smallest one.

I need to make sure my implementation handles these cases correctly.

Let me try to write some pseudocode to visualize this:","function closestValue(root, target):

closest_value = root.val

smallest_diff = abs(root.val - target)

current = root

while current is not None:

diff = abs(current.val - target)

smallest_diff = diff

closest_value = current.val

elif diff == smallest_diff:

closest_value = min(closest_value, current.val)

if target < current.val:

current = current.left

elif target > current.val:

current = current.right

        i = delimiter_pos + 1 + length
    return strs
```

    
    The algorithm concatenates each string with its length and a delimiter (in this case '#'). For example, [""Hello "", ""World ""] would be encoded into ""6#Hello 6#World "" (6 is the length of both ""Hello "" and ""World "").

When decoding, the receiving side searches for the delimiter and extracts the string's length just before each delimiter. It then uses that length to extract the original string extending from the position after the delimiter. It iterates over the received encoded string until all substrings have been extracted.

This algorithm works with any valid ASCII characters as it uses the length of the string in the encoding and decoding process.

The challenge lies in handling strings that may contain any ASCII characters, including delimiters.

### Approach

1. **Encoding:**
   - We need a way to separate the strings in the list such that even if the strings contain delimiters, we can still accurately parse them during decoding.
   - One effective way is to use a fixed-length header to prefix each string with its length. This way, the decoder can read the length first and then extract the exact number of characters that make up the string.

2. **Decoding:**
   - Read the length of the next string from the encoded string.
   - Extract the specified number of characters following the length header.
   - Repeat the process until the entire encoded string is processed.

Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","To solve this problem, we need to find the k values in a Binary Search Tree (BST) that are closest to a given target value. We are guaranteed that there is only one unique set of k values that are closest to the target.

### Approach

1. **In-order Traversal**: Perform an in-order traversal of the BST to get a sorted list of values. This is because BST properties ensure that an in-order traversal will yield values in sorted order.
2. **Find Closest Values**: Once we have the sorted list, we can find the k closest values to the target. This can be efficiently done using a two-pointer approach or by using a min-heap.

First, I need to understand what an h-index is. According to the problem, the h-index is the maximum value h such that the researcher has h papers with at least h citations each. So, for example, if a researcher has 5 papers with citations [3,0,6,1,5], the h-index is 3 because there are 3 papers with at least 3 citations each.

To solve this, I need to find the largest h where there are at least h papers with citations greater than or equal to h.

One way to approach this is to sort the array in descending order and then iterate through it to find the largest h.

Let's consider the first example:

citations = [3,0,6,1,5]

Sorted in descending order: [6,5,3,1,0]

Now, I'll iterate through this sorted list:

- For h=1: The first paper has 6 citations, which is >=1. So, h=1 is valid.

- For h=2: The first two papers have 6 and 5 citations, both >=2. So, h=2 is valid.

- For h=3: The first three papers have 6,5, and 3 citations, all >=3. So, h=3 is valid.

- For h=4: The first four papers have 6,5,3, and 1 citations. The fourth paper has only 1 citation, which is <4. So, h=4 is not valid.

Therefore, the maximum h is 3.

Another example:

citations = [1,3,1]

Sorted in descending order: [3,1,1]

- For h=1: The first paper has 3 citations, which is >=1. So, h=1 is valid.

- For h=2: The first two papers have 3 and 1 citations. The second paper has only 1 citation, which is <2. So, h=2 is not valid.

Therefore, the maximum h is 1.

This seems like a straightforward approach. Now, let's think about how to implement this in code.

I can sort the array in descending order and then iterate through it, checking for each h from 1 to n (where n is the number of papers):

- For each h, check if the h-th paper has at least h citations.

- The largest h where this condition holds true is the h-index.

However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting, where n is the number of papers.

Is there a more efficient way to do this?

Let's think about counting the number of papers with citations greater than or equal to a certain value.

Since the citations[i] can be up to 1000, and n can be up to 5000, we can consider using a counting sort-like approach.

We can create a frequency array where freq[c] represents the number of papers with c citations.

Then, we can iterate from high citations to low, keeping a running count of papers with citations >= h, and find the maximum h where this count >= h.

This might be more efficient, but since sorting is already O(n log n), and with n up to 5000, it should be acceptable.

Let me try to implement the sorted approach first.

Here's a plan:

1. Sort the citations array in descending order.

2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the h-index.

3. Iterate through the sorted array with index h starting from 0:

- For each h, check if citations[h] >= h+1.

- If true, set h_index = h+1.

- If false, break the loop.

4. Return the h_index.

Let me test this logic with the first example:

citations = [3,0,6,1,5]

Sorted: [6,5,3,1,0]

- h=0: citations[0]=6 >=1 → h_index=1

- h=1: citations[1]=5 >=2 → h_index=2

- h=2: citations[2]=3 >=3 → h_index=3

- h=3: citations[3]=1 >=4 → false → break

- h_index=3

Second example:

citations = [1,3,1]

Sorted: [3,1,1]

- h=0: citations[0]=3 >=1 → h_index=1

- h=1: citations[1]=1 >=2 → false → break

- h_index=1

Seems correct.

Now, let's consider edge cases:

- citations = [0,0,0] → sorted [0,0,0]

- h=0: citations[0]=0 >=1 → false → h_index=0

- citations = [100,100,100] → sorted [100,100,100]

- h=0: citations[0]=100 >=1 → h_index=1

- h=1: citations[1]=100 >=2 → h_index=2

- h=2: citations[2]=100 >=3 → h_index=3

- h=3: citations[3] doesn't exist → stop

- h_index=3

- citations = [1] → sorted [1]

- h=0: citations[0]=1 >=1 → h_index=1

- h=1: citations[1] doesn't exist → stop

- h_index=1

- citations = [0] → sorted [0]

- h=0: citations[0]=0 >=1 → false → h_index=0

Seems correct.

Now, let's think about the implementation in code.

I need to sort the array in descending order. In Python, I can use sorted(citations, reverse=True).

Then, iterate through the sorted array with index h from 0 to len(citations)-1:

- If citations[h] >= h+1, set h_index = h+1

- Else, break

Return h_index

This should work.

Alternatively, I can use a more Pythonic approach with enumerate:

sorted_citations = sorted(citations, reverse=True)

for h, citation in enumerate(sorted_citations, start=1):

if citation < h:

return h-1

return len(citations)

But wait, in this case, if all papers have citations >= h, then h_index is len(citations).

Yes, that makes sense.

Wait, in the earlier examples, it worked correctly.

Wait, in the first example, h_index=3, which is correct.

In the second example, h_index=1, correct.

In the edge cases, also correct.

Alright, I think this approach is solid.

Now, let's write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to compute the h-index for a researcher given an array of citations for each paper. The h-index is defined as the maximum value h such that the researcher has published h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

### Approach
1. **Sort the citations array in descending order**: This allows us to start with the highest citations and iterate downwards.
2. **Iterate through the sorted array**: For each index h (starting from 1), check if the citation count at that index is at least h.
3. **Determine the h-index**: Continue increasing h as long as the citation count is greater than or equal to h. When this condition fails, the previous h is the h-index.
4. **Handle the case where all papers have citations greater than or equal to their index**: If the loop completes without the condition failing, the h-index is equal to the number of papers.

    The algorithm is based on binary search. The idea is to find the pivot index 'mid' such that there are 'mid' number of elements greater than or equal to 'mid'. Since the array is sorted, we can leverage binary search by comparing the middle element's value to the number of elements on its right side (which can be calculated as 'n - mid'). If the number of elements on the right side is equal to the value at mid, we found the h-index. Otherwise, if the number of elements on the right side is less than the value at mid, we move our search to the left half of the array. If the number of elements is greater than the value at mid, we move our search to the right half of the array. This process ensures logarithmic time complexity as we eliminate half of the array in each iteration. Once our search is complete (right becomes less than left), we return the final h-index as 'n - left'.

The h-index is defined as the maximum value `h` such that the researcher has at least `h` papers with `h` citations each.

Given that the array is sorted in ascending order, we can leverage binary search to achieve a logarithmic time complexity, which is efficient for large input sizes.

### Approach

1. **Understanding H-Index**: 
   - The h-index is the largest number `h` such that there are at least `h` papers with `h` or more citations.
   - For a given index `i` in the sorted array, the number of papers with at least `citations[i]` citations is `(n - i)`, where `n` is the total number of papers.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - We use binary search to find the optimal `h` value.
   - At each step, we check if the middle element `citations[mid]` is greater than or equal to the number of papers that have at least `citations[mid]` citations, which is `(n - mid)`.
   - If `citations[mid] >= (n - mid)`, it means that there are at least `(n - mid)` papers with `(n - mid)` or more citations. So, we can try to find a higher `h` value by searching the left half.
   - Otherwise, we search the right half.

3. **Termination**:
   - The binary search continues until the low and high pointers meet.
   - The result is the number of papers that have at least `h` citations, which is `(n - low)`.

If n equals 0, it means there are no posts, so the result will be 0.

After that, we create two variables: `same` and `different`. `same` stores the number of ways to color a fence at position i, such that the color of post i is the same as that of post i-1. `different` stores the number of ways to color the post at position i, such that the color of post i is different from that of post i-1.

For the first two posts, there are k ways to paint them the same color, and k*(k-1) ways to paint them different colors.

Then we use a loop starting from the third post (i=2) to the last post (i=n-1).
At each iteration, we update `different` by adding the previous `same` and `different` values and multiply by (k-1). This is because for different colors, they can either come from previous same colors or different colors, hence the addition. And then we multiply it by (k-1) to consider all possible color combinations excluding the previous color. After that, we update `same` by the previous `different` value, because now we need to consider the current post having the same color as the previous post.

*   `1 <= k <= 105`
*   The testcases are generated such that the answer is in the range `[0, 231 - 1]` for the given `n` and `k`. John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","I've got this problem here about painting a fence with some specific rules. So, let's break it down. We have n posts and k different colors to choose from. Each post must be painted with exactly one color, and we can't have three or more consecutive posts with the same color. I need to find out how many ways there are to paint the fence following these rules.

First, I need to understand the constraints. For n posts and k colors, the total number of ways without any restrictions would be k^n, because each post can be any of the k colors independently. But here, there are restrictions: no three consecutive posts can be the same color.

So, I need to find a way to count only those colorings where no three consecutive posts have the same color.

I think dynamic programming could be a good approach here, because we can build up the solution by considering one post at a time and keeping track of the valid colorings up to that point.

Let me think about how to set up the DP.

I'll define dp[i][j], where i is the post number (from 1 to n), and j is the color used for that post. But that might not be efficient, especially since k can be up to 10^5.

Wait, k can be up to 10^5, which is quite large, and n can be up to 50, which is manageable. So, I need a DP approach that doesn't rely on tracking each color individually, because that could be too slow.

Maybe I can track the number of valid colorings up to post i, considering the colors of the previous one or two posts.

Let me consider the state of the last two posts:

- If the last two posts have the same color, then the third last post must be a different color.

- If the last two posts have different colors, then the third last post can be any color, as long as the last two are different.

Wait, but the restriction is about not having three consecutive posts with the same color. So, as long as we don't have three in a row with the same color, it's okay to have alternating colors or any other pattern that avoids three same colors in a row.

I need to find a way to count the number of valid sequences of length n with k colors, where no three consecutive elements are the same.

I recall that in DP problems involving sequences with restrictions on consecutive elements, it's useful to keep track of the previous state, such as the color of the previous post.

Perhaps I can define dp[i][0] as the number of valid colorings up to post i where the last two posts have different colors, and dp[i][1] where the last two posts have the same color.

Then, the total number of valid colorings up to post i would be dp[i][0] + dp[i][1].

Now, let's think about how to transition from post i-1 to post i.

- If the last two posts have different colors (dp[i-1][0]), then for post i:

- We can choose a color different from the previous post's color, which would make the last two posts have different colors: dp[i][0] += dp[i-1][0] * (k-1)

- Or we can choose the same color as the previous post, which would make the last two posts have the same color: dp[i][1] += dp[i-1][0] * 1

- If the last two posts have the same color (dp[i-1][1]), then for post i:

- We can choose a color different from the previous post's color, which would make the last two posts have different colors: dp[i][0] += dp[i-1][1] * (k-1)

- We cannot choose the same color again, because that would make three consecutive posts with the same color, which is invalid.

So, summarizing the transitions:

dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] * (k-1) + dp[i-1][1] * (k-1)

dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][0] * 1

Wait, that seems off. Let's double-check.

If the previous state is dp[i-1][0], meaning the last two posts up to i-1 have different colors:

- Choosing a color different from the (i-1)th post's color would make the last two posts at i have different colors.

- Choosing the same color as the (i-1)th post would make the last two posts at i have the same color.

If the previous state is dp[i-1][1], meaning the last two posts up to i-1 have the same color:

- Choosing a color different from the (i-1)th post's color would make the last two posts at i have different colors.

- Choosing the same color again would make three consecutive posts with the same color, which is invalid.

Therefore, the correct transitions are:

dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] * (k-1) + dp[i-1][1] * (k-1)

dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][0] * 1

Wait, but in the first part, dp[i][0] should be the number of ways where the last two posts have different colors. So, if the previous state is dp[i-1][0], and we choose a color different from the previous post, that's fine. If the previous state is dp[i-1][1], and we choose a color different from the previous post, that's also fine.

But in the first transition, dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] * (k-1) + dp[i-1][1] * (k-1), that seems correct.

And dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][0] * 1, because only if the last two posts up to i-1 have different colors can we choose the same color as the (i-1)th post to make the last two posts at i have the same color.

Wait, but in dp[i][1], it's the number of ways where the last two posts have the same color. So, to get to dp[i][1], we must have the (i-1)th and i-th posts having the same color, and the (i-2)th post must be different from the (i-1)th post, to avoid three in a row.

Actually, maybe my definition of dp[i][1] needs to be adjusted.

Let me try redefining the states.

Alternative approach:

Define dp[i][0] as the number of valid colorings up to post i where the i-th and (i-1)-th posts have different colors.

dp[i][1] as the number of valid colorings up to post i where the i-th and (i-1)-th posts have the same color.

Then, the total number of valid colorings up to post i is dp[i][0] + dp[i][1].

Now, for dp[i][0]:

- If the last two posts have different colors, then the (i-1)-th and (i-2)-th posts can be in any valid state.

But wait, perhaps I need to consider the previous state more carefully.

Actually, dp[i][0] can be derived from both dp[i-1][0] and dp[i-1][1]:

- From dp[i-1][0]: the (i-1)-th and (i-2)-th posts have different colors. Then, for post i, we can choose any color except the color of the (i-1)-th post, to ensure that the i-th and (i-1)-th posts have different colors. So, dp[i][0] += dp[i-1][0] * (k-1)

- From dp[i-1][1]: the (i-1)-th and (i-2)-th posts have the same color. Then, for post i, we can choose any color except the color of the (i-1)-th post, to avoid three in a row. So, dp[i][0] += dp[i-1][1] * (k-1)

Similarly, dp[i][1] can only be derived from dp[i-1][0]:

- From dp[i-1][0]: the (i-1)-th and (i-2)-th posts have different colors. Then, for post i, we can choose the same color as the (i-1)-th post, making the i-th and (i-1)-th posts have the same color. So, dp[i][1] += dp[i-1][0] * 1

- From dp[i-1][1], we cannot choose the same color again, because that would make three in a row, which is invalid.

Therefore, the transitions are:

dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] * (k-1) + dp[i-1][1] * (k-1)

dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][0] * 1

Wait, but in the second term of dp[i][0], dp[i-1][1] * (k-1), that seems correct because from dp[i-1][1], we must choose a different color for post i to avoid three in a row.

But looking back, I think there might be a simplification here.

Let me consider the base cases.

For n = 1:

- There are k ways to paint the single post, and no restriction since there are no previous posts.

So, dp[1][0] = k (since the single post doesn't have a previous post to compare to, but for consistency, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps my indexing is off.

Let me adjust the indexing to start from post 1 to n.

Initialize:

- dp[0][0] = 0 (no posts, no different colors)

- dp[0][1] = 0 (no posts, no same colors)

But that doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to think of dp[i] in terms of up to post i.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the previous post's color.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to track the number of valid colorings up to post i, considering whether the i-th post has the same color as the (i-1)-th post.

Let me define:

- same[i]: number of valid colorings up to post i where the i-th post has the same color as the (i-1)-th post.

- diff[i]: number of valid colorings up to post i where the i-th post has a different color from the (i-1)-th post.

Then, the total number of valid colorings up to post i is same[i] + diff[i].

Now, let's find recurrence relations:

- same[i]: to have the i-th post same as the (i-1)-th post, the (i-1)-th post must be different from the (i-2)-th post to avoid three in a row. So, same[i] = diff[i-1] * 1 (since we choose the same color as the previous post)

- diff[i]: to have the i-th post different from the (i-1)-th post, we can come from either same[i-1] or diff[i-1]. From same[i-1], we have to choose a different color, and from diff[i-1], we can choose any color except the color of the (i-1)-th post.

So, diff[i] = same[i-1] * (k-1) + diff[i-1] * (k-1)

Therefore, the recurrences are:

same[i] = diff[i-1]

diff[i] = (same[i-1] + diff[i-1]) * (k-1)

And the total for n posts is same[n] + diff[n]

Now, I need to initialize the base cases.

For n = 1:

- same[1] = 0 (since there is no previous post to compare to)

- diff[1] = k (can be any of the k colors)

Wait, but with n=1, there are no previous posts, so same[1] doesn't apply. So, same[1] = 0, diff[1] = k

For n=2:

- same[2] = diff[1] = k (since diff[1] = k, and same[2] = diff[1] * 1)

- diff[2] = (same[1] + diff[1]) * (k-1) = (0 + k) * (k-1) = k*(k-1)

Total for n=2: same[2] + diff[2] = k + k*(k-1) = k + k^2 - k = k^2

Which makes sense, since for two posts, each can be any of the k colors, and no restriction on consecutive colors yet.

For n=3:

- same[3] = diff[2] = k*(k-1)

- diff[3] = (same[2] + diff[2]) * (k-1) = (k + k*(k-1)) * (k-1) = (k + k^2 - k) * (k-1) = k^2 * (k-1)

Total for n=3: same[3] + diff[3] = k*(k-1) + k^2*(k-1) = k(k-1)(1 + k) = k(k-1)(k+1)

For example, with n=3 and k=2:

Total = 2*1*3 = 6, which matches the first example.

Looks good.

So, I can implement this DP approach, iterating from n=1 up to the given n, calculating same[i] and diff[i] at each step.

Since n can be up to 50, and k up to 10^5, but operations are O(n), which is acceptable.

I need to make sure to handle the base cases correctly.

Let me try to write a small Python function to compute this.

def numWays(n, k):

if n == 0:

return 0

if n == 1:

return k

same = [0] * (n+1)

diff = [0] * (n+1)

same[1] = 0

diff[1] = k

same[2] = diff[1] = k

diff[2] = k * (k-1)

for i in range(3, n+1):

same[i] = diff[i-1]

diff[i] = (same[i-1] + diff[i-1]) * (k-1)

return same[n] + diff[n]

But I can optimize this by using just variables instead of arrays, since I only need the previous values.

Something like:

def numWays(n, k):

if n == 0:

return 0

if n == 1:

return k

same = 0

diff = k

for i in range(2, n+1):

prev_same = same

prev_diff = diff

same = prev_diff

diff = (prev_same + prev_diff) * (k-1)

return same + diff

Wait, but for n=2, same=diff[1]=k, and diff=(same[1]+diff[1])*(k-1)=(0 + k)*(k-1)=k*(k-1)

Total for n=2: k + k*(k-1) = k^2

Which is correct.

For n=3:

same = diff[2] = k*(k-1)

diff = (same[2] + diff[2])*(k-1) = (k + k*(k-1))*(k-1) = k*(k-1)*(1 + k) = k*(k-1)*(k+1)

Total: k*(k-1) + k*(k-1)*(k+1) = k*(k-1)*(1 + k + 1) = k*(k-1)*(k+2)

Wait, but earlier calculation for n=3 was k(k-1)(k+1). There's a discrepancy here.

Wait, let's recalculate.

Wait, no, for n=3:

same[3] = diff[2] = k*(k-1)

diff[3] = (same[2] + diff[2])*(k-1) = (k + k*(k-1))*(k-1) = k*(1 + (k-1))*(k-1) = k*k*(k-1) = k^2*(k-1)

Total: same[3] + diff[3] = k*(k-1) + k^2*(k-1) = k*(k-1)*(1 + k) = k*(k-1)*(k+1)

Earlier, I thought it was k*(k-1)*(k+2), but that was a mistake.

So, total for n=3 is k(k-1)(k+1), which for k=2 is 2*1*3=6, matching the example.

So, the code should be:

def numWays(n, k):

if n == 0:

return 0

if n == 1:

return k

same = 0

diff = k

for i in range(2, n+1):

same, diff = diff, (same + diff) * (k-1)

return same + diff

This should work.

Let me test it with n=3, k=2:

- Initialize same=0, diff=2

- i=2:

- same = 2

- diff = (0 + 2)*(1) = 2

- total = 2 + 2 = 4

- i=3:

- same = 2

- diff = (2 + 2)*(1) = 4

- total = 2 + 4 = 6

Which matches the example.

Another test case: n=1, k=1

- Return 1

Another test case: n=7, k=2

- same=0, diff=2

- i=2: same=2, diff=(0+2)*1=2, total=4

- i=3: same=2, diff=(2+2)*1=4, total=6

- i=4: same=4, diff=(2+4)*1=6, total=10

- i=5: same=6, diff=(4+6)*1=10, total=16

- i=6: same=10, diff=(6+10)*1=16, total=26

- i=7: same=16, diff=(10+16)*1=26, total=42

Which matches the third example.

Looks good.

I can implement this in Python as follows:

def numWays(n, k):

if n == 0:

return 0

if n == 1:

return k

same = 0

diff = k

for i in range(2, n+1):

same, diff = diff, (same + diff) * (k-1)

return same + diff

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to paint a fence with `n` posts using `k` different colors, adhering to the rule that no three consecutive posts can have the same color.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - For 0 posts, there are 0 ways to paint.
   - For 1 post, there are `k` ways to paint it since there are no adjacency restrictions.

2. **Dynamic Programming States**:
   - `same`: Number of ways to paint up to the current post such that the current post has the same color as the previous post.
   - `diff`: Number of ways to paint up to the current post such that the current post has a different color from the previous post.

3. **State Transitions**:
   - To have the current post the same color as the previous one, the previous two posts must not be the same color. Thus, `same[i] = diff[i-1]`.
   - To have the current post a different color from the previous one, it can be any of the `k-1` colors different from the previous post's color. Thus, `diff[i] = (same[i-1] + diff[i-1]) * (k-1)`.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The total number of ways to paint `n` posts is the sum of `same[n]` and `diff[n]`.

**Follow up:** If the maximum number of allowed calls to the API `knows` is `3 * n`, could you find a solution without exceeding the maximum number of calls? Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","So I'm trying to solve this problem about finding a celebrity at a party. There are n people, each labeled from 0 to n-1, and there might be one celebrity among them. The celebrity is someone who everyone else knows, but the celebrity doesn't know anyone else at the party. If there is a celebrity, I need to find their label; otherwise, I should return -1.

I have this helper function called ""knows(a, b)"" that I can use to ask if person a knows person b. The goal is to find the celebrity by asking as few questions as possible.

First, I need to understand the problem better. There are n people, and each of them could potentially be the celebrity. But there's only one celebrity, and that person has the property that everyone knows them, but they don't know anyone else.

So, for example, if there are three people: 0, 1, and 2. If person 1 is the celebrity, then:

- 0 knows 1

- 1 does not know 0

- 1 does not know 2

- 2 knows 1

Also, it's given that everyone knows themselves, so graph[i][i] = 1.

In the first example:

graph = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]

So,

- 0 knows 0 and 1, but not 2

- 1 knows only themselves

- 2 knows everyone

From this, 1 is the celebrity because everyone knows 1, and 1 doesn't know anyone else.

In the second example:

graph = [[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]

- 0 knows themselves and 2

- 1 knows themselves and 0

- 2 knows themselves and 1

Here, there is no celebrity because:

- 0 knows 2, but 2 knows 0, so 0 is not a celebrity

- 1 knows 0, but 0 doesn't know 1, so 1 is not a celebrity

- 2 knows 1, but 1 knows 2, so 2 is not a celebrity

Therefore, return -1.

Alright, so I need to find someone who doesn't know anyone else, but everyone else knows them.

A brute-force approach would be to check for each person whether they know anyone else and whether everyone else knows them. But that would be O(n^2), which might not be efficient, especially since the follow-up mentions a constraint of 3n calls to ""knows.""

I need a smarter way to reduce the number of calls.

Let's think about it step by step.

I can iterate through each person and try to eliminate them as potential celebrities.

Start with a candidate, say person 0.

Check if this candidate knows the next person, person 1.

- If candidate knows person 1, then the candidate can't be a celebrity because a celebrity doesn't know anyone. So, eliminate this candidate and make person 1 the new candidate.

- If candidate doesn't know person 1, then person 1 can't be a celebrity because the candidate doesn't know them, but for person 1 to be a celebrity, everyone should know them. So, eliminate person 1 and keep the candidate as is.

Continue this process until you have one candidate left.

Then, verify if this candidate is indeed a celebrity by checking:

- That the candidate doesn't know anyone else.

- That everyone else knows the candidate.

This way, you're reducing the number of calls significantly.

Let me try to formalize this:

1. Initialize a variable ""candidate"" to 0.

2. For i from 1 to n-1:

a. If candidate knows i, set candidate to i.

3. After the loop, candidate is the potential celebrity.

4. Verify:

a. For every person from 0 to n-1:

- If person!= candidate, check if person knows candidate and candidate does not know person.

- If any person doesn't satisfy this, return -1.

5. If all satisfy, return candidate.

This seems efficient because the first loop is O(n), and the verification is also O(n).

So total calls to knows() are O(n), which is better than O(n^2).

Let me test this logic with the first example:

graph = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]

n = 3

Initialize candidate = 0

i=1:

knows(0,1) = 1 (true), so candidate = 1

i=2:

knows(1,2) = 0 (false), so keep candidate = 1

Now, verify:

For person 0:

- 0 knows 1 (true)

- 1 does not know 0 (true)

For person 2:

- 2 knows 1 (true)

- 1 does not know 2 (true)

So, 1 is the celebrity.

Good.

Second example:

graph = [[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]

n=3

candidate=0

i=1:

knows(0,1)=0 (false), so keep candidate=0

i=2:

knows(0,2)=1 (true), so candidate=2

Now, verify:

For person 0:

- 0 knows 2 (true)

- 2 does not know 0 (false, but 2 knows 0 in this graph)

Wait, graph[2][0] = 0, which means 2 does not know 0.

Wait, but in the graph:

graph = [[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]

So, graph[2][0] = 0, meaning 2 does not know 0.

But in the earlier analysis, I thought 2 knows 0.

Wait, actually, graph[2][0] = 0, meaning 2 does not know 0.

But in the earlier step, when verifying candidate=2:

For person 0:

- 0 knows 2 (true)

- 2 does not know 0 (true, since graph[2][0]=0)

Wait, but in the second example, there is no celebrity, but according to this, it seems candidate=2 passes the verification.

Wait, but in the second example, there is no celebrity.

Wait, perhaps I misanalyzed the second example.

Let's re-examine the second example:

graph = [[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]

So:

- 0 knows 0 and 2

- 1 knows 0 and 1

- 2 knows 1 and 2

Is there a celebrity here?

- 0 knows 2, so if 2 is a celebrity, 0 should know 2, which is true.

- But 2 knows 1, which means 2 is not a celebrity because a celebrity doesn't know anyone.

- 1 knows 0, so 1 is not a celebrity.

- 0 knows 2, but 2 knows 1, which breaks the celebrity condition.

Hence, no celebrity exists.

But according to the algorithm, candidate=2 is selected, and in verification:

- For person 0:

- 0 knows 2 (true)

- 2 does not know 0 (true, since graph[2][0]=0)

- For person 1:

- 1 knows 2 (false, graph[1][2]=0)

- 2 does not know 1 (false, graph[2][1]=1)

Wait, there's inconsistency here.

Wait, verification should check:

- Every other person knows the candidate.

- The candidate does not know any other person.

So, for candidate=2:

- Check if person 0 knows 2: yes.

- Check if person 1 knows 2: no, which is a problem.

- Check if candidate 2 does not know person 0: yes, graph[2][0]=0.

- Check if candidate 2 does not know person 1: no, graph[2][1]=1, which is a problem.

So, the verification should fail for candidate=2, hence returning -1, which is correct.

I must have missteped earlier.

Therefore, this approach seems correct.

Now, implement this in code.

I need to implement a function findCelebrity(n), which uses a helper function knows(a, b).

Also, there is an implicit graph representation, but in code, knows(a, b) is provided.

I need to make sure not to exceed the API call limits.

Implement the algorithm as described.

First, find a candidate by iterating through the list and eliminating those who know others.

Then, verify the candidate by checking the definitions of a celebrity.

If verification passes, return the candidate; else, return -1.

Let me sketch the code structure.

Define a function findCelebrity(n):

Initialize candidate = 0

For i from 1 to n-1:

if knows(candidate, i):

candidate = i

# Now candidate is potential celebrity

# Verify

for i in range(n):

if i == candidate:

continue

if not knows(i, candidate) or knows(candidate, i):

return -1

return candidate

This should work.

But, to make it more efficient, I can combine some checks.

Also, in the verification step, I can check both conditions simultaneously to minimize calls to knows().

Wait, but knows() is allowed to be called multiple times.

But to optimize, I can check both conditions in one call if possible.

Wait, but knows(a, b) only tells if a knows b.

So, to check if i knows candidate and candidate does not know i, I need two calls: knows(i, candidate) and knows(candidate, i).

There's no way to combine them into one call.

Hence, the verification step will take O(n) calls.

The initial candidate finding step takes O(n) calls.

So overall, it's O(n).

Which should be acceptable.

Let me consider the constraints.

n can be from 2 to 100.

knows(a, b) returns true if a knows b, else false.

graph[i][i] = 1 for all i.

There is exactly one celebrity or none.

In the problem statement, it's guaranteed that there is exactly one celebrity if present.

I need to implement API calls efficiently.

I should also consider that knows() might have some constraints on the number of calls, but in this approach, it's optimized.

Let me think about possible edge cases.

Edge case 1: n=2.

- If person 0 knows person 1 and person 1 doesn't know anyone, then person 1 is celebrity.

- If both know each other, no celebrity.

Edge case 2: n=1.

- But n >=2, as per constraints.

Edge case 3: When the celebrity knows themselves.

- But according to the problem, everyone knows themselves, so graph[i][i]=1.

Edge case 4: When there is no celebrity.

- Need to make sure the verification fails correctly.

Edge case 5: When there is a celebrity, and everyone knows them, and the celebrity doesn't know anyone else.

I need to make sure the candidate finding step correctly identifies the celebrity.

Also, ensure that the verification step correctly validates the candidate.

I should also consider the possibility of multiple celebrities, but according to the problem, there is exactly one celebrity or none.

Hence, no need to handle multiple celebrities.

Now, proceed to implement the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to identify a celebrity in a room of `n` people, where a celebrity is defined as someone who is known by everyone else but knows no one. We are given a helper function `knows(a, b)` that returns whether person `a` knows person `b`. Our task is to find the celebrity using as few calls to `knows` as possible.

### Approach

1. **Initial Candidate Selection**:
   - Start by assuming the first person (person 0) is the celebrity.
   - Iterate through each person, and if the current candidate knows another person, eliminate the candidate and consider the other person as the new candidate.
   - This step helps us narrow down the potential celebrity with minimal calls to `knows`.

2. **Verification**:
   - After identifying a potential candidate, verify two things:
     - The candidate does not know anyone else.
     - Everyone else knows the candidate.
   - If both conditions hold true, the candidate is the celebrity; otherwise, there is no celebrity.

This approach ensures that we make efficient use of the `knows` function by minimizing its calls.

    The algorithm used here is a binary search approach which starts with the range from the first to the last version. In each iteration, it takes the middle point and checks if it's a bad version by calling `isBadVersion()` API.

If the middle version is bad, this means that the first bad version is either the middle version or somewhere on the left side of the range. So, we update the right end of the range to the middle version.

If the middle version is not bad, the first bad version must be somewhere on the right side of the range. So, we update the left end of the range to the middle version + 1.

The loop will continue until the left and right pointers converge, indicating that we have found the first bad version. As a result, we return the value of the left pointer.

This algorithm has a complexity of O(log n), as it reduces the search range by half at each iteration hence minimizing the number of calls to the API.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, a binary search approach is ideal. Here's why:

1. **Sorted Nature**: The versions are linearly ordered from 1 to n.

Binary search allows us to efficiently narrow down the search space by half at each step, which is perfect for this scenario.

**Follow up:** Could you solve the problem in `O(n)` time complexity? Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","So I've got this problem here where I need to reorder an array such that `nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3]...` and so on. Basically, it's about making the array alternate between smaller and larger elements. The problem says that there's always a valid answer for the given input, which is good because it means I don't have to worry about invalid cases.

First, I need to understand what this pattern means. It means that every even-indexed element should be less than or equal to its next odd-indexed element, and every odd-indexed element should be greater than or equal to its next even-indexed element. So, in other words, elements at even indices are local minima, and elements at odd indices are local maxima.

Let me look at the first example:

Input: nums = [3,5,2,1,6,4]

One possible output is [3,5,1,6,2,4], where 3 <= 5 >= 1 <= 6 >= 2 <= 4.

Another accepted output is [1,6,2,5,3,4], where 1 <= 6 >= 2 <= 5 >= 3 <= 4.

So, there can be multiple correct reorderings, as long as they satisfy the condition.

The second example is:

Input: nums = [6,6,5,6,3,8]

Output: [6,6,5,6,3,8]

Here, 6 <= 6 >= 5 <= 6 >= 3 <= 8, which satisfies the condition.

Now, I need to think about how to achieve this rearrangement.

One straightforward way is to sort the array and then rearrange it to fit the pattern. But I need to see if there's a better way, especially considering the follow-up question about O(n) time complexity.

Let me think about the properties of the desired arrangement. At each step, for even indices, I want a local minimum, and for odd indices, a local maximum.

Wait, but the problem allows for equality, so it's <= and >=, not just < and >.

One approach could be to iterate through the array and swap elements to satisfy the condition at each pair of indices.

For example, starting from index 0, I ensure that nums[0] <= nums[1]. If not, I swap them.

Then, for index 1 and 2, I ensure that nums[1] >= nums[2]. If not, I swap nums[1] and nums[2].

I continue this process for the entire array.

This seems simple and intuitive. Let's see if this works with the first example.

Initial array: [3,5,2,1,6,4]

Start with indices 0 and 1: 3 <= 5, which is true. No swap needed.

Next, indices 1 and 2: 5 >= 2, which is true. No swap needed.

Next, indices 2 and 3: 2 <= 1, which is false. So, swap nums[2] and nums[3]: [3,5,1,2,6,4]

Now, indices 3 and 4: 2 <= 6, which is true.

Indices 4 and 5: 6 >= 4, which is true.

So, the final array is [3,5,1,2,6,4], which satisfies the condition: 3 <= 5 >= 1 <= 2 >= 6 <= 4.

Wait, but in the example, [3,5,1,6,2,4] is given as a correct output, but my method produced [3,5,1,2,6,4]. Both are correct as they satisfy the condition.

So, this swapping approach seems to work.

Let me check it with the second example: [6,6,5,6,3,8]

Start with indices 0 and 1: 6 <= 6, which is true.

Indices 1 and 2: 6 >= 5, which is true.

Indices 2 and 3: 5 <= 6, which is true.

Indices 3 and 4: 6 >= 3, which is true.

Indices 4 and 5: 3 <= 8, which is true.

So, no swaps are needed, and the original array satisfies the condition.

That's good.

Now, let's think about the time complexity. This approach iterates through the array once, checking pairs and swapping if necessary. So, the time complexity is O(n), which is efficient.

But I should consider if there are any edge cases where this approach might fail.

Edge case 1: Array with only two elements.

For example, nums = [1,2]

After rearrangement: 1 <= 2, which is true.

Another example: nums = [2,1]

After swapping: [1,2], which satisfies 1 <= 2.

Edge case 2: Array with all elements equal.

For example, nums = [3,3,3,3]

This satisfies the condition as 3 <= 3 >= 3 <= 3 >= 3 <= 3.

No swaps are needed.

Edge case 3: Array with one element.

Well, it's trivially satisfied since there are no pairs to compare.

Another consideration is that the problem states that it's guaranteed that there will be an answer for the given input, so I don't need to handle cases where it's impossible to rearrange the array to satisfy the condition.

Now, let's think about implementing this approach in code.

I'll need to iterate through the array, considering pairs of indices.

For even indices i:

- Ensure that nums[i] <= nums[i+1]

If not, swap nums[i] and nums[i+1]

For odd indices i:

- Ensure that nums[i] >= nums[i+1]

If not, swap nums[i] and nums[i+1]

Wait, but in terms of code, I can iterate through the array with step 2.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to iterate through the array, and for each index i:

- If i is even, ensure nums[i] <= nums[i+1]

- If i is odd, ensure nums[i] >= nums[i+1]

And swap if the condition is not met.

But I need to make sure that I don't go out of bounds, so I need to iterate up to len(nums)-1.

Let me try to write a small pseudocode:

for i in 0 to len(nums)-2:

if i % 2 == 0:

if nums[i] > nums[i+1]:

swap nums[i] and nums[i+1]

else:

if nums[i] < nums[i+1]:

swap nums[i] and nums[i+1]

Wait, but in the else case, i is odd.

So, for even i, ensure nums[i] <= nums[i+1]

For odd i, ensure nums[i] >= nums[i+1]

Yes, that makes sense.

Let me test this pseudocode with the first example:

Initial array: [3,5,2,1,6,4]

i=0 (even): 3 <= 5 -> true, no swap

i=1 (odd): 5 >= 2 -> true, no swap

i=2 (even): 2 <= 1 -> false, swap 2 and 1 -> [3,5,1,2,6,4]

i=3 (odd): 2 >= 6 -> false, swap 2 and 6 -> [3,5,1,6,2,4]

i=4 (even): 2 <= 4 -> true, no swap

Final array: [3,5,1,6,2,4], which matches the example.

Good.

Another test with the second example:

[6,6,5,6,3,8]

i=0 (even): 6 <= 6 -> true

i=1 (odd): 6 >= 5 -> true

i=2 (even): 5 <= 6 -> true

i=3 (odd): 6 >= 3 -> true

i=4 (even): 3 <= 8 -> true

No swaps needed, which is correct.

Seems solid.

Now, think about the time complexity. Since I'm iterating through the array once, and each iteration involves constant time operations, the time complexity is O(n), which is efficient and meets the follow-up requirement.

Space complexity is O(1), since I'm rearranging the array in place.

I should also consider if there are any constraints on the swaps or if the array needs to be fully sorted. But according to the problem, as long as the condition is satisfied, it's acceptable.

Another thing to note is that the problem says ""It is guaranteed that there will be an answer for the given input nums."" So, I don't need to handle cases where it's impossible to achieve the desired arrangement.

I think this approach is straightforward and efficient.

Let me consider if there are any other approaches or optimizations possible.

One alternative approach could be to sort the array and then rearrange it by placing the smallest elements in even indices and the largest in odd indices. But this might not be necessary, as the swapping approach already works and is more efficient.

For example, sorting the array [3,5,2,1,6,4] gives [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Then, placing the smallest elements in even indices and largest in odd indices could give [1,6,2,5,3,4], which is also a valid output.

But this approach would have a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting, which is worse than the O(n) swapping approach.

Therefore, the swapping approach is preferable.

Let me see if there are any possible improvements or optimizations to the swapping approach.

Well, since it's already O(n), and simple to implement, I think it's optimal for this problem.

I should also consider if multiple passes are needed. In the swapping approach, I'm making one pass through the array, ensuring the condition for each pair.

Is it possible that one pass is not enough? Let's see.

Consider the array [4,2,3,1].

Initial array: [4,2,3,1]

i=0 (even): 4 <= 2 -> false, swap to get [2,4,3,1]

i=1 (odd): 4 >= 3 -> true

i=2 (even): 3 <= 1 -> false, swap to get [2,4,1,3]

Now, check the final array: 2 <= 4 >= 1 <= 3, which satisfies the condition.

Another example: [1,3,2]

i=0 (even): 1 <= 3 -> true

i=1 (odd): 3 >= 2 -> true

So, no swaps needed.

Seems like one pass is sufficient.

But let's consider a more complex example: [5,4,3,2,1]

Initial array: [5,4,3,2,1]

i=0 (even): 5 <= 4 -> false, swap to get [4,5,3,2,1]

i=1 (odd): 5 >= 3 -> true

i=2 (even): 3 <= 2 -> false, swap to get [4,5,2,3,1]

i=3 (odd): 3 >= 1 -> true

Final array: 4 <= 5 >= 2 <= 3 >= 1, which satisfies the condition.

Good.

I don't think multiple passes are necessary, as the swapping approach seems to work in one pass.

Therefore, I'll proceed with implementing this swapping approach in Python.

In terms of code, I need to iterate through the array up to len(nums)-1, check the index parity, and perform swaps if necessary.

I need to make sure to handle the case where i is even or odd correctly.

Also, since the problem mentions that the input array always has a valid answer, I don't need to handle cases where it's impossible to satisfy the condition.

Finally, I need to make sure that the function modifies the array in place, as specified.

Let me proceed to write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to reorder the array such that `nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3]...`. The approach involves iterating through the array and swapping adjacent elements to ensure that each pair of elements satisfies the required condition based on their indices.

### Approach
1. **Intuition**: We need to arrange the array such that elements at even indices are less than or equal to their next elements, and elements at odd indices are greater than or equal to their next elements.
2. **Algorithm**:
   - Iterate through the array from the first element to the second-to-last element.
   - For each index `i`:
     - If `i` is even and `nums[i] > nums[i+1]`, swap `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]`.
     - If `i` is odd and `nums[i] < nums[i+1]`, swap `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]`.
3. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n) because we are making a single pass through the array.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are rearranging the array in place.

The iterator should provide the `next` and `hasNext` methods to retrieve elements in an alternating fashion until all elements from both vectors have been consumed.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We will maintain two pointers, one for each vector, to track the current position in each vector.
   - We will also keep track of which vector to take the next element from, starting with the first vector.

2. ** hasNext Method**:
   - This method should return `True` if there are elements remaining in at least one of the vectors, and `False` otherwise.

3. ** next Method**:
   - This method should return the next element in the alternating sequence.
   - It should alternate between the two vectors, taking one element from each vector in turn.
   - If one vector is exhausted before the other, it should continue taking elements from the non-exhausted vector.

4. **Extension to k Vectors**:
   - For the follow-up question, where we have `k` vectors, we can generalize the approach by maintaining a list of vectors and a pointer for each vector.
   - We can iterate through the vectors in a cyclic manner, taking one element from each vector in sequence, skipping any vector that has been exhausted.

    The algorithm is based on a backtracking approach. We initialize a helper function with the initial parameters, such as the starting position, expression, and running sum. The helper function is then called recursively for each possible operator insertion. When the position reaches the end of the input string, we check if the running sum equals the target. If it does, we add the current expression to the result.

We use these parameters in the helper function:

- `pos`: The current position in the input string
- `currVal`: The current value of the expression up until this point
- `prevVal`: The value before the last operator we inserted
- `currExpr`: The expression string that we are building up

To avoid leading zeros in operands, we use a check to terminate the loop if we encounter a zero at the start.

Inside the helper function, we iterate over the possible next positions ('i') in the input string and decide which operation to perform at the current position:

1. Base case: When the current position is 0, we simply update the current value and expression with no operator.
2. Addition: We update the current value by adding the parsed value, and append ""+"" followed by the substring to the expression.
3. Subtraction: We update the current value by subtracting the parsed value, and append ""-"" followed by the substring to the expression.
4. Multiplication: We update the current value by first subtracting the previous value, then adding the product of the previous value and the parsed value, and append ""*"" followed by the substring to the expression.

After the helper function iterates through all possibilities, we return the result as a list of expressions that evaluate to the target value.

So, the task is to insert binary operators ('+', '-', '*') between the digits of a given string `num` in such a way that the resulting expression evaluates to a given `target` value. The constraints include not having leading zeros in any of the operands.

First, I need to understand the problem fully. We have a string of digits, and we can insert operators between them. The operators allowed are addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The goal is to find all possible expressions that evaluate to the target value.

Let's look at the examples provided:

1. For `num = ""123""`, `target = 6`, the outputs are `""1*2*3""` and `""1+2+3""`. Both expressions evaluate to 6.

2. For `num = ""232""`, `target = 8`, the outputs are `""2*3+2""` and `""2+3*2""`. Both evaluate to 8.

3. For `num = ""3456237490""`, `target = 9191`, there are no valid expressions, hence an empty list.

From these, I can see that the operators can be placed in different combinations between the digits, and the expressions are evaluated according to the usual operator precedence (multiplication before addition and subtraction).

I need to generate all possible expressions by inserting these operators between the digits and then evaluate them to see if they equal the target.

Given that the string can be up to 10 characters long, and each position between digits can have one of three operators or none (but we have to consider the operands correctly), the number of possible expressions could be quite large. So, efficiency is key here.

I think a backtracking approach would be suitable for this problem. Backtracking allows us to explore all possible combinations in a systematic way, and we can prune branches that won't lead to a solution, which might help in reducing the computation time.

Let me outline the steps for the backtracking approach:

1. **Choose a starting point:** Begin with the first digit of the string.

2. **Decision points:** At each step, decide whether to insert an operator after the current digit or to consider combining it with the next digit as part of the same operand.

3. **Constraints:** Ensure that no operand has leading zeros unless it is zero itself.

4. **Goal:** Build expressions and evaluate them to see if they equal the target.

But evaluating expressions at each step can be inefficient, especially since the string can be up to 10 digits long, leading to many possible expressions. To optimize, I should evaluate the expression as I build it, keeping track of the running total.

I recall that in similar problems, keeping track of the left-hand side (LHS) and the current operation can help in calculating the total efficiently.

Wait, but in this case, we have to handle operator precedence, especially for multiplication, which has higher precedence than addition and subtraction.

Maybe I need to keep track of the operations in a way that respects this precedence.

Let me think about how expressions are evaluated.

For example, in `""2+3*2""`, the multiplication is done first, so `3*2` is 6, then `2+6` is 8.

Similarly, in `""2*3+2""`, `2*3` is 6, then `6+2` is 8.

So, I need to handle the multiplication operations before addition and subtraction.

This sounds like I need to keep track of the operations in the order they should be applied, considering the precedence.

Perhaps I can keep track of the current value and the operand and operator separately.

I remember a similar problem where we had to build an expression and keep track of the accumulated total, the last operand, and the last operator to handle precedence.

Let me try to recall that.

In that approach, we keep track of the following variables:

- `total`: The total sum so far.

- `last_operand`: The last number that was multiplied (since multiplication has higher precedence).

- `last_operator`: The last operator encountered.

When we encounter a new digit or a sequence of digits, we can decide to:

- Add it to the current operand.

- Or, finalize the current operand and apply the operator.

But in this problem, we are inserting operators between digits, so the operands are the digits themselves or sequences of digits without operators in between.

Wait, no. We can have sequences of digits forming a single operand if we don't insert an operator between them.

For example, in `""123""`, if we don't insert any operators, it's `""123""`, which is 123.

If we insert '+' between 1 and 2, and between 2 and 3, it's `""1+2+3""`.

If we insert '*' between 1 and 2, and between 2 and 3, it's `""1*2*3""`.

So, the operands can be multiple digits if we don't insert operators between them.

Therefore, I need to decide at each position between digits whether to insert an operator or not.

Moreover, I need to handle the case where operands do not have leading zeros, except for zero itself.

So, if a operand is ""0"", it's allowed, but ""01"" is not allowed.

Given that, I need to be careful when forming operands to ensure they don't have leading zeros.

Now, let's think about the backtracking function.

I'll define a backtracking function that takes the current index in the string, the current expression built so far, and the evaluated value of the expression up to the current index.

Wait, but evaluating the expression at each step might be too slow if done naively.

Instead, I should keep track of the running total and handle the operations as I go.

Let me try to define the backtracking function with the following parameters:

- `index`: The current position in the string `num`.

- `path`: The current expression string built so far.

- `total`: The total value of the expression up to the current operator.

- `last_operand`: The last operand that was added to the total.

- `expression`: The string representation of the expression built so far.

Wait, I need to keep track of the expression string to return the valid ones.

But also, to handle the operator precedence, I need to manage the total and the last operand appropriately.

Let me recall the approach from the ""Basic Calculator IV"" problem or similar problems where we handle different operators with precedence.

In those problems, we use a stack or keep track of the operations and operands in a way that respects precedence.

But in this problem, since we have only three operators ('+', '-', '*'), and '*' has higher precedence than '+' and '-', I need to handle multiplication operations by considering their impact on the total.

Wait, perhaps I can treat the expression as if it's being evaluated from left to right, considering the precedence of multiplication.

But that might be too simplistic.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I build the expression step by step, and at each step, I decide whether to insert an operator after the current digit or to extend the current operand by including the next digit.

For example, for ""123"":

- Start with ""1"", then decide to insert '+', '-', '*' or nothing before '2'.

- If I insert an operator, then ""1 op 2"", and then decide what to do with '3'.

- If I choose nothing between '1' and '2', then it becomes ""12"", and then decide what to do with '3'.

This seems manageable.

But I need a way to evaluate the expression as I build it to keep track of the total.

Perhaps I can maintain the total and the last known operand and operator to handle the additions, subtractions, and multiplications.

Let me try to define the backtracking function with the following parameters:

- `index`: The current position in the string `num`.

- `expression`: The current expression string.

- `total`: The total value of the expression up to the current operator.

- `last_operand`: The last operand that was added to the total.

- `operator`: The operator to be applied to `last_operand` and the next operand.

Wait, maybe I need to keep track of the operator to be applied to the next operand.

I need to carefully manage the operators and operands to handle the precedence correctly.

Let me look for a standard approach to building and evaluating expressions with operators of different precedence.

I recall that in some expression evaluation problems, we use the shunting yard algorithm or evaluate expressions by keeping track of the operations.

But in this case, since we are building the expressions and evaluating them, I need a way to handle the operations in the correct order.

Perhaps I can maintain the total and the last operand, and based on the operator, decide how to update the total.

For example:

- When encountering '+', add the last_operand to the total, and set last_operand to the new operand.

- When encountering '-', subtract the last_operand from the total, and set last_operand to the new operand.

- When encountering '*', multiply the last_operand by the new operand, and update the total accordingly.

Wait, but this doesn't fully account for the precedence of multiplication over addition and subtraction.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I keep track of the total and the temporary product separately.

Whenever I encounter a multiplication, I multiply it with the temporary product.

When I encounter addition or subtraction, I add or subtract the temporary product to the total and start a new temporary product.

But I need to think carefully about how to implement this.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define the backtracking function with:

- `index`: current position in `num`.

- `expression`: current expression string.

- `total`: the evaluated value of the expression up to the current operator.

- `temp_product`: the value of the current multiplication block.

- `last_operand`: the last operand that was part of the temp_product.

At each step, I can:

- If this is the first operand, set `total` to its value.

- Otherwise, based on the operator, update `total` and `temp_product` accordingly.

But I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some expression building problems, we can use recursion to build parts of the expression and combine them.

For example, we can split the string at each possible position, evaluate the left and right parts separately, and then combine them with the operators.

But with the constraints of operator precedence, this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of dividing the expression into parts where multiplications are grouped, and then summing or subtracting those groups.

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider a different strategy.

Since the string can be up to 10 characters long, and at each position between digits, I can choose to insert one of the three operators or nothing (but nothing means combining digits into a single operand), the total number of possibilities is manageable.

Given that, perhaps it's acceptable to generate all possible expressions and evaluate them, although it might not be the most efficient approach.

But considering the time constraints, I should try to optimize it as much as possible.

Let me think about how to generate all possible expressions.

I can think of it as deciding at each position between digits whether to insert '+', '-', '*', or nothing.

But if I choose nothing, I must combine the current digit with the previous one, forming a single operand.

However, I need to ensure that operands do not have leading zeros unless the operand is zero itself.

So, I need to be careful when forming operands to avoid leading zeros.

Given that, I need to track the starting digit of each operand to ensure it doesn't have leading zeros.

Now, let's try to define the backtracking function.

I'll define a function `backtrack(index, path, value, last_operand)` where:

- `index` is the current position in the string `num`.

- `path` is the current expression string.

- `value` is the current evaluated value of the expression.

- `last_operand` is the value of the last operand that can be used for multiplication.

This seems similar to some approaches I've seen before.

Wait, but I need to handle the operators and their precedence correctly.

Let me try to define it more carefully.

I need to keep track of the total value and the last operand to handle multiplication correctly.

Here's an idea:

- Start with the first digit as the first operand.

- At each step, for the remaining string, decide whether to:

  - Insert '+' and then continue with the next operand.

  - Insert '-' and then continue with the next operand.

  - Insert '*' and then continue with the next operand.

  - Do nothing, which means extending the current operand by one more digit.

- When inserting an operator, evaluate its effect on the total based on the operator precedence.

- Keep track of the total and the last operand affected by multiplication.

But I need a concrete way to manage this.

Let me look for a standard approach to handle operator precedence in expression building.

After some research, I found that in some expression building problems, people use the concept of ""mul_val"" to handle the multiplication operations separately from addition and subtraction.

The idea is to keep track of the multiplication stack separately and then combine them with addition and subtraction.

But this seems a bit complex.

Let me try to simplify it.

Suppose I have a running total and a temporary multiplication value.

Whenever I encounter a multiplication, I multiply it with the temporary multiplication value.

When I encounter addition or subtraction, I add or subtract the temporary multiplication value to the total and reset it.

But I need to handle the signs correctly.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the sign for each operand.

Let me try to define the backtracking function with the following parameters:

- `index`: current position in `num`.

- `expression`: current expression string.

- `total`: the evaluated value of the expression up to the current operator.

- `mul_val`: the value of the current multiplication block.

- `sign`: the sign of the next operand (+1 or -1).

At each step, I can:

- If this is the first operand, set `total` to its value multiplied by `sign`.

- Otherwise, based on the operator, update `total` and `mul_val` accordingly.

But I'm still a bit confused.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some expression building problems, people use the concept of dividing the expression into parts where multiplications are grouped, and then summing or subtracting those groups.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I split the string into two parts at position `i`, and recursively find all possible expressions for each part, then combine them with the operators.

But this might lead to redundant computations and is not efficient.

Given the time constraints, I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider building the expression step by step, keeping track of the evaluated value at each step.

I can use a list to store the current expression string and the evaluated value.

At each step, I can decide to:

- Insert '+' after the current digit.

- Insert '-' after the current digit.

- Insert '*' after the current digit.

- Do nothing, which means combining the current digit with the previous digits as part of the same operand.

For each decision, I'll update the expression string and the evaluated value accordingly.

I need to ensure that operands do not have leading zeros.

This seems manageable.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Initialize a list of tuples, where each tuple contains:

   - The current expression string.

   - The current evaluated total.

   - The last operand in the expression.

2. Start with the first digit:

   - If the first digit is '0', then the first operand is '0'. (Special case for single zero)

   - Otherwise, consider all possible operands starting from the first digit without leading zeros.

3. For each possible operand starting from the current index:

   - If the operand has leading zeros and its length is more than 1, skip it.

   - Otherwise, for each expression in the current list, create new expressions by inserting '+', '-', or '*' with the current operand.

   - For each new expression, evaluate the new total based on the operator and the last operand.

4. Repeat this process until all digits are used.

5. Collect the expressions where the total equals the target.

This seems like a feasible approach.

Let me try to implement this step by step.

First, I need to handle the special case for the first operand.

If the string starts with '0', the first operand can only be '0'. If it's '0' followed by other digits, it's invalid.

Wait, no. If the string starts with '0', and the second digit is not zero, then ""0"" is the first operand, and the rest can be handled separately.

But I need to ensure that operands do not have leading zeros.

So, for each operand, if it starts with '0', its length must be 1.

Otherwise, it can have multiple digits without leading zeros.

Given that, I can iterate through the string and for each position, decide whether to split the string into operands.

Now, let's think about the implementation.

I'll initialize a list to hold tuples of (expression string, total, last_operand).

At the beginning, before any operations, the list is empty.

Start with the first digit:

- If it's '0', then the first operand is '0'.

- Otherwise, consider all possible operands starting from the first digit without leading zeros.

For each possible first operand, add it to the list with the expression being the operand itself, the total being its value, and the last_operand being its value.

Then, for each subsequent digit, for each expression in the current list, consider the possible operations:

- Insert '+' followed by the new operand.

- Insert '-' followed by the new operand.

- Insert '*' followed by the new operand.

- Combine the current operand with the next digit (if no leading zero).

For each of these operations, update the expression string and the total accordingly.

Specifically:

- For '+', add the new operand to the total.

- For '-', subtract the new operand from the total.

- For '*', multiply the last_operand by the new operand and adjust the total accordingly.

- For combining digits, update the last operand by appending the next digit.

Wait, but combining digits is similar to not inserting any operator, which means the operand is extended by the next digit.

I need to handle this carefully.

Let me try to formalize the steps.

Initialize a list `expressions`, which is a list of tuples: (current_expression_string, total, last_operand).

Start with the first digit:

- If it's '0', then add ('0', 0, 0) to `expressions`.

- Otherwise, for each possible operand starting from the first digit without leading zeros, add (operand_str, int(operand_str), int(operand_str)) to `expressions`.

Then, for each subsequent digit:

- For each expression in `expressions`:

  - For each possible operand starting from the current index without leading zeros:

    - For each operator in ['+', '-', '*']:

      - Create a new expression by appending "" operator operand"" to the current expression.

      - Update the total based on the operator:

        - If '+', total += operand.

        - If '-', total -= operand.

        - If '*', total = (total - last_operand) + (last_operand * operand).

      - Set the last_operand to the operand if the operator is '+' or '-', else set it to (last_operand * operand).

    - Also, consider combining the current digit with the last operand (if no leading zero):

      - Update the last_operand by appending the current digit.

      - Update the total accordingly.

This seems complex, but it should work.

I need to be careful with the multiplication operation because it has higher precedence than addition and subtraction.

When multiplying, I need to adjust the total by subtracting the last_operand and then adding the product of last_operand and the new operand.

Wait, no. Actually, when multiplying, it's like the multiplication operation is applied to the last_operand and the new operand, and then that result is added to the total.

But that might not be accurate.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I keep track of the total and the pending multiplication.

Wait, perhaps it's better to treat the expression as a sum of products, where multiplications are grouped and then added or subtracted.

In that case, I can keep track of the current addition or subtraction total, and a separate multiplication value that is multiplied with the next operand.

But this is getting too convoluted.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some expression building problems, people use the concept of dividing the expression into parts where multiplications are handled separately.

But I need a more straightforward approach.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I can generate all possible expressions and evaluate them, although it's not the most efficient way.

But considering that the string can be up to 10 characters long, and with operators inserted between digits, the number of possible expressions is manageable.

Let me calculate the number of possible expressions.

For a string of length n, there are (n-1) positions where operators can be inserted.

At each position, there are 4 choices: '+', '-', '*', or no operator (concatenate digits).

So, the total number of possible expressions is 4^(n-1).

For n=10, that's 4^9 = 262144, which is manageable for a computer.

Given that, perhaps it's acceptable to generate all possible expressions and evaluate them.

But I need to ensure that operands do not have leading zeros.

So, I need to generate all possible expressions by inserting operators in the allowed positions and ensuring that operands don't have leading zeros.

Then, evaluate each expression and collect those that equal the target.

To make this efficient, I can generate the expressions on the fly and evaluate them simultaneously, pruning branches that exceed the target.

But even better, I can use a recursive approach to build the expression and keep track of the evaluated value at each step.

This way, I can avoid generating full expressions and evaluating them at the end, which would be inefficient.

So, I'll proceed with a recursive backtracking approach where I build the expression and keep track of the total and the last operand.

I'll define a recursive function that takes the current index, the current expression string, the current total, and the last operand.

At each step, I can decide to:

- Insert '+' followed by the next operand.

- Insert '-' followed by the next operand.

- Insert '*' followed by the next operand.

- Combine the next digit with the current operand (if no leading zero).

This way, I can build the expression step by step, updating the total and last operand accordingly.

I need to handle the multiplication correctly by adjusting the total when a multiplication is encountered.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define the recursive function `backtrack(index, expression, total, last_operand)`.

Base case:

- If `index` == len(num), check if `total` == target. If yes, add `expression` to the result list.

Recursive case:

- For each possible operand starting from `index`:

  - If the operand has leading zeros and its length is greater than 1, skip it.

  - Else:

    - If this is the first operand:

      - Set `total` = operand.

      - Set `last_operand` = operand.

      - Recurse with index updated to the end of this operand, expression = operand, total = operand, last_operand = operand.

    - Else:

      - For each operator in ['+', '-', '*']:

        - If '+':

          - New total = total + operand.

          - New last_operand = operand.

          - Recurse with updated index, expression + '+' + operand, new total, new last_operand.

        - If '-':

          - New total = total - operand.

          - New last_operand = -operand.

          - Recurse with updated index, expression + '-' + operand, new total, new last_operand.

        - If '*':

          - New total = (total - last_operand) + (last_operand * operand).

          - New last_operand = last_operand * operand.

          - Recurse with updated index, expression + '*' + operand, new total, new last_operand.

This seems like it could work.

The key is handling the multiplication correctly by adjusting the total to account for the multiplication's precedence over addition and subtraction.

Let me test this logic with an example.

Take `num = ""123""`, `target = 6`.

Start with index=0, expression="""", total=0, last_operand=0.

First, choose operand ""1"" (index=0 to 0):

- Since it's the first operand, set total=1, last_operand=1.

- Recurse with index=1, expression=""1"", total=1, last_operand=1.

At index=1:

- Choose operand ""2"" (index=1 to 1):

  - For '+': total=1+2=3, last_operand=2 -> expression=""1+2""

  - For '-': total=1-2=-1, last_operand=-2 -> expression=""1-2""

  - For '*': total=(1-1)+(1*2)=0+2=2, last_operand=2 -> expression=""1*2""

- Choose operand ""23"" (index=1 to 2):

  - For '+': total=1+23=24, last_operand=23 -> expression=""1+23""

  - For '-': total=1-23=-22, last_operand=-23 -> expression=""1-23""

  - For '*': total=(1-1)+(1*23)=0+23=23, last_operand=23 -> expression=""1*23""

At index=2:

- For ""1+2"", total=3:

  - Choose operand ""3"" (index=2 to 2):

    - For '+': total=3+3=6, last_operand=3 -> expression=""1+2+3""

    - For '-': total=3-3=0, last_operand=-3 -> expression=""1+2-3""

    - For '*': total=(3-2)+(2*3)=1+6=7, last_operand=6 -> expression=""1+2*3""

- For ""1-2"", total=-1:

  - Choose operand ""3"" (index=2 to 2):

    - For '+': total=-1+3=2, last_operand=3 -> expression=""1-2+3""

    - For '-': total=-1-3=-4, last_operand=-3 -> expression=""1-2-3""

    - For '*': total=(-1 - (-2)) + (-2*3)=1 + (-6)=-5, last_operand=-6 -> expression=""1-2*3""

- For ""1*2"", total=2:

  - Choose operand ""3"" (index=2 to 2):

    - For '+': total=2+3=5, last_operand=3 -> expression=""1*2+3""

    - For '-': total=2-3=-1, last_operand=-3 -> expression=""1*2-3""

    - For '*': total=(2-2)+(2*3)=0+6=6, last_operand=6 -> expression=""1*2*3""

- For ""1+23"", total=24:

  - Choose operand ""3"" (index=2 to 2):

    - For '+': total=24+3=27, last_operand=3 -> expression=""1+23+3""

    - For '-': total=24-3=21, last_operand=-3 -> expression=""1+23-3""

    - For '*': total=(24-23)+(23*3)=1+69=70, last_operand=69 -> expression=""1+23*3""

- For ""1-23"", total=-22:

  - Choose operand ""3"" (index=2 to 2):

    - For '+': total=-22+3=-19, last_operand=3 -> expression=""1-23+3""

    - For '-': total=-22-3=-25, last_operand=-3 -> expression=""1-23-3""

    - For '*': total=(-22 - (-23)) + (-23*3)=1 + (-69)=-68, last_operand=-69 -> expression=""1-23*3""

- For ""1*23"", total=23:

  - Choose operand ""3"" (index=2 to 2):

    - For '+': total=23+3=26, last_operand=3 -> expression=""1*23+3""

    - For '-': total=23-3=20, last_operand=-3 -> expression=""1*23-3""

    - For '*': total=(23 - 23)+(23*3)=0+69=69, last_operand=69 -> expression=""1*23*3""

Now, among these, the expressions that evaluate to 6 are:

- ""1+2+3"" -> 6

- ""1*2*3"" -> 6

Which matches the first example.

Another example: `num = ""232""`, `target = 8`.

Following similar steps, we can see that ""2*3+2"" and ""2+3*2"" evaluate to 8.

This seems to work.

Now, I need to implement this logic in code.

I need to handle the recursion, build the expressions, and manage the total and last_operand correctly.

Also, I need to ensure that operands do not have leading zeros.

To handle that, when forming operands, I need to check if the operand starts with '0' and has more than one digit.

If it does, skip it.

Otherwise, proceed.

I also need to handle the case where the operand is '0' alone, which is allowed.

In code, I'll need to iterate through the string and form possible operands by extending the digit count, checking for leading zeros.

I need to be careful with integer overflows, but since the constraints specify that the target can be from -2^31 to 2^31 -1, and Python handles big integers well, I don't need to worry about that in Python.

Now, let's proceed to implement this approach in Python.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to generate all possible expressions by inserting the binary operators '+', '-', and '*' between the digits of a given string `num` such that the resultant expression evaluates to a given `target` value. We have to ensure that no operand has leading zeros unless it is zero itself.

### Approach
1. **Backtracking**: We use a backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of operators inserted between the digits.
2. **Operator Precedence Handling**: Multiplication has higher precedence than addition and subtraction. We handle this by keeping track of the current total and the last operand.
3. **Pruning**: Skip any operands that have leading zeros unless they are zero themselves.

The hasNext method checks if there are more elements left in the sequence by checking if the internal iterator's next value is not the end.

The in-order successor of a node is the node with the smallest key greater than the node's value. If no such node exists, we should return `null`.

### Approach

1. **Understanding In-Order Traversal**: In an in-order traversal of a BST, nodes are visited in ascending order. Therefore, the in-order successor of a node is the next node in this sequence.

2. **Case 1: Node has a right child**:
   - If the node has a right child, the in-order successor is the leftmost node in its right subtree.
   
3. **Case 2: Node does not have a right child**:
   - Traverse up the tree using the parent pointers until you find a node that is the left child of its parent. The parent of this node is the in-order successor.
   - If no such node is found, the given node is the last node in in-order traversal, hence no successor exists.

Since the problem does not provide parent pointers, we need to simulate the traversal to find the successor.

    The algorithm uses BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the shortest distances from empty rooms to gates. We first create a queue `q` and add all the gates' coordinates to it. Then, we create an array `directions` containing possible moves (up, down, left, right).

While the queue is not empty, we loop through all the gates in the queue, and for each gate, we explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right) and check if they are empty rooms. If they are, we update their distance to be 1 more than the current gate's distance, and add these neighbors to the queue. Once a room's distance is updated, it will not be updated again because that's the shortest distance found. The process continues until all reachable empty rooms have their distances updated.

This algorithm operates in O(m*n) time complexity, where m and n are the dimensions of the grid rooms, since each cell is visited once.

John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","I've got this problem here where I need to fill each empty room in a grid with the distance to its nearest gate. The grid has walls, gates, and empty rooms, and I need to update the empty rooms with their shortest distance to a gate. If a room can't reach a gate, it should stay as INF.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. The grid is represented by a 2D list called `rooms`, where each cell can be one of three things:

- -1: a wall or an obstacle, which can't be passed through.

- 0: a gate, which is the destination we're trying to reach.

- INF (2147483647): an empty room that needs to be updated with the distance to the nearest gate.

My task is to update the `rooms` grid in-place, setting each empty room to its shortest distance to the nearest gate, using the Manhattan distance (since it's a grid, and we can only move up, down, left, or right).

I think the best way to approach this is to use BFS (Breadth-First Search) starting from all the gates simultaneously. This way, I can expand outwards from each gate, updating the distances of the empty rooms level by level. Since BFS explores all directions layer by layer, it ensures that when we reach an empty room, we're doing it through the shortest possible path from any gate.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Identify all gates:** First, I need to find the positions of all gates (cells with value 0) in the grid.

2. **Initialize BFS:** I'll use a queue to manage the cells to be processed. I'll start by adding all gate positions to the queue.

3. **BFS traversal:**

- While the queue is not empty, dequeue a cell.

- For each neighbor (up, down, left, right) of this cell:

- If the neighbor is within bounds and is an empty room (value == INF):

- Calculate the distance to the gate: since we're expanding level by level, the distance is simply the distance of the current cell plus one.

- Update the neighbor's value to this distance.

- Enqueue the neighbor.

4. **Continue until all reachable empty rooms are updated:** The BFS will naturally stop when there are no more cells to process.

This approach should work because BFS guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which is exactly what we need here.

Let me consider the time and space complexity:

- Time Complexity: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. In the worst case, we might need to visit every cell.

- Space Complexity: O(m * n), in the case where all cells are gates or empty rooms, the queue could potentially hold many cells.

Now, let's think about potential edge cases:

- A grid with only one cell, which is a gate.

- A grid with only one cell, which is a wall.

- A grid where all cells are gates.

- A grid where all cells are walls.

- A grid where there are no gates.

- A grid where there are no empty rooms.

- A grid where empty rooms are completely surrounded by walls, making them unreachable.

In the case where there are no gates, the empty rooms should remain as INF since there's nothing to reach them. Similarly, if empty rooms are surrounded by walls, they should remain as INF.

I should also make sure that the code handles empty grids gracefully, but according to the constraints, m and n are at least 1.

Another thing to consider is that when updating the rooms, I need to make sure that I don't overwrite a smaller distance with a larger one, but since BFS expands level by level, starting from gates, and we're updating rooms to their first encountered distance, it should be fine.

I should also ensure that I don't process cells multiple times, but since I'm only enqueuing cells that are empty rooms and marking them by updating their value, they won't be enqueued again.

Let me try to write some pseudocode to visualize this:","def wallsAndGates(rooms):

     For example, ""internationalization"" becomes ""i18n"".

2. **Initialization**:
   - Store the dictionary words and their abbreviations in a way that allows efficient checking for uniqueness.
   - Use a dictionary to map each abbreviation to the set of words that have that abbreviation from the dictionary.

3. **Checking Uniqueness**:
   - Calculate the abbreviation of the given word.
   - Check if this abbreviation exists in the dictionary.
     - If it doesn't exist, the abbreviation is unique.
     - If it exists, check if the only word in the dictionary with this abbreviation is the word itself (case insensitive).

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Rules:**
   - **Under-population:** A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
   - **Stability:** A live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on.
   - **Over-population:** A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
   - **Reproduction:** A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes live.

2. **Simultaneous Update:**
   - We need to update all cells at the same time based on their current state. To achieve this without using extra space, we can use tricked state values:
     - `-1` to represent a cell that was live but is now dead.
     - `2` to represent a cell that was dead but is now live.

3. **Counting Live Neighbors:**
   - For each cell, count the number of its eight neighbors that are live (either currently `1` or previously live now dead `-1`).

4. **Updating the Board:**
   - Apply the rules to each cell to determine its next state.
   - Finally, normalize the board by converting `-1` to `0` and `2` to `1`.

*   All the words in `s` are separated by a **single space**. John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","I've got this problem here. I need to determine if a given string `s` follows a given pattern. The pattern is a sequence of lowercase English letters, and `s` is a string of words separated by spaces. The task is to check if there's a one-to-one mapping between characters in the pattern and words in the string `s`.

First, I need to understand what a bijection means in this context. A bijection is a one-to-one correspondence, meaning each character in the pattern maps to exactly one word in `s`, and each word in `s` maps back to exactly one character in the pattern.

So, for example, if the pattern is ""abba"" and `s` is ""dog cat cat dog"", then 'a' maps to ""dog"", 'b' maps to ""cat"", and the pattern matches the string.

But if `s` is ""dog cat cat fish"", then 'a' maps to ""dog"", 'b' maps to ""cat"", but the last character 'a' would need to map to ""fish"", which conflicts with the earlier mapping to ""dog"". So, this should return False.

Another example is pattern ""aaaa"" and `s` is ""dog cat cat dog"". Here, 'a' would need to map to ""dog"", ""cat"", ""cat"", and ""dog"", which is not possible because 'a' can only map to one unique word. So, this should also return False.

I need to make sure that the number of characters in the pattern matches the number of words in `s`. If they don't, I can immediately return False.

So, first things first, I should split the string `s` into words and check if the number of words matches the length of the pattern.

Let me think about how to implement this.

I can create two dictionaries: one to map from characters in the pattern to words in `s`, and another to map from words in `s` to characters in the pattern. This way, I can ensure that the mapping is bijection.

Here's a rough plan:

1. Split the string `s` into a list of words.

2. Check if the number of words matches the length of the pattern. If not, return False.

3. Initialize two empty dictionaries: one for pattern to word mapping, and one for word to pattern mapping.

4. Iterate through each character in the pattern and each word in the list simultaneously.

   a. For each character and word pair:

      i. Check if the character is already in the pattern dictionary:

         - If it is, and it maps to a different word, return False.

      ii. Check if the word is already in the word dictionary:

         - If it is, and it maps to a different character, return False.

      iii. If neither of the above, add the mappings to both dictionaries.

5. If all pairs match without conflict, return True.

I should also consider edge cases, like:

- Pattern with only one character and one word.

- Pattern with repeated characters and identical words.

- Pattern with unique characters and unique words.

- Pattern longer than the number of words.

- Words that are empty (but according to constraints, s contains only lowercase letters and spaces, with no leading or trailing spaces, and words are separated by a single space, so no empty words).

Wait, the problem says ""s contains only lowercase English letters and spaces''"". Does that mean that words can be single letters or multiple letters, but no numbers or special characters, and no uppercase letters?

Yes, based on the constraints, I can assume that.

Also, ""s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces."" and ""All the words in s are separated by a single space."" So, I can split s on spaces to get the words.

Let me think about how to implement the splitting.

In Python, I can use the split() method, which splits a string into a list of words based on spaces.

For example:

s = ""dog cat cat dog""

words = s.split()

words would be ['dog', 'cat', 'cat', 'dog']

Perfect.

Now, checking the lengths:

if len(pattern)!= len(words):

return False

Then, proceed with the mappings.

Let me consider the first example:

pattern = ""abba""

words = [""dog"", ""cat"", ""cat"", ""dog""]

Initialize two empty dictionaries.

Iterate through:

- pattern[0] = 'a', word[0] = ""dog""

  - 'a' not in pattern_dict, ""dog"" not in word_dict

  - Add pattern_dict['a'] = ""dog"", word_dict[""dog""] = 'a'

- pattern[1] = 'b', word[1] = ""cat""

  - 'b' not in pattern_dict, ""cat"" not in word_dict

  - Add pattern_dict['b'] = ""cat"", word_dict[""cat""] = 'b'

- pattern[2] = 'b', word[2] = ""cat""

  - 'b' is in pattern_dict and pattern_dict['b'] = ""cat"" which matches the current word

  - ""cat"" is in word_dict and word_dict[""cat""] = 'b' which matches the current pattern character

- pattern[3] = 'a', word[3] = ""dog""

  - 'a' is in pattern_dict and pattern_dict['a'] = ""dog"" which matches

  - ""dog"" is in word_dict and word_dict[""dog""] = 'a' which matches

So, it should return True.

Now, second example:

pattern = ""abba""

words = [""dog"", ""cat"", ""cat"", ""fish""]

- 'a' -> ""dog""

- 'b' -> ""cat""

- 'b' -> ""cat""

- 'a' -> ""fish""!= ""dog""

Conflict in pattern_dict, should return False.

Third example:

pattern = ""aaaa""

words = [""dog"", ""cat"", ""cat"", ""dog""]

- 'a' -> ""dog""

- 'a' -> ""cat""!= ""dog""

Conflict, return False.

Another test case:

pattern = ""abc""

words = [""dog"", ""cat"", ""dog""]

- 'a' -> ""dog""

- 'b' -> ""cat""

- 'c' -> ""dog""

But ""dog"" is mapped to both 'a' and 'c', which is not allowed, since it's supposed to be a bijection. So, should return False.

Wait, but according to my initial plan, I'm checking both directions, so it should catch that ""dog"" is already mapped to 'a' when trying to map it to 'c'.

Yes, when processing the last pair:

- 'c' not in pattern_dict, ""dog"" is already in word_dict mapped to 'a'

- So, it should return False.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

pattern = ""a""

words = [""dog""]

- 'a' -> ""dog""

- No conflicts, return True.

Edge case:

pattern = """"

s = """"

- Lengths match, no mappings to check, should return True.

Wait, but according to constraints, pattern.length >= 1, so maybe not.

Wait, looking back at constraints:

- 1 <= pattern.length <= 300

- 1 <= s.length <= 3000

So, pattern and s cannot be empty.

Therefore, I don't need to handle empty strings.

Another edge case:

pattern = ""ab""

words = [""dog"", ""cat"", ""mouse""]

- Lengths don't match, return False.

Or:

pattern = ""abc""

words = [""dog"", ""cat""]

- Lengths don't match, return False.

Ok, seems straightforward.

Let me think about the implementation in code.

In Python, I can do something like:

def wordPattern(pattern, s):

words = s.split()

if len(pattern)!= len(words):

return False

pattern_dict = {}

word_dict = {}

for char, word in zip(pattern, words):

if char in pattern_dict:

if pattern_dict[char]!= word:

return False

elif word in word_dict:

return False

else:

pattern_dict[char] = word

word_dict[word] = char

return True

Wait, in the third example, pattern = ""aaaa"", words = [""dog"", ""cat"", ""cat"", ""dog""], it should return False, but according to this code, it would catch the conflict when mapping 'a' to ""cat"" after already mapping it to ""dog"".

Yes, correct.

Another way could be to use the zip function to pair pattern and words, and then check if the mapping is bijective.

But I think using two dictionaries is a straightforward approach.

Let me check for any possible errors.

What if pattern has repeated characters but words have unique words?

pattern = ""abba""

words = [""dog"", ""cat"", ""mouse"", ""dog""]

- 'a' -> ""dog""

- 'b' -> ""cat""

- 'b' -> ""mouse""!= ""cat""

Conflict, return False

What if pattern has unique characters and words have repeated words?

pattern = ""abcd""

words = [""dog"", ""cat"", ""cat"", ""dog""]

- 'a' -> ""dog""

- 'b' -> ""cat""

- 'c' -> ""cat""!= 'b'

Conflict, return False

Wait, no, 'c' is a different character, but ""cat"" is already mapped to 'b'.

So, when mapping 'c' to ""cat"", it should check if ""cat"" is already in word_dict, which is mapped to 'b', so it should return False.

Yes, correct.

Another way to think about it is that the mapping should be a bijection, so the number of unique characters in pattern should equal the number of unique words in s, and the number of unique mappings should be the same.

Wait, but I think checking with two dictionaries is sufficient.

Alternatively, I can check if the list of characters mapped to words is consistent.

Wait, but I think my initial approach is fine.

Let me see if there's a more Pythonic way.

I saw a solution using zip and set, like:

return len(set(zip(pattern, words))) == len(set(pattern)) == len(set(words))

But this only checks if the pairs are unique and the number of unique characters equals the number of unique words, but it doesn't ensure the bijection properly.

For example, pattern = ""ab"", words = [""dog"", ""dog""]

This would have set(pattern) = {'a', 'b'}, set(words) = {""dog""}, set(zip(pattern, words)) = {('a', 'dog'), ('b', 'dog')}

So, len(set(zip(pattern, words))) = 2, len(set(pattern)) = 2, len(set(words)) = 1

2 == 2 == 1 is False, so it would return False, which is correct.

Another example: pattern = ""abba"", words = [""dog"", ""cat"", ""cat"", ""dog""]

set(pattern) = {'a', 'b'}, set(words) = {""dog"", ""cat""}, set(zip(pattern, words)) = {('a', 'dog'), ('b', 'cat'), ('b', 'cat'), ('a', 'dog')}, so len(set(zip(pattern, words))) = 2, len(set(pattern)) = 2, len(set(words)) = 2, so 2 == 2 == 2 is True.

This seems to work.

Wait, but in my earlier example, pattern = ""abc"", words = [""dog"", ""cat"", ""dog""]

set(pattern) = {'a', 'b', 'c'}, set(words) = {""dog"", ""cat""}, set(zip(pattern, words)) = {('a', 'dog'), ('b', 'cat'), ('c', 'dog')}, so len(set(zip(pattern, words))) = 3, len(set(pattern)) = 3, len(set(words)) = 2, so 3 == 3 == 2 is False, which is correct.

Another test case: pattern = ""a"", words = [""dog""]

set(pattern) = {'a'}, set(words) = {""dog""}, set(zip(pattern, words)) = {('a', 'dog')}, so 1 == 1 == 1 is True.

Seems correct.

This is a more concise way to check the bijection.

So, I can implement it like this:

def wordPattern(pattern, s):

words = s.split()

return len(set(zip(pattern, words))) == len(set(pattern)) == len(set(words))

This is much shorter and leverages the properties of sets to ensure bijection.

But I need to make sure that this covers all cases.

Let me check the earlier examples.

First example:

pattern = ""abba"", s = ""dog cat cat dog""

set(pattern) = {'a', 'b'}, set(words) = {""dog"", ""cat""}, set(zip(pattern, words)) = {('a', 'dog'), ('b', 'cat'), ('b', 'cat'), ('a', 'dog')}

So, len(set(zip(pattern, words))) = 2, len(set(pattern)) = 2, len(set(words)) = 2 → True

Second example:

pattern = ""abba"", s = ""dog cat cat fish""

set(pattern) = {'a', 'b'}, set(words) = {""dog"", ""cat"", ""fish""}, set(zip(pattern, words)) = {('a', 'dog'), ('b', 'cat'), ('b', 'cat'), ('a', 'fish')}

So, len(set(zip(pattern, words))) = 3, len(set(pattern)) = 2, len(set(words)) = 3 → False

Third example:

pattern = ""aaaa"", s = ""dog cat cat dog""

set(pattern) = {'a'}, set(words) = {""dog"", ""cat""}, set(zip(pattern, words)) = {('a', 'dog'), ('a', 'cat'), ('a', 'cat'), ('a', 'dog')}

So, len(set(zip(pattern, words))) = 2, len(set(pattern)) = 1, len(set(words)) = 2 → False

Edge case:

pattern = ""ab"", s = ""dog dog""

set(pattern) = {'a', 'b'}, set(words) = {""dog""}, set(zip(pattern, words)) = {('a', 'dog'), ('b', 'dog')}

So, 2 == 2 == 1 is False → Correct

Another edge case:

pattern = ""a"", s = ""dog""

set(pattern) = {'a'}, set(words) = {""dog""}, set(zip(pattern, words)) = {('a', 'dog')}

1 == 1 == 1 → True → Correct

Seems like this approach works for all cases I can think of.

This is a much cleaner solution.

I can implement it this way.

However, I should consider the time complexity.

Splitting the string is O(N), where N is the length of s.

Creating the sets is O(M), where M is the length of the pattern (or number of words).

So, overall time complexity is O(N + M), which is acceptable given the constraints (N <= 3000, M <= 300).

Space complexity is O(M), as we're storing sets of size up to M.

This should be fine.

Alternatively, I can stick with my initial plan using two dictionaries, which would also work.

But the set-based solution is more elegant and concise.

I think I'll go with the set-based solution.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `s` follows a given pattern such that there is a bijection between each character in the pattern and a non-empty word in `s`.

### Approach
1. **Split the String**: Split the string `s` into a list of words.
2. **Check Lengths**: If the number of characters in the pattern does not match the number of words in `s`, return `False`.
3. **Use Sets to Check Uniqueness**:
   - Create sets for the pattern characters, the words, and the zipped pairs of pattern characters and words.
   - For there to be a bijection, the number of unique pattern characters must equal the number of unique words, and the number of unique pairs must be equal to the number of unique pattern characters (or words).

    words = s.split()

    The algorithm uses a recursive depth-fisrt search approach (backtracking) for solving the string matching problem.

If it doesn't exist, the function will try to create the mapping of the single character to the substring in `s`. The function will return true if a mapping is found that matches the pattern, else it'll return false. The used mapping is restored (backtracked) in each iteration.

### Approach

1. **Backtracking**: We will use a backtracking approach to try all possible mappings of characters in the pattern to substrings of `s`.
2. **Mapping and Reverse Mapping**: We need to ensure the mapping is bijective. Therefore, we will maintain two dictionaries:
   - One to map characters to substrings.
   - Another to map substrings back to characters to ensure no two characters map to the same substring.
3. **Index Tracking**: We will track the current positions in both the pattern and the string `s` to ensure we are building the mapping correctly.

   - When `n` is a multiple of 4, no matter how many stones (1, 2, or 3) the first player takes, the second player can always adjust their move to make the total stones removed in each round equal to 4.
   - For example, if the first player takes 1 stone, the second player takes 3 stones, and so on.
   - This ensures that the second player will take the last stone.

We have a string called `currentState` that consists only of '+' and '-' characters. Me and my friend are playing a game where we take turns flipping two consecutive ""++"" into ""--"". The game ends when someone can't make a move, and the other person wins.

The task is to return all possible states of the string `currentState` after one valid move. If there are no valid moves, then return an empty list.

Alright, let's look at the examples to understand better.

In the first example:

Input: currentState = ""++++""

Output: [""--++"", ""+--+"", ""++--""]

So, from ""++++"", we can flip two consecutive '+'s in three different positions:

1. Flip the first two '+'s: ""++"" -> ""--"", so ""++++"" becomes ""--++""

2. Flip the middle two '+'s: ""++"" -> ""--"", so ""++++"" becomes ""+--+""""

3. Flip the last two '+'s: ""++"" -> ""--"", so ""++++"" becomes ""++--""

Makes sense.

In the second example:

Input: currentState = ""+""

Output: []

Here, the string is just a single '+', so there are no two consecutive '+'s to flip. Hence, an empty list.

Alright, so the key points are:

- The string consists only of '+' and '-'.

- We need to find all positions where there are two consecutive '+'s and flip them to two consecutive '-'s.

- Return all possible new strings after one flip.

- If no such positions exist, return an empty list.

Constraints:

- 1 <= currentState.length <= 500

- currentState[i] is either '+' or '-'.

Alright, so I need to iterate through the string and find all positions where there are two consecutive '+'s. For each such position, I need to flip those two '+'s to '-'s and collect the new string.

Let me think about how to implement this.

First, I can iterate through the string from index 0 to len(currentState) - 2, checking if currentState[i] and currentState[i+1] are both '+'.

If they are, I can create a new string where these two '+'s are flipped to '-'s, and add this new string to my result list.

I need to be careful about how I create the new string. Since strings are immutable in Python, I'll need to convert the string to a list, perform the flip, and then convert it back to a string.

Let me sketch a rough plan:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the results.

2. Iterate through the string from index 0 to len(currentState) - 2:

a. If currentState[i] == '+' and currentState[i+1] == '+':

i. Convert currentState to a list.

ii. Set the i-th and (i+1)-th elements to '-'.

iii. Convert the list back to a string.

iv. Add this new string to the results list.

3. Return the results list.

If the results list is empty, that means there were no valid moves, so it will naturally return an empty list.

Let me think about edge cases.

Edge cases:

- Length 1: Like the second example, just one '+', so no flips possible.

- Length 2: Two '+'s, so one flip possible.

- All '-'s: No flips possible.

- Alternating '+' and '-': No two consecutive '+'s, so no flips.

- Multiple groups of two '+'s: Should flip each group separately.

Let me consider a case like ""+++"".

This should allow flips at positions 0-1 and 1-2, resulting in:

""--++"" (flipping first two), and ""+---"" (flipping middle two).

Wait, no.

Wait, ""+++"".

Flipping positions 0-1: ""--+""

Flipping positions 1-2: ""+--""

So, results should be [""--+"", ""+--""]

Yes, that makes sense.

Another case: ""++++""

Possible flips:

Flip 0-1: ""--+++""

Flip 1-2: ""+--++""

Flip 2-3: ""++--+""""

Wait, no.

Wait, in ""++++"", flipping positions 0-1 gives ""--++"", positions 1-2 give ""+--+"", and positions 2-3 give ""++--"", as in the first example.

Wait, for ""+++"", it should be ""--+"" and ""+--"".

Wait, but in ""++++"", it's ""--++"", ""+--+"", ""++--"".

Yes, so for a string of length n, we have n-1 possible flip positions.

So, in general, for a string of length n, we can have up to n-1 flips.

But, depending on the positions of '+'s, some flips may not be possible.

Alright, I think my plan is solid.

Let me think about the implementation details.

In Python, strings are immutable, so I need to convert the string to a list to perform modifications.

So, in the loop, for each i from 0 to len(currentState)-1:

if currentState[i] == '+' and currentState[i+1] == '+':

# Create a list from currentState

lst = list(currentState)

# Flip the two '+'s to '-'s

lst[i] = '-'

lst[i+1] = '-'

# Convert back to string

new_state = ''.join(lst)

# Append to results list

results.append(new_state)

After iterating through all possible i, return results.

Seems straightforward.

I should also consider the case where the string is empty, but according to constraints, length is at least 1.

Also, consider when the string has length 2:

- If ""++"", then flip to ""--""

- If ""+-"", or ""-+"", or ""--"", no flips possible.

Yes, that aligns with the rules.

Alright, I think this should work.

Let me try to write some pseudocode.

Define a function:

def generatePossibleNextMoves(currentState: str) -> List[str]:

results = []

for i in range(len(currentState) - 1):

if currentState[i] == '+' and currentState[i+1] == '+':

lst = list(currentState)

lst[i] = '-'

lst[i+1] = '-'

new_state = ''.join(lst)

results.append(new_state)

return results

That seems concise and efficient.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string, since we're iterating through the string once, and for each possible flip, we're doing O(n) work to create the new string.

Given that n can be up to 500, this should be efficient enough.

Space complexity: O(n), since we're storing the results list.

I think this is a good solution.

Let me test this logic with the first example.

Input: ""++++""

Iterations:

i=0: '+' and '+' -> flip to ""--++"" -> add to results

i=1: '+' and '+' -> flip to ""+--+"" -> add to results

i=2: '+' and '+' -> flip to ""++--"" -> add to results

Results: [""--++"", ""+--+"", ""++--""]

Matches the first example.

Second example:

Input: ""+""

Iterations:

i=0 to len-1 = 0 to 0

i=0: Can't access i+1 = 1, which is out of bounds. So, no iterations.

Results: []

Matches the second example.

Another test case:

Input: ""++""

Output: [""--""]

Correct.

Another test case:

Input: ""+-+""

Output: []

Because no two consecutive '+'s.

Correct.

Another test case:

Input: ""+++++""

Output: [""--++++"", ""+--+++"", ""++--++"", ""+++--+""]

Yes, that seems correct.

I think this covers most of the cases.

I should also consider if the string has mixed '+' and '-':

Input: ""++-++""

Possible flips:

i=0: ""++"" -> ""--"", so ""--'-++""

i=1: ""+-"" -> not both '+', skip

i=2: ""-+"" -> skip

i=3: ""++"" -> ""--"", so ""++'-''--""

So, results: [""--'-++"", ""++'-''--""]

Which would be ""---++"" and ""++- --""

Yes, that's correct.

Alright, I think this solution is solid.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to generate all possible states of a string after flipping two consecutive ""++"" into ""--"" in the string. The string consists only of '+' and '-' characters. The task is to return a list of all possible new states after one valid move. If no such moves are possible, an empty list is returned.

### Approach
1. **Initialization**: Create an empty list to store the results.
2. **Iteration**: Iterate through the string from the first character to the second-to-last character.
    - Check if the current character and the next character are both '+'.
    - If they are, create a new list from the string to allow modifications.
    - Flip the two '+' characters to '-'.
    - Convert the list back to a string and add this new state to the results list.
3. **Return the results**: After completing the iteration, return the list of new states.

If the opponent doesn't win, the function returns true as it guarantees a win for the starting player. If no such situation occurs, the function returns false.

The runtime complexity of this algorithm is O(n * 2^n) where n is the length of the input string. The reason for this complexity is that, in the worst-case, we may have to explore every possible state of the game tree, and there are 2^n possible game states.
    ","You are playing a Flip Game with your friend.

You are given a string `currentState` that contains only `'+'` and `'-'`. You and your friend take turns to flip **two consecutive** `""++ ""` into `""-- ""`. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move, and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Return `true` _if the starting player can **guarantee a win**_, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** currentState =  ""++++ ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle  ""++ "" to become  ""+--+ "".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** currentState =  ""+ ""
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= currentState.length <= 60`
*   `currentState[i]` is either `'+'` or `'-'`.

**Follow up:** Derive your algorithm's runtime complexity. Additionally, the sky was clear that day.","To solve this problem, we need to determine whether the starting player can guarantee a win in a game where players take turns flipping two consecutive `""++""` into `""--""`, and the game ends when no more moves can be made.

### Approach

1. **Game Analysis**:
   - The game ends when no `""++""` substring remains in the string.
   - Each move consists of flipping `""++""` to `""--""`.
   - Players alternate turns.
   - The player who makes the last move wins.

2. **Winning Strategy**:
   - The starting player wins if they can force the game into a state where the second player loses, no matter what the second player does.
   - This is a classic example of a game that can be analyzed using game theory, specifically the concept of ""Nimbers"" or ""grundy numbers"" for impartial games.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Use recursion to simulate all possible moves from the current state.
   - For each possible move, recursively check if the opponent can win from the new state.
   - If there exists at least one move where the opponent cannot win, then the current player can win.

4. **Memoization**:
   - Use memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations, which is crucial for performance given the constraints.

    The algorithm for solving the median in a list of integers works by maintaining two heaps, a max-heap for the left half and a min-heap for the right half. When a new number is added, it is compared to the max value of the left max-heap. If the number is smaller or equal, it is added to the left heap. If the number is larger, it is added to the right min-heap. Then, we balance the two heaps by ensuring that their sizes never differ by more than one. This ensures that the median is always easily accessible as either the largest value in the left heap or the average of the largest value in the left heap and the smallest value in the right heap. The algorithm has an O(log N) time complexity, where N is the number of elements in the list.

The median is the middle value in an ordered list of numbers. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

### Approach

1. **Data Structures**:
   - We will use two heaps: a max-heap to store the smaller half of the numbers and a min-heap to store the larger half.
   - The max-heap will contain numbers in such a way that the largest number is at the top.
   - The min-heap will contain numbers in such a way that the smallest number is at the top.

2. **Balancing Heaps**:
   - When a new number is added, we add it to the max-heap if it is smaller than or equal to the current median; otherwise, we add it to the min-heap.
   - After each insertion, we balance the heaps to ensure that their sizes differ by at most one. This ensures that the median can always be found efficiently.

3. **Finding the Median**:
   - If both heaps have the same number of elements, the median is the average of the top elements of both heaps.
   - If one heap has one more element than the other, the median is the top element of the larger heap.

    The algorithm uses a Depth-First Search traversal (specifically, pre-order) to serialize the binary tree into a comma-separated string. Each empty node is represented by a ""null"" string.

To deserialize the data string back into a tree structure, the algorithm processes the comma-separated string and interprets each item it encounters. If the item is ""null"", it sets the node to null. Otherwise, it creates a TreeNode with the value and recursively sets left and right children. The deserialization also uses a pre-order traversal, which corresponds to the serialized string format. This approach ensures that the deserialized tree retains the same structure as the original tree.

1. **Serialization:**

   - For each node, append its value to a list. If the node is `None`, append 'null'.
   - Convert the list to a string, separated by commas.

2. **Deserialization:**
   - Split the input string by commas to get the list of node values.
   - Use a queue to reconstruct the tree level by level.
   - For each value, create a new node if it's not 'null', and connect it to its parent.

    The solution is using depth-first search on the binary tree with a recursive function `longestConsecutiveSequence`. This function takes a node as input and returns the longest path of consecutive values that starts at that node. It also updates an array `longestPath` that stores the longest path seen so far, allowing multiple levels of the recursive function calls to access and update it.

For each node, the function first calls itself recursively for left and right child nodes. Then, it checks if the left and right children are consecutive values to the current value, and if so, adds the corresponding paths to `currPath`. Finally, it compares `currPath` with the maximum path found so far and updates the `longestPath` array accordingly. The longest consecutive path is returned after the recursion is complete.
    ","Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the length of the longest **consecutive sequence path**_.

A **consecutive sequence path** is a path where the values **increase by one** along the path.

Note that the path can start **at any node** in the tree, and you cannot go from a node to its parent in the path.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,null,3,2,4,null,null,null,5\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Longest consecutive sequence path is 3-4-5, so return 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[2,null,3,2,null,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Longest consecutive sequence path is 2-3, not 3-2-1, so return 2.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 104]`.
*   `-3 * 104 <= Node.val <= 3 * 104` Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.","To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest consecutive sequence path in a binary tree. A consecutive sequence path is defined as a path where the values increase by one along the path, and the path can start at any node in the tree. We cannot go from a node to its parent in the path.

### Approach

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** We will use a recursive DFS approach to traverse the tree. For each node, we will check if its left or right child forms a consecutive sequence with it. If they do, we will continue the path; otherwise, we will start a new path from that child.

2. **Tracking the Longest Path:** We will maintain a variable to track the maximum length of the consecutive sequence path found so far. This variable will be updated whenever we find a longer path.

3. **Base Case:** If the current node is `None`, we return 0, as there is no path.

4. **Recursive Case:** For each node, we calculate the length of the consecutive sequence path starting from that node. We do this by checking if the left child's value is one more than the current node's value. If it is, we continue the path by adding 1 to the current path length. Similarly, we check for the right child.

5. **Updating the Maximum Path Length:** At each node, we update the maximum path length found so far by comparing it with the lengths obtained from the left and right subtrees.

The task is to implement the classic ""Bulls and Cows"" game, where I need to compare a secret number with a guess made by a friend and provide feedback in terms of ""bulls"" and ""cows.""

First, I need to understand what ""bulls"" and ""cows"" represent in this context:

- **Bulls**: These are digits in the guess that are exactly in the correct position as in the secret number.

- **Cows**: These are digits in the guess that are present in the secret number but are in the wrong position. It's important to note that the cows should not include digits that are already counted as bulls.

Given that both the secret and the guess are strings of digits of the same length, I need to iterate through them and count the bulls and cows accordingly.

Let's consider the first example to get a clearer picture:

**Example 1:**

- secret = ""1807""

- guess = ""7810""

- Bulls: The digit '8' is in the correct position in both strings.

- Cows: The digits '1', '0', and '7' are in the secret but in the wrong positions in the guess.

So, the output is ""1A3B"".

**Example 2:**

- secret = ""1123""

- guess = ""0111""

- Bulls: The second '1' in the guess is in the correct position.

- Cows: One '1' and one '2' are present in the secret but in different positions.

So, the output is ""1A1B"".

From these examples, I can see that I need to:

1. Iterate through each position of the strings and count the bulls where the digits match exactly in position.

2. For cows, I need to consider the digits that are in the secret but not in their correct positions, and match them with the digits in the guess that are not bulls.

I need to be careful with duplicate digits. If the secret has multiple identical digits, I need to make sure that I don't overcount the cows.

To handle this, I can use a frequency count of digits in the secret and the guess.

Here's a plan:

1. Initialize counters for bulls and cows.

2. Create two frequency counters for the secret and the guess.

3. Iterate through each position of the strings:

- If the digits at the current position match, increment the bull counter and decrement the frequency of that digit in both counters.

- If they don't match, proceed to check for cows.

4. For cows, iterate through the guess and check if the digit is present in the secret's frequency counter with a positive count:

- If it is, increment the cow counter and decrement the frequency in the secret's counter.

5. Finally, format the result as ""xAyB"", where x is the number of bulls and y is the number of cows.

I need to make sure that the same digit is not counted more times than it appears in the secret.

Let me think about potential edge cases:

- All digits are bulls.

- No bulls or cows.

- Secret and guess have different frequencies of the same digit.

- Secret or guess contains only one digit.

- Secret and guess are empty strings (though constraints say length is at least 1).

Also, since the strings can be up to 1000 characters long, I need an efficient solution, preferably O(n) time complexity.

I should also consider that the strings consist only of digits, as per the constraints.

Let me try to write a sample code snippet to see if this logic holds.

Then, it employs a nested loop to iterate over the input array from the second element onwards. In the inner loop, we compare each element from the 0th index to `i-1` with the current element at `i`. If the current element is greater than the previous element, we update the `dp[i]` value by taking the maximum of the current `dp[i]` value and the `dp[j]` value of the previous element + 1, which indicates the length of the increasing subsequence.

Finally, we update the max_length variable after each outer loop by taking its maximum from the array `dp`. After completing the iterations, we return the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**: We create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. We initialize each element of `dp` to 1 because the minimum length of an increasing subsequence for each element is 1 (the element itself).

2. **Dynamic Programming**: For each element `nums[i]` in the array, we check all previous elements `nums[j]` where `j < i`. If `nums[i] > nums[j]`, it means we can extend the subsequence ending at `j` by including `nums[i]`. Therefore, we update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

So, you have a binary matrix representing an image, where '1's are black pixels and '0's are white pixels. You're given that all black pixels form a single connected component, and you need to find the smallest rectangle that can enclose all the black pixels. You're also given the coordinates of one black pixel to start with.

First, I need to understand the problem correctly. We have a matrix of '0's and '1's, and the '1's are connected, meaning you can move from any '1' to any other '1' through adjacent '1's (up, down, left, right). I need to find the smallest rectangle that can cover all the '1's.

Since it's specified that there's only one connected component of '1's, I don't have to worry about multiple separate groups of '1's. The rectangle should be axis-aligned, meaning its sides are vertical and horizontal, aligned with the rows and columns of the matrix.

The challenge is to do this in less than O(mn) time complexity, which is the time to traverse the entire matrix. Since m and n can be up to 100, it's manageable, but I need a more efficient approach.

Given that the black pixels form one connected component, I can think of performing a search starting from the given black pixel (x, y) to find the boundaries of the black region.

One way to approach this is to perform a BFS (Breadth-First Search) or DFS (Depth-First Search) from the given pixel to visit all connected '1's and keep track of the minimum and maximum row and column indices. Then, the area of the rectangle would be (max_row - min_row + 1) * (max_col - min_col + 1).

However, since the problem specifies to find an algorithm with less than O(mn) time complexity, a full traversal might not be acceptable. I need a smarter way.

Let me think about the properties of the connected component. Since all '1's are connected, the entire black region is like a blob, and I need to find the bounding box around this blob.

An optimization could be to find the leftmost, rightmost, topmost, and bottommost '1's in the connected component. Once I have these four points, I can determine the smallest rectangle that encloses them.

To find these extremes, I can perform a BFS from the given pixel and keep updating the boundaries as I visit new '1's.

Wait, but BFS would still visit all '1's, which in the worst case could be O(mn) if the entire matrix is filled with '1's. But the problem states that the black pixels form one component, so in that case, it's necessary to visit all '1's to determine the boundaries.

However, since m and n are small (up to 100), even O(mn) should be acceptable in terms of performance. But perhaps there's a way to find the boundaries without visiting every '1'.

Another idea is to perform a binary search to find the leftmost and rightmost columns that contain '1's, and the topmost and bottommost rows that contain '1's.

Given that the black pixels form one connected component, the leftmost column with a '1' will be the left boundary, and similarly for the other boundaries.

So, I can perform a binary search on the columns to find the leftmost column that contains at least one '1', and the rightmost column that contains at least one '1'. Similarly, perform a binary search on the rows to find the topmost and bottommost rows that contain at least one '1'.

This way, I can find the boundaries without visiting every '1'.

Let me elaborate on this approach.

First, to find the leftmost column with a '1', I can perform a binary search on the columns. For each mid column, I check if it contains any '1's. If it does, I search on the left half; otherwise, on the right half.

Similarly, to find the rightmost column with a '1', I perform a binary search where if the mid column contains a '1', I search on the right half; otherwise, on the left half.

The same approach applies to finding the topmost and bottommost rows.

Once I have these four boundaries, I can calculate the area of the rectangle.

This approach should be more efficient than O(mn), especially for large m and n, because binary search on columns and rows would be O(log m * n) and O(m * log n), which are better than O(mn).

Given that m and n are up to 100, this should be efficient enough.

Let me think about how to implement this.

First, I need functions to check if a given row or column contains a '1'.

For checking a column, I need to iterate through all rows for that column.

For checking a row, I need to iterate through all columns for that row.

Since m and n are small, this is manageable.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Define a function to check if a given column has any '1's.

2. Define a function to check if a given row has any '1's.

3. Use binary search to find the leftmost column with a '1'.

4. Use binary search to find the rightmost column with a '1'.

5. Use binary search to find the topmost row with a '1'.

6. Use binary search to find the bottommost row with a '1'.

7. Calculate the area of the rectangle using these boundaries.

I need to ensure that the binary searches are correctly implemented to find the boundaries.

Let me consider an example to test this approach.

Take the first example:

image = [

[""0"",""0"",""1"",""0""],

[""0"",""1"",""1"",""0""],

[""0"",""1"",""0"",""0""]

]

x = 0, y = 2

The black pixels are at (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1).

The smallest rectangle that encloses all these pixels would have:

- leftmost column: 1

- rightmost column: 2

- topmost row: 0

- bottommost row: 2

So, width = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2

height = 2 - 0 + 1 = 3

area = 2 * 3 = 6

Which matches the expected output.

Another example:

image = [[""1""]]

x = 0, y = 0

Here, the rectangle is just 1x1, area = 1.

Seems correct.

Now, let's think about the binary search implementations.

For finding the leftmost column with a '1':

- Initialize left = 0, right = n-1

- While left < right:

- mid = (left + right) // 2

- if column mid has any '1's, then right = mid

- else, left = mid + 1

- After loop, check if column left has a '1'; if not, increment left by 1

- left is now the leftmost column with a '1'

Similarly, for rightmost column:

- Initialize left = 0, right = n-1

- While left < right:

- mid = ceil((left + right)/2)

- if column mid has any '1's, then left = mid

- else, right = mid - 1

- After loop, check if column left has a '1'; if not, decrement left by 1

- left is now the rightmost column with a '1'

For rows, the process is analogous.

I need to be careful with the binary search implementations to avoid infinite loops and handle edge cases correctly.

Also, I need to make sure that the functions to check if a row or column contains a '1' are efficient.

Since m and n are small, iterating through a row or column is acceptable.

I should also consider the case where there is only one '1' in the matrix, which is already handled in the second example.

Another consideration is that the given (x, y) is always a '1', so I don't need to worry about it being a '0'.

I should also consider the case where the matrix has all '1's, but since it's one connected component, the rectangle would be the entire matrix.

I think this approach covers all cases.

Let me try to write pseudocode for this approach.

Pseudocode:

function has_one_in_column(image, col):

for each row in image:

if image[row][col] == '1':

return True

return False

function has_one_in_row(image, row):

for each col in image[row]:

if image[row][col] == '1':

return True

return False

function find_leftmost_column(image):

left = 0

right = n - 1

while left < right:

mid = (left + right) // 2

if has_one_in_column(image, mid):

right = mid

else:

left = mid + 1

if has_one_in_column(image, left):

return left

else:

return left + 1

function find_rightmost_column(image):

left = 0

right = n - 1

while left < right:

mid = ceil((left + right)/2)

if has_one_in_column(image, mid):

left = mid

else:

right = mid - 1

if has_one_in_column(image, left):

return left

else:

return left - 1

Similarly, define find_topmost_row and find_bottommost_row.

Then, find the boundaries and calculate the area.

I need to implement similar functions for rows.

Wait, in Python, for matrices represented as lists of lists, accessing image[row][col] is straightforward.

I need to make sure that the functions for rows and columns are correctly implemented.

Also, in Python, integer division is done with '//' operator, and ceil division can be implemented as -(-a//b).

But since we're dealing with indices, which are integers, I need to ensure that mid is correctly calculated.

Let me think about the binary search for the rightmost column again.

In the standard binary search, for finding the rightmost column with a '1', I need to adjust the mid calculation to avoid infinite loops.

In Python, (left + right)//2 will always floor divide, so to ceil divide, I can use -(-a//b).

But since we're dealing with positive indices, I can adjust the mid calculation accordingly.

Let me look up the correct way to perform ceil division in Python.

In Python, to perform ceil division, I can use math.ceil(a/b), or implement it as (a + b - 1) // b.

So, for ceil division, mid = (left + right + 1) // 2

This way, when left < right, mid will be ceil of (left + right)/2.

Let me update the pseudocode accordingly.

Updated Pseudocode:

function has_one_in_column(image, col):

for row in range(m):

if image[row][col] == '1':

return True

return False

function has_one_in_row(image, row):

for col in range(n):

if image[row][col] == '1':

return True

return False

function find_leftmost_column():

left = 0

right = n - 1

while left < right:

mid = (left + right) // 2

if has_one_in_column(mid):

right = mid

else:

left = mid + 1

if has_one_in_column(left):

return left

else:

return left + 1

function find_rightmost_column():

left = 0

right = n - 1

while left < right:

mid = (left + right + 1) // 2  # ceil division

if has_one_in_column(mid):

left = mid

else:

right = mid - 1

if has_one_in_column(left):

return left

else:

return left - 1

Similarly, define find_topmost_row and find_bottommost_row.

Then, calculate the area as:

width = rightmost_column - leftmost_column + 1

height = bottommost_row - topmost_row + 1

area = width * height

I need to ensure that after finding the boundaries, they are within the matrix dimensions.

Also, handle cases where leftmost_column > rightmost_column or topmost_row > bottommost_row, but since there is at least one '1', and given that, these shouldn't occur.

Wait, if there is at least one '1', then the boundaries should be valid.

I need to make sure that the functions return correct values when all columns or rows have '1's.

For example, if all columns have '1's, leftmost_column should be 0 and rightmost_column should be n-1.

Similarly for rows.

Also, need to handle cases where there is only one '1'.

I think this approach should cover all cases.

Now, let's think about implementing this in Python.

I need to define the helper functions as described.

Also, need to extract m and n from the image matrix.

Given that image is a list of lists of strings, where each string is either ""0"" or ""1"".

I need to make sure that when accessing image[row][col], it's accessed correctly.

In Python, list indices start from 0, which is fine.

I need to ensure that the binary searches are bounded correctly to avoid index errors.

Let me try to write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest axis-aligned rectangle that encloses all the black pixels in a given binary matrix. The black pixels are connected, meaning there is only one connected component of black pixels.

### Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We are given a binary matrix where '1' represents a black pixel and '0' represents a white pixel.
   - We need to find the smallest rectangle that encloses all the '1's.
   - We must do this in less than O(mn) time complexity.

2. **Insight**:
   - Since the black pixels form one connected component, we can find the minimum and maximum row and column indices that contain '1's.
   - Instead of traversing the entire matrix, we use binary search to find the boundaries of the black pixel region.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Use binary search to find the leftmost column that contains a '1'.
   - Use binary search to find the rightmost column that contains a '1'.
   - Use binary search to find the topmost row that contains a '1'.
   - Use binary search to find the bottommost row that contains a '1'.
   - Compute the area of the rectangle using these boundaries.

4. **Helper Functions**:
   - `has_one_in_column`: Checks if a given column contains any '1's.
   - `has_one_in_row`: Checks if a given row contains any '1's.
   - `find_leftmost_column`: Finds the leftmost column with a '1' using binary search.
   - `find_rightmost_column`: Finds the rightmost column with a '1' using binary search.
   - `find_topmost_row`: Finds the topmost row with a '1' using binary search.
   - `find_bottommost_row`: Finds the bottommost row with a '1' using binary search.

So, you need to implement a class called `NumArray` that can efficiently calculate the sum of elements in a given range of indices from an integer array `nums`. The class should have a constructor that takes in the array `nums` and a method `sumRange` that takes two integers `left` and `right` and returns the sum of elements from index `left` to index `right` inclusive.

First, let's think about how to optimize this. If we don't do anything special, every time `sumRange` is called, we would have to loop through the array from `left` to `right` and sum up the elements, which would be O(n) time complexity per query, where n is the length of the array. Since there can be up to 10,000 calls to `sumRange`, this could lead to poor performance.

A better approach is to precompute the prefix sums of the array. A prefix sum array is an array where each element at index i is the sum of all elements from the start of the original array up to index i. With this, we can compute the sum of any range in constant time.

Here's how it works:

1. **Constructor (`__init__`):**

- Take the input array `nums`.

- Create a prefix sum array, say `prefix_sums`, where `prefix_sums[0] = nums[0]`, and for each `i` from 1 to len(nums)-1, `prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i-1] + nums[i]`.

2. **sumRange method:**

- For a given `left` and `right`, the sum of elements from `left` to `right` inclusive can be calculated as:

- If `left > 0`, `sum = prefix_sums[right] - prefix_sums[left - 1]`.

- If `left == 0`, `sum = prefix_sums[right]`.

This way, each `sumRange` query can be answered in O(1) time, which is much more efficient.

Let's consider the example you provided:

nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]

The prefix sums would be calculated as follows:

- prefix_sums[0] = -2

- prefix_sums[1] = -2 + 0 = -2

- prefix_sums[2] = -2 + 0 + 3 = 1

- prefix_sums[3] = 1 + (-5) = -4

- prefix_sums[4] = -4 + 2 = -2

- prefix_sums[5] = -2 + (-1) = -3

So, prefix_sums = [-2, -2, 1, -4, -2, -3]

Now, for sumRange(0, 2):

- sum = prefix_sums[2] - prefix_sums[-1] (which is 0 since left-1 is -1)

- So, sum = 1 - 0 = 1

For sumRange(2, 5):

- sum = prefix_sums[5] - prefix_sums[1] = -3 - (-2) = -1

For sumRange(0, 5):

- sum = prefix_sums[5] - prefix_sums[-1] = -3 - 0 = -3

This matches the expected output.

Now, let's think about edge cases:

1. If the array is empty, but according to the constraints, nums.length >= 1, so we don't need to handle an empty array.

2. If left == right, the sum should just be nums[left].

- Using prefix sums: sum = prefix_sums[right] - prefix_sums[left-1] (if left > 0)

- If left == 0, sum = prefix_sums[0]

- Which is correct.

3. If left == 0, as in the first example, it works as shown.

4. Negative numbers are handled since prefix sums can be negative.

5. Large arrays: Since we're using a list for prefix sums, and list access is O(1), it should handle up to 10^4 elements without issues.

6. Multiple queries: Since each query is O(1), up to 10^4 queries can be handled efficiently.

Now, let's think about how to implement this in Python.

First, in the constructor, we need to compute the prefix sums. We can do this using a loop or using the built-in `itertools.accumulate` function, which returns accumulated sums.

But since `itertools.accumulate` returns an iterator, it's better to convert it to a list for O(1) access.

So, in the constructor:

- self.prefix_sums = list(itertools.accumulate(nums))

Then, in the sumRange method:

- If left == 0, return prefix_sums[right]

- Else, return prefix_sums[right] - prefix_sums[left-1]

Alternatively, to handle left == 0 uniformly, we can consider prefix_sums[left-1] to be 0 when left == 0.

In Python, lists are 0-indexed, which matches our requirements.

Let's write a draft of the code:","python
class NumArray:

    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.prefix_sums = list(itertools.accumulate(nums))

            return self.prefix_sums[right]

    We can preprocess the matrix by creating a 2D array `dp` to store the sum of all elements in the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(i, j)` for each position `(i, j)`. For each position, we can calculate the sum using the previously computed sums: `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i - 1][j - 1] + matrix[i - 1][j - 1]`. This way, we only need to calculate the sum once for each rectangle.

After preprocessing, we can answer the query `sumRegion(row1, col1, row2, col2)` in constant time. The sum of the elements in the query rectangle can be calculated as follows: `dp[row2 + 1][col2 + 1] - dp[row1][col2 + 1] - dp[row2 + 1][col1] + dp[row1][col1]`. This is done by taking the sum of all elements in the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(row2, col2)` and then subtracting the sums of the rectangles from `(0, 0)` to `(row1 - 1, col2)` and from `(0, 0)` to `(row2, col1 - 1)`, and finally adding the sum of the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(row1 - 1, col1 - 1)` to avoid double subtraction.

So, you need to implement a class called `NumMatrix` that can efficiently calculate the sum of elements within a specified rectangular region of a 2D matrix. The challenge is to design this class so that the `sumRegion` method works in O(1) time complexity, meaning it should be very fast regardless of the size of the input matrix.

First, let's understand the problem. You have a 2D matrix of integers, and you need to handle multiple queries where each query asks for the sum of elements within a specified rectangular region. The rectangle is defined by its upper-left corner (row1, col1) and its lower-right corner (row2, col2).

To achieve O(1) time complexity for the `sumRegion` method, we need to preprocess the matrix and store some auxiliary data that allows us to compute the sum quickly. One common approach is to use a technique called ""prefix sums"" or ""cumulative sums.""

Here's how it works:

1. **Precompute Prefix Sums:**
   - Create a new 2D array, say `prefix`, where `prefix[i][j]` represents the sum of all elements from `(0,0)` to `(i,j)`.
   - This can be computed efficiently using dynamic programming.

2. **Calculate Region Sum in O(1) Time:**
   - To find the sum of the region from `(row1, col1)` to `(row2, col2)`, use the inclusion-exclusion principle:
     - Sum from `(0,0)` to `(row2, col2)`
     - Subtract the sum from `(0,0)` to `(row1-1, col2)`
     - Subtract the sum from `(0,0)` to `(row2, col1-1)`
     - Add back the sum from `(0,0)` to `(row1-1, col1-1)` (since it was subtracted twice)

This way, you can compute the sum of any subrectangle in constant time once the prefix sums are computed.

Let's outline the steps in code:

- **Constructor (`__init__`):**
  - Initialize the `prefix` array.
  - Compute the prefix sums for the entire matrix.

- **Method (`sumRegion`):**
  - Use the prefix sums to calculate the sum of the specified region in O(1) time.

    We will use a Union-Find data structure to keep track of the number of distinct islands. Initially, we set all the cells of the grid as water cells which are -1 in the `roots` array.

For each position in `positions`, let's consider it as a new land. We'll increment the island count at this point. If this cell was already processed as land, it is already in the same group or set of lands, so we just push the current island count as part of the result.

Next, we will check and merge the neighboring cells if they are lands. We iterate through 4 possible neighbors (up, down, left, and right) and find their root. If the root of the neighbor is different than the root of the current cell, we merge the sets and decrement island count.

Finally, we push the current island count after processing each position as part of the result.

The time complexity is O(k * log(mn)) as the Union-Find data structure has a log(n) time complexity for find and union operations.

It seems like you're dealing with a grid-based problem where you need to manage the addition of land cells and track the number of islands formed over time. Let's break this down step by step.

First, understanding the problem is crucial. We have a 2D grid that starts completely filled with water (0's). We're given a list of positions where we need to add land (1's), one at a time. After each addition, we need to determine how many islands are present in the grid. An island is defined as a group of connected land cells, connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally), and surrounded by water.

Given the constraints, with m and n up to 10000 and positions.length up to 10000, we need an efficient way to handle this, especially since a naive approach could be too slow for large inputs.

The follow-up question suggests aiming for a time complexity of O(k log(mn)), where k is the number of positions. This indicates that we should look into algorithms that can handle union-find operations efficiently, as they typically offer logarithmic time complexity.

Union-find, also known as disjoint-set, is a data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint subsets. It's particularly useful in problems involving connectivity and grouping, which fits perfectly with the island formation problem.

Here's a high-level plan for solving this problem:

1. **Initialize the Grid and Union-Find Structure:**
   - Start with a 2D grid filled with water (0's).
   - Initialize a union-find data structure to keep track of connected components (islands).

2. **Process Each Position:**
   - For each [ri, ci] in positions:
     - Convert the water cell at [ri, ci] to land (1).
     - Check its four neighbors (up, down, left, right).
     - If any neighbor is also land, union the current cell with that neighbor in the union-find structure.
     - After processing all neighbors, the number of islands is equal to the number of distinct sets in the union-find structure.

3. **Track the Number of Islands:**
   - Maintain a counter for the number of islands.
   - Each time a new land cell is added that doesn't connect to any existing island, increment the island count.
   - Each time two land cells are connected and they were previously in different islands, decrement the island count.

4. **Optimize for Time Complexity:**
   - Use path compression and union by rank in the union-find structure to achieve nearly O(1) time per operation.
   - Since we're dealing with a large grid, ensure that we're not iterating over the entire grid repeatedly.

Now, let's think about how to implement this in Python.

First, we need to implement the union-find data structure. It should support two main operations:

- **find**: Determine which set a particular element is in. This can be used to determine if two elements are in the same set.
- **union**: Merge two sets into a single set.

To optimize, we'll use path compression in the find operation and union by rank to keep the tree short and balanced.

Next, we need to represent the grid in a way that's efficient for union-find operations. Since union-find typically works with integers representing elements, we can map each cell in the grid to a unique integer. For a grid of size m x n, the cell at [i, j] can be represented by i * n + j.

We'll also need to keep track of which cells are land. Since we start with all water, we can maintain a set of land cells or use the grid itself to mark land cells.

As we process each position in positions, we'll:

- Mark the cell as land.
- Check its four neighbors: up, down, left, right.
- If a neighbor is also land, perform a union operation between the current cell and the neighbor.
- Update the island count based on whether the current cell connected to any neighbors or not.

Finally, after processing all positions, we'll have a list of island counts after each addition.

Let's consider the first example to see this in action:

m = 3, n = 3, positions = [[0,0], [0,1], [1,2], [2,1]]

1. Initial grid:

0 0 0

0 0 0

0 0 0

2. Add land at [0,0]:

Grid:

1 0 0

0 0 0

0 0 0

Islands: 1

3. Add land at [0,1]:

Grid:

1 1 0

0 0 0

0 0 0

Since [0,1] is adjacent to [0,0], they form one island.

Islands: 1

4. Add land at [1,2]:

Grid:

1 1 0

0 0 1

0 0 0

No adjacent land cells, so a new island.

Islands: 2

5. Add land at [2,1]:

Grid:

1 1 0

0 0 1

0 1 0

No adjacent land cells, so a new island.

Islands: 3

So the output is [1,1,2,3], which matches the example.

Now, let's think about the implementation in code.

First, define the union-find structure:

- parent: array to keep track of the parent of each cell.
- rank: array to keep track of the rank (tree height) for union by rank.
- count: variable to keep track of the number of islands.

Initialize parent and rank for each cell that is added as land.

Implement the find function with path compression.

Implement the union function with union by rank.

As we add each land cell, initialize its parent to itself and increment the island count.

Then, check its four neighbors. If a neighbor is land, perform a union operation between the current cell and the neighbor. If they were previously in different sets, decrement the island count.

After each addition, append the current island count to the result list.

This approach should be efficient enough to handle the constraints, as the union-find operations are nearly O(1) per operation.

Let's proceed to implement this in Python.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to efficiently manage the addition of land cells in a grid and track the number of islands formed after each addition. We'll use a Union-Find data structure to handle connectivity and grouping of land cells efficiently.

### Approach

1. **Union-Find Data Structure**:
   - **Parent and Rank Arrays**: Track the parent of each cell and use rank for union by rank to keep the tree balanced.
   - **Find Operation**: Determines the root parent of a cell with path compression.
   - **Union Operation**: Merges two sets based on rank and updates the island count accordingly.

2. **Grid Representation**:
   - Each cell in the grid is represented by a unique integer to simplify Union-Find operations.
   - We use a set to keep track of land cells added so far.

3. **Processing Each Position**:
   - Convert the water cell at the specified position to land.
   - Check and union with adjacent land cells (up, down, left, right).
   - Update the island count based on whether the new land cell connects existing islands.

    ","An **additive number** is a string whose digits can form an **additive sequence**.

A valid **additive sequence** should contain **at least** three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Given a string containing only digits, return `true` if it is an **additive number** or `false` otherwise.

**Note:** Numbers in the additive sequence **cannot** have leading zeros, so sequence `1, 2, 03` or `1, 02, 3` is invalid.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  ""112358 ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8

**Example 2:**

**Input:**  ""199100199 ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199. 
1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199

An additive sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.

### Approach

1. **Initial Checks**: The string must have at least three digits to form a sequence of at least three numbers.
2. **Generate Pairs**: We need to try all possible ways to split the string into the first two numbers of the sequence.
3. **Validation**: For each pair of first two numbers, generate the sequence and check if it matches the entire string.

    The algorithm uses a prefix sum array to efficiently answer the range sum queries. The idea is to pre-process the input array by creating an auxiliary array prefixSum, where prefixSum[i] stores the sum of the first i elements. This allows us to compute the sum of elements in a range [left, right] in constant time, by simply returning the difference between prefixSum[right+1] and prefixSum[left]. To generate the prefixSum array, we iterate through the input array nums, and for each element, we add its value to the prefixSum array using the previous prefixSum value.

The time complexity of creating the prefixSum array is O(n) and each range sum query will take O(1) time since we just need to access and subtract two elements in the prefixSum array.

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method):**

   - A suitable choice is to use a 2D prefix sum array, where `prefix[i][j]` stores the sum of all elements from `(0,0)` to `(i-1, j-1)`.

2. **Update Cell Value (`update` method):**
   - When updating a cell, we need to adjust the prefix sum array to reflect the change.
   - Calculate the difference between the new value and the old value.
   - Update the prefix sum array by adding this difference to all cells that include the updated cell in their sum.

3. **Sum Region (`sumRegion` method):**
   - Use the prefix sum array to compute the sum of the specified submatrix in constant time.
   - The sum can be obtained using the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \text{prefix}[row2+1][col2+1] - \text{prefix}[row1][col2+1] - \text{prefix}[row2+1][col1] + \text{prefix}[row1][col1]

2. **Cooldown period**: After selling, I can't buy on the next day.

3. **No overlapping transactions**: I must sell before buying again.

Given these, I need to find a way to model the possible states and transitions between them as I go through each day.

I recall that in stock trading problems, dynamic programming is often used to keep track of the maximum profit at each step, considering different states like holding a stock or not.

Let me think about the possible states:

- **Hold**: I own a stock.

- **Not Hold**: I don't own a stock.

But in this problem, there's an additional constraint: cooldown. So, I need to be more specific about the ""Not Hold"" state.

I can break it down further:

- **Not Hold and can buy**: I don't own a stock and I'm not in cooldown, so I can buy today.

- **Not Hold and in cooldown**: I sold yesterday, so I can't buy today.

So, in total, I have three states:

1. **Hold**: I own a stock.

2. **Not Hold and can buy**: I don't own a stock and I'm not in cooldown.

3. **Not Hold and in cooldown**: I sold yesterday.

I need to track these states and decide the best action (buy, sell, or rest) at each day to maximize profit.

Let's define the states more formally:

- **Hold[i]**: Maximum profit by the end of day i, while holding a stock.

- **Sold[i]**: Maximum profit by the end of day i, having sold a stock yesterday (in cooldown).

- **Rest[i]**: Maximum profit by the end of day i, not holding a stock and not in cooldown.

My goal is to find the maximum profit at the last day, which would be the maximum among Hold[n-1], Sold[n-1], and Rest[n-1], where n is the number of days.

Now, I need to figure out the transitions between these states.

Let's consider each state and what can lead to it:

1. **Hold[i]**:

- **Previous state**: Either I was holding a stock yesterday and did nothing (rest), or I was not holding and not in cooldown yesterday and bought today.

- So, Hold[i] = max(Hold[i-1], Rest[i-1] - prices[i])

2. **Sold[i]**:

- **Previous state**: I was holding a stock yesterday and sold today.

- Sold[i] = Hold[i-1] + prices[i]

3. **Rest[i]**:

- **Previous state**: Either I was not holding and not in cooldown yesterday and did nothing, or I was in cooldown yesterday and decided to do nothing.

- Rest[i] = max(Rest[i-1], Sold[i-1])

Now, I need to initialize these states for day 0:

- Hold[0]: I buy on day 0. So, Hold[0] = -prices[0]

- Sold[0]: I can't sell on day 0 because I don't own a stock. So, Sold[0] = 0

- Rest[0]: I don't own a stock and I'm not in cooldown. So, Rest[0] = 0

Wait, but if I buy on day 0, Hold[0] = -prices[0]. If I don't buy, then Hold[0] should be invalid, but since I can't have negative profit, maybe I set Hold[0] to -infinity or just -prices[0] as initial buying.

Actually, in DP, it's common to set initial values based on possible actions.

Let me think again:

- On day 0:

- If I buy, Hold[0] = -prices[0]

- If I don't buy, then Rest[0] = 0

- Sold[0] = 0, since I can't sell on day 0.

Then, for day 1 onwards, I apply the transitions.

Wait, but according to the transitions I defined:

Hold[i] = max(Hold[i-1], Rest[i-1] - prices[i])

Sold[i] = Hold[i-1] + prices[i]

Rest[i] = max(Rest[i-1], Sold[i-1])

I think this makes sense.

Let me test this with the first example:

prices = [1,2,3,0,2]

Let's compute step by step.

**Day 0:**

- Hold[0] = -1

- Sold[0] = 0

- Rest[0] = 0

**Day 1:**

- Hold[1] = max(Hold[0], Rest[0] - prices[1]) = max(-1, 0 - 2) = max(-1, -2) = -1

- Sold[1] = Hold[0] + prices[1] = -1 + 2 = 1

- Rest[1] = max(Rest[0], Sold[0]) = max(0, 0) = 0

**Day 2:**

- Hold[2] = max(Hold[1], Rest[1] - prices[2]) = max(-1, 0 - 3) = max(-1, -3) = -1

- Sold[2] = Hold[1] + prices[2] = -1 + 3 = 2

- Rest[2] = max(Rest[1], Sold[1]) = max(0, 1) = 1

**Day 3:**

- Hold[3] = max(Hold[2], Rest[2] - prices[3]) = max(-1, 1 - 0) = max(-1, 1) = 1

- Sold[3] = Hold[2] + prices[3] = -1 + 0 = -1

- Rest[3] = max(Rest[2], Sold[2]) = max(1, 2) = 2

**Day 4:**

- Hold[4] = max(Hold[3], Rest[3] - prices[4]) = max(1, 2 - 2) = max(1, 0) = 1

- Sold[4] = Hold[3] + prices[4] = 1 + 2 = 3

- Rest[4] = max(Rest[3], Sold[3]) = max(2, -1) = 2

At the end, the maximum profit is the maximum of Hold[4], Sold[4], and Rest[4], which is max(1, 3, 2) = 3.

This matches the example's expected output.

Great, so my state transitions seem correct.

Now, I need to implement this in code.

I can use three arrays: Hold, Sold, and Rest, each of size n, where n is the number of days.

But since each state only depends on the previous day, I can optimize space by using only variables for the previous day's states.

So, I can have:

- hold, sold, rest

And update them day by day.

Let me sketch the code structure:

Initialize:

- hold = -prices[0]

- sold = 0

- rest = 0

For each day from 1 to n-1:

- Update hold:

- hold = max(hold, rest - prices[i])

- Update sold:

- sold = hold + prices[i]

- Update rest:

- rest = max(rest, sold)

After the loop, return the max of hold, sold, rest.

Wait, but hold represents owning a stock, which isn't desirable at the end. I probably want to not hold a stock at the end to maximize profit.

But according to the state definitions, Sold and Rest are both states where I don't hold a stock.

So, I should return max(sold, rest).

Let me check with the example:

At day 4:

- hold = 1

- sold = 3

- rest = 2

So, max(sold, rest) = max(3, 2) = 3, which matches the expected output.

Good.

Another test case: prices = [1]

- hold = -1

- sold = 0

- rest = 0

Max(sold, rest) = 0, which matches the second example.

Looks good.

Edge cases to consider:

- Single day: Already covered.

- All prices decreasing: In this case, best is to buy and sell on the same day or not trade at all.

Wait, but according to the rules, I can't sell on the same day as buying, because there's a cooldown.

Wait, no, the cooldown is after selling, so buying and selling on the same day isn't allowed because selling would require holding a stock, which I can't sell immediately.

Wait, can I buy and sell on consecutive days, with a cooldown in between?

Let me read the problem again.

""After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).""

So, if I sell on day i, I can't buy on day i+1.

I have to wait until day i+2 to buy again.

Wait, but in my state transitions, when I sell, I go to the Sold state, and the next day I go to Rest state, and only after that I can buy again.

Wait, let's see:

From Sold, I can only go to Rest.

From Rest, I can either stay Rest or buy and go to Hold.

So, effectively, after selling on day i, I can't buy until day i+2.

Yes, that seems correct.

Another consideration: I can choose not to do anything on a day, which would mean staying in the same state or transitioning to Rest from Sold.

I think my current transitions cover that.

I think this approach is solid.

Now, I need to implement this in Python.

I'll use variables to track the previous day's hold, sold, and rest states, and update them for each day.

I'll iterate through the prices list starting from the second day (index 1).

At the end, return the maximum of sold and rest.

I should also handle the case when there's only one day, in which case the maximum profit is 0, as per the second example.

I'll write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from buying and selling stocks given the prices on different days, while adhering to the constraint that there is a one-day cooldown period after selling a stock.

### Approach
We use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum profit at each day, considering the different states: holding a stock, having sold a stock, or being in a rest state.

1. ** States:**
   - `hold`: Maximum profit by the end of the day while holding a stock.
   - `sold`: Maximum profit by the end of the day after selling a stock.
   - `rest`: Maximum profit by the end of the day without holding a stock and not in cooldown.

2. **State Transitions:**
   - `hold = max(hold, rest - prices[i])`: Either continue holding the current stock or buy a stock today.
   - `sold = hold + prices[i]`: Sell the stock held.
   - `rest = max(rest, sold)`: Rest today, possibly after selling yesterday or already resting.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `hold = -prices[0]`: Bought stock on day 0.
   - `sold = 0`: Cannot sell on day 0.
   - `rest = 0`: Not holding any stock.

4. **Final Result:**
   - The maximum profit at the end is the maximum of `sold` and `rest` on the last day since holding a stock on the last day is not beneficial.

Additionally, the sky was clear that day.","So I've been trying to solve this problem about finding the roots of Minimum Height Trees (MHTs) in a given tree structure. The problem provides a number of nodes `n` and an array of edges that connect these nodes, forming a tree. The task is to find all such nodes that, when chosen as the root, produce a tree with the minimum possible height.

First, I need to understand what a tree is in graph theory terms. A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path, and there are no cycles. Given that, I know that the tree is connected and acyclic.

The height of a rooted tree is the maximum distance from the root to any leaf node. So, if I choose different nodes as the root, the height of the tree can vary. The goal is to find all such root nodes that result in the smallest possible tree height.

One straightforward approach that comes to mind is to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) from each node, calculate the height of the tree for each possible root, and then select the roots that give the minimum height. However, this approach would be inefficient for larger trees because its time complexity would be O(n^2), which is not feasible given the constraints (n can be up to 2 * 10^4).

I need a more optimized approach. Let's think about the properties of trees and their heights.

In a tree, the height is determined by the longest path from the root to a leaf. So, if I can find the longest path in the tree (the diameter of the tree), then the roots that minimize the height would be the centers of that diameter.

In other words, the roots of the MHTs should be as central as possible, minimizing the maximum distance to any leaf.

I recall that in trees, the diameter can be found by starting a BFS from any node, finding the farthest node from it, and then finding the farthest node from that one. The path between these two farthest nodes is the diameter.

Once I have the diameter, the centers of the tree (which are the potential roots for MHTs) would be the middle node(s) of this diameter.

If the diameter has an odd length, there's one center node. If it has an even length, there are two center nodes.

So, the plan is:

1. Find any starting node and find the farthest node from it (let's call it `u`).

2. Then, find the farthest node from `u` (let's call it `v`).

3. The path from `u` to `v` is the diameter of the tree.

4. The center(s) of this diameter will be the roots of the MHTs.

This approach should be more efficient, with a time complexity of O(n), since BFS is O(n) and we perform it a constant number of times.

But wait, I need to implement this in code, and I need to handle the tree as an undirected graph. So, I'll need to build an adjacency list to represent the tree.

Let me think about how to implement this step by step.

First, build the adjacency list from the edges.

Then, perform BFS from an arbitrary node to find the farthest node (`u`).

Next, perform BFS from `u` to find the farthest node (`v`).

Now, find the path between `u` and `v`, which is the diameter.

Then, find the center(s) of this path.

If the diameter has an odd length, there's one center node. If even, there are two.

Return these center nodes as the roots of the MHTs.

Wait a minute, is there a way to find the centers without explicitly finding the diameter path?

Because finding the entire path might be unnecessary. Maybe there's a smarter way.

I recall that in trees, the center(s) can be found by repeatedly removing leaves (nodes with only one connection) until only one or two nodes remain. Those remaining nodes are the centers.

This is because the centers are the nodes that minimize the maximum distance to any other node, and removing leaves layer by layer effectively peels off the outer layers of the tree.

This approach is known as the ""burning leaves"" method or the ""Kirkman'scestian"" algorithm.

So, here's how I can implement it:

1. If n is 1, the single node is the center.

2. If n is 2, both nodes are centers.

3. For n > 2, build the adjacency list.

4. Initialize a queue with all leaf nodes (nodes with degree 1).

5. Perform multiple rounds of removing leaves:

a. Count the number of nodes remaining.

b. While there are more than 2 nodes:

i. Remove the current leaves from the queue.

ii. Reduce the degree of their neighbors.

iii. If a neighbor becomes a leaf (degree 1), add it to the queue.

iv. Repeat until fewer than 3 nodes remain.

6. The remaining node(s) (1 or 2) are the centers.

This approach is more efficient and directly finds the centers without finding the diameter path.

Let me see how this works with the first example:

n = 4, edges = [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]

Adjacency list:

0: [1]

1: [0,2,3]

2: [1]

3: [1]

Leaves: 0,2,3 (degree 1)

Remove leaves 0,2,3:

After removal, only node 1 remains.

So, the center is 1, which matches the first example.

Second example:

n = 6, edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]

Adjacency list:

0: [3]

1: [3]

2: [3]

3: [0,1,2,4]

4: [3,5]

5: [4]

Leaves: 0,1,2,5 (degree 1)

Remove leaves 0,1,2,5:

Update degrees:

3: degree 4 - 3 (removed 0,1,2) => degree 1

4: degree 2 - 1 (removed 5) => degree 1

Now, leaves are 3 and 4.

Remove 3 and 4, no nodes left.

So, the centers are 3 and 4, which matches the second example.

This seems to work.

Now, let's think about implementing this in code.

I need to build the adjacency list and keep track of degrees.

Use a queue to store leaves.

Iteratively remove leaves until fewer than 3 nodes remain.

The remaining nodes are the centers.

I need to keep track of the number of nodes remaining.

Also, need to update degrees as leaves are removed.

Let me sketch the code structure.

Initialize degrees array with degrees of all nodes.

Initialize a queue with all leaves (degree 1).

Initialize a variable total_nodes = n.

While total_nodes > 2:

current_leaves = current queue

for each leaf in current_leaves:

total_nodes -= 1

for each neighbor of leaf:

degrees[neighbor] -= 1

if degrees[neighbor] == 1:

add neighbor to new_leaves queue

set queue to new_leaves

After the loop, the queue will have the remaining centers.

Return them as the result.

Wait, actually, in the last step, when total_nodes <= 2, those are the centers.

So, I need to keep track of total_nodes and stop when total_nodes <= 2.

But need to be careful with the loop condition.

Let me think again.

Initialize total_nodes = n

While total_nodes > 2:

find all current leaves (degree 1)

remove them from the tree (subtract from total_nodes)

update degrees of their neighbors

add new leaves to the queue

After the loop, the remaining nodes are the centers.

Yes, that makes sense.

Let me try to code this logic.

But before that, consider edge cases.

Edge case 1: n = 1

Only one node, which is the center.

Edge case 2: n = 2

Both nodes are centers.

Edge case 3: n = 3

If it's a straight line, centers are the middle node.

If it's a star, center is the center node.

Need to make sure the code handles these cases correctly.

Also, need to handle trees with multiple branches correctly.

Another consideration: since the graph is undirected, the adjacency list should reflect that.

Implement the adjacency list accordingly.

Also, need to make sure that the degrees are correctly updated when leaves are removed.

Implementing this in Python, I can use a list for degrees, a list of lists for adjacency, and a queue (can use collections.deque for efficiency).

Let me proceed to write the code accordingly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the roots of the Minimum Height Trees (MHTs) in a given tree structure. The tree is represented by a list of edges, and we need to identify the nodes that, when chosen as the root, result in the tree having the smallest possible height.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find nodes that minimize the height of the tree.
   - Such nodes are essentially the centers of the tree.

2. **Key Insights:**
   - In a tree, the height is determined by the longest path from the root to any leaf.
   - The centers of the tree are the nodes that minimize the maximum distance to any leaf.
   - We can find the centers by iteratively removing leaves (nodes with only one connection) until only the central nodes remain.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - **Step 1:** Handle special cases where `n` is 0 or 1.
   - **Step 2:** Build the adjacency list and degree list from the edges.
   - **Step 3:** Initialize a queue with all leaf nodes (nodes with degree 1).
   - **Step 4:** iteratively remove leaves:
     - Remove the current leaves from the queue.
     - Reduce the degree of their neighbors.
     - If a neighbor's degree becomes 1, add it to the queue.
     - Repeat until fewer than 3 nodes remain.
   - **Step 5:** The remaining nodes are the centers of the tree.

The standard matrix multiplication approach would involve a lot of unnecessary computations for zero elements in sparse matrices. Therefore, we should optimize the multiplication process to skip these zero elements.

### Approach

1. **Understand Sparse Matrices**: Sparse matrices contain a lot of zero values. Storing and processing only non-zero elements can save memory and computation time.

2. **Matrix Multiplication Basics**: The element at position (i, j) in the resulting matrix is the dot product of the i-th row of the first matrix and the j-th column of the second matrix.

3. **Optimization for Sparsity**: To optimize, we will only consider non-zero elements in both matrices during the multiplication process.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Iterate through each row of the first matrix.
   - For each row in the first matrix, iterate through each column of the second matrix.
   - For each pair (row, column), compute the dot product by iterating through the common dimension (k), but only consider positions where both matrices have non-zero elements.

We'll approach this problem step by step, ensuring that we understand the requirements and constraints.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We know that the sequence of super ugly numbers starts with 1 (since 1 has no prime factors, which trivially satisfies the condition).
   - We need to generate the sequence up to the nth super ugly number.

2. **Generating Super Ugly Numbers**:
   - We will use a min-heap (priority queue) to efficiently find the next smallest super ugly number.
   - For each prime in the given list, we will keep track of the current index in the super ugly numbers sequence that we have multiplied this prime with.
   - Initially, all indices are set to 0, pointing to the first super ugly number, which is 1.

3. **Building the Sequence**:
   - We will iterate n times to build the sequence up to the nth super ugly number.
   - In each iteration, for each prime, we calculate the product of the prime and the super ugly number at the current index for that prime.
   - We pick the smallest among these products to be the next super ugly number and add it to our sequence.
   - We then update the index for the prime that generated this smallest product.

4. **Avoiding Duplicates**:
   - To avoid adding duplicates to our sequence, we need to ensure that we only add a number once, even if it can be generated by multiple primes.
   - This is handled by the min-heap, which ensures that we always pick the smallest possible next super ugly number.

For the binary tree vertical order traversal problem, we need to traverse the tree in a way that groups nodes based on their vertical columns. Nodes that are directly above or below each other in the tree structure should be in the same vertical column.

To solve this, we can perform a BFS (Breadth-First Search) traversal while keeping track of the horizontal distance from the root for each node. We'll assign a horizontal distance to each node, where the root has a horizontal distance of 0. Left children will have a horizontal distance one less than their parent, and right children will have a horizontal distance one more than their parent.

As we traverse the tree level by level, we'll store nodes in a map where the key is the horizontal distance and the value is a list of nodes at that distance. After traversing the entire tree, we can collect the nodes from the map in order of their horizontal distances to get the vertical order traversal.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Initialize a queue** for BFS, where each element is a tuple containing a node and its horizontal distance.
2. **Initialize a map** (dictionary) to store lists of nodes indexed by their horizontal distances.
3. **Enqueue the root node with horizontal distance 0**.
4. **Perform BFS**:
   - Dequeue a node and its horizontal distance.
   - Add the node's value to the corresponding list in the map based on its horizontal distance.
   - Enqueue the left child with horizontal distance decremented by 1.
   - Enqueue the right child with horizontal distance incremented by 1.
5. **Collect the results** from the map in order of horizontal distances.

This approach ensures that nodes are grouped by their vertical columns and ordered from top to bottom within each column, respecting the left-to-right order for nodes at the same position.
