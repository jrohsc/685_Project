Easy,"Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,7,11,15\], target = 9
**Output:** \[0,1\]
**Explanation:** Because nums\[0\] + nums\[1\] == 9, we return \[0, 1\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,4\], target = 6
**Output:** \[1,2\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,3\], target = 6
**Output:** \[0,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `-109 <= target <= 109`
*   **Only one valid answer exists.**

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?","
    ```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in map:
            return [map[complement], i]
        map[num] = i
    return []
```
    
    The algorithm leverages a hash map (unordered_map in C++, HashMap in Java, dictionary in Python, and Map in JavaScript). It iterates through the given 'nums' array and calculates the complementary value (target - current value). If the complementary value is already in the hash map, it means that we found a solution, and we return those indices. If the complement is not in the hash map, we store the current element in the hash map with its index. If the algorithm doesn't find the solution, it returns an empty array or throws an exception (in Java).

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n) as well.

1. Initialize left and right pointers to the start of the string, and maxLength to 0.
2. Check if the character at the right index is in the set.
   - If it's not in the set, add the character to the set, update maxLength, and move the right pointer forward.
   - If it's in the set, remove the character at the left index from the set, and move the left pointer forward.
3. Repeat step 2 until the right pointer reaches the end of the string.

If the current characters in `s` and `p` are equal or `p` has a '.', we update the `dp[i][j]` to the value `dp[i - 1][j - 1]`, because the match continues.

If the current character in `p` is '*', we have two options:

1. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as 0 occurrences. We update the `dp[i][j]` value to `dp[i][j - 2]`.
2. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as at least 1 occurrence. We update `dp[i][j]` to the value of `dp[i - 1][j] && (s[i - 1] == p[j - 2] || p[j - 2] == '.')`.

It calculates the area between these two lines and updates the maximum area if the current area is larger than the previously calculated maximum area. If the height at the left pointer is less than the height at the right pointer, it moves the left pointer to the right. Otherwise, it moves the right pointer to the left. The algorithm continues until the pointers meet.

This algorithm ensures that the maximum area is found without having to check all possible pairs of lines because it always chooses the pair of lines with the maximum possible distance and minimum height difference at each step.

To do this, we add to the total the current value minus 2 times the previous value. Finally, the previous value is updated, and the loop continues.

    The algorithm uses a stack data structure to check the validity of the input string. It iterates through the string one character at a time. When an open bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. When a close bracket is encountered, the algorithm checks if the stack is empty or the corresponding open bracket is not at the top of the stack. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns false. If not, the open bracket is popped from the stack. After iterating through the entire string, the function checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is not empty, the function returns false, indicating there were unmatched open braces.

Easy,"You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists in a one **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return _the head of the merged linked list_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** list1 = \[1,2,4\], list2 = \[1,3,4\]
**Output:** \[1,1,2,3,4,4\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** list1 = \[\], list2 = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** list1 = \[\], list2 = \[0\]
**Output:** \[0\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.","

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
         
def merge_two_lists(list1, list2):
    if list1 is None:
        return list2
    if list2 is None:
        return list1

    if list1.val < list2.val:
        list1.next = merge_two_lists(list1.next, list2)
        return list1
    else:
        list2.next = merge_two_lists(list1, list2.next)
        return list2
```
    
    The algorithm is a recursive solution:
1. If either `list1` or `list2` is null, return the other list as the result.
2. Compare the values of the nodes in `list1` and `list2`.
3. If `list1` node value is smaller, set `list1.next` to the result of recursively calling the function with `list1.next` and `list2`.
4. Otherwise, set `list2.next` to the result of recursively calling the function with `list1` and `list2.next`.
5. Return the current node as the new head of the merged list.

This process is repeated until one of the lists becomes null, then the other list is returned as the remainder of the merged list.

Please note that each language has some differences in syntax, like defining a class in Python or using the `nullptr` keyword in C++. However, the core logic of the solution remains the same for all languages.

Medium,"Given `n` pairs of parentheses, write a function to _generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3

    ```python
def generate_parenthesis(n):
    def generate_parenthesis_helper(open, close, current):
        if open == 0 and close == 0:
            result.append(current)
            return
        if open > 0:
            generate_parenthesis_helper(open - 1, close + 1, current + '(')
        if close > 0:
            generate_parenthesis_helper(open, close - 1, current + ')')

    result = []
    generate_parenthesis_helper(n, 0, '')
    return result
```

    
    The algorithm uses a helper function called `generateParenthesisHelper` which receives four parameters: the number of open parentheses left to place, the number of close parentheses left to place, the current string that holds the generated parentheses so far, and the result list to store valid combinations.

The algorithm uses a depth-first search to construct valid combinations of parentheses. It starts with `n` open parentheses and increments the number of close parentheses as it places an open parenthesis. When the helper function has no open or close parentheses left to place, it means a valid combination is found, so it adds the combination to the result list.

The helper function recursively calls itself. If there are open parentheses left to place, it calls itself with one less open parenthesis and one more close parenthesis. If there are close parentheses left to place, it calls itself without changing the number of open parentheses and with one less close parenthesis. Finally, the current string in each case is updated with the placed open or close parenthesis.
    ","Given `n` pairs of parentheses, write a function to _generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses_.

    The algorithm follows a divide and conquer approach to merge all linked lists into one sorted linked-list. 

1. If the given array of linked-lists is empty, we return a null pointer.
2. The main function `mergeKLists` merges the first two lists in the array of linked-lists and appends the results (merged list) at the end of the array. It will then remove the merged lists from the beginning of the array. This process is repeated until only one linked-list remains in the array.
3. The function `merge2Lists` is used for merging two sorted linked-lists. The smallest element of the two lists is chosen as the head node and recursively merged with the rest of the lists.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(kN) and a space complexity of O(1), where k is the number of linked-lists, and N is the total number of nodes across all linked-lists.

Then, it sets the current head's next node to the second node and returns the second node as the new head of the pair. As the recursion unfolds, the pairs get swapped, and the final swapped linked list head is returned.

    1. Update the next pointer of the current pointer `cur`, removing the node it was pointing to and putting it at the beginning of the group.
    2. Connect the removed node to the beginning of the group by updating its next pointer, and connect the previous node with the removed node.
5. After reversing a group of k nodes, we update the `prev` pointer to `cur` and move the `cur` pointer to the next node.
6. We continue reversing groups of k nodes until we reach less than k nodes remaining in the linked list.

    The algorithm uses two pointers approach. The pointer `i` maintains the position where the next non-val element should be placed, and pointer `j` iterates through the array. If the element at `j` is not equal to `val`, we place it at the position `i` and increment the `i` pointer. The loop continues until we have checked all the elements in the array. The `i` pointer will give us the count of elements that are not equal to `val`, which is the result. Thus, we return the value of `i` as the final result.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, as we only iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) since we do not use any extra memory. We modify the input array in-place.

    The algorithm searches for the first occurrence of the `needle` string in the `haystack` string. First, it checks if the `needle` is empty, and if it is, it returns 0. Otherwise, it uses the built-in `find`, `indexOf` or `index` functions provided by the corresponding language's string data type. These functions return the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring. If the substring is not found, they return specific values like string::npos for C++, -1 for Java, and raise a ValueError exception for Python. Depending on the returned value, the algorithm either returns the index of the first occurrence or -1, indicating that `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

Medium,"Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide two integers **without** using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, `8.345` would be truncated to `8`, and `-2.7335` would be truncated to `-2`.

Return _the **quotient** after dividing_ `dividend` _by_ `divisor`.

**Note:** Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the **32-bit** signed integer range: `[-231, 231 - 1]`.

    1. First, we handle the edge case where dividend = -2^31 and divisor = -1. The result must be 2^31, but since it's out of the signed integer range, we should return 2^31 - 1.
2. Calculate the sign of the result based on the signs of dividend and divisor.
3. We use the bitwise shift operator to handle divisions by powers of 2. In each iteration, we initialize the temp variable as the absolute value of the divisor to calculate how many times it fits into the remaining dividend. We then use another loop to repeatedly double the temp variable (by bitwise left shift) and check if the dividend is still greater or equal. If so, we also double the 'multiple' value associated with temp, as that's the actual quotient in the current iteration.
4. When the shifting loop exits, we subtract the current temp from dividend and accumulate the current multiple to our answer.
5. Once the dividend is less than the divisor, we break the loop and return the signed quotient by multiplying the sign variable to our answer.

    The algorithm is a variation of binary search. The main idea is to decide whether the target is in the left or the right half of the current subarray. If nums[mid] >= nums[left], the left half is sorted. If target is in the range [nums[left], nums[mid]), set right = mid - 1. Otherwise, set left = mid + 1. If nums[mid] < nums[left], the right half must be sorted. If target is in the range (nums[mid], nums[right]], set left = mid + 1. Otherwise, set right = mid - 1. Continue the process until the target is found or the subarray is empty, in which case return -1. This algorithm has a runtime complexity of O(log n) because it eliminates half of the remaining elements at each step, similar to a binary search.

    The given problem requires a binary search algorithm. We define two pointers, `left` and `right`, initially set to the first and last index of the array. We then enter a loop that continues as long as left is less than or equal to right. Inside the loop, we calculate the middle index, `mid`, as the average of left and right. If the value at this middle index is equal to the target value, we return the middle index. If the middle value is less than the target value, we set left to `mid + 1`, meaning we search the right half of the remaining array. If the middle value is greater than the target value, we set the right to `mid - 1`, meaning we search the left half of the remaining array. After the loop, if the target value is not found, we return the value of the left pointer, which represents the index where the target value should be inserted.

    1. The algorithm starts by searching for an empty cell (denoted by '.').
2. Once an empty cell is found, it tries to insert a number from 1 to 9.
3. For each inserted number, it checks if its placement is valid based on Sudoku rules:
   - The number must not be present in the same row or column.
   - The number must not be present in its corresponding 3x3 grid.
4. It calls itself (backtracks) recursively whenever a valid number is inserted into the cell.
5. If inserting a number fails to lead to a valid solution, the algorithm reverts that cell to '.' and tries the next number.
6. The process is repeated until a valid board is created or all possibilities have failed.
7. Once an empty cell is not found, it considers the board solved and exits the process.
    ","Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy **all of the following rules**:

1.  Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each row.
2.  Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each column.
3.  Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid.

The `'.'` character indicates empty cells.

In other cases, it makes a recursive call to the function with `n-1` to get the previous term in the sequence. Then it iterates through the previous term, comparing each character with the previous one to count the number of consecutive equal digits. When it encounters a different character, it appends the count and the character to the result string and resets the count to 1.

    The algorithm is a recursive backtracking algorithm. We define a helper function `findCombinations` that takes the following parameters:

1. `startIndex`: the index of the candidates array from which it can start choosing numbers.
2. `remaining`: the remaining sum needed to reach the target.

The base cases are:
- If `remaining` is 0, it means we have found a valid combination, so we return a list containing an empty list.
- If `startIndex` is equal to the length of candidates, or `remaining` is negative, there are no valid combinations, so we return an empty list.

In the function, we first initialize an empty list called `result`. Then, we make two recursive calls to `findCombinations`:

1. Excluding the current candidate at `startIndex` and incrementing `startIndex`, to search for combinations without this candidate.
2. Including the current candidate in the combination, and decreasing `remaining` accordingly (without updating `startIndex`).

After getting results from both recursive calls, we merge them and return the final list of combinations.

The main function `combinationSum` calls `findCombinations` with `startIndex` as 0 and `remaining` as the target, and returns the result after the recursion is done.

    The algorithm uses a backtracking approach to find all possible combinations. It starts by sorting the input `candidates` array/list. Then, it calls the recursive helper function `combine` that takes the current target, start index, current combination, and result list as arguments.

1. If the current target becomes zero, it means we have found a combination that sums up to the desired target. Add the current combination to the result list and return.
2. Iterate through the `candidates` list starting from the given index.
   - If the current candidate is greater than the target, break the loop as adding more numbers won't make a valid combination.
   - Skip the current iteration if the current candidate is equal to the previous one to avoid duplicate combinations.
   - Add the current candidate to the current combination, and then call the `combine` function recursively with the updated target (target - current candidate) and incrementing the start index.
   - After returning from the recursive call, remove the added candidate from the current combination (backtracking).

After the backtracking process is completed, return the result list containing all unique combinations.

    The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach, initializing left and right pointers to the beginning and end of the elevation map, respectively. It also initializes two variables `maxLeft` and `maxRight` to keep track of the maximum heights on the left and right of the pointers, as well as a variable `water` to store the trapped water.

The algorithm iterates through the elevation map until the left pointer is less than the right pointer. In each iteration, it compares the values at both pointers to determine which side is shorter. If the value at the left pointer is less than or equal to the value at the right pointer, it means water can be trapped on the left side up to the height of the shorter bar. The algorithm updates `maxLeft` with the maximum height on the left side and then adds the trapped water (which is the difference between the maximum height and the current height) to the `water` variable. The left pointer is then incremented. If the value at the right pointer is smaller, the same logic is applied to the right side and the right pointer is decremented.

This process is repeated until the left pointer is no longer less than the right pointer, at which point the total trapped water has been calculated and the `water` variable is returned. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) as it only uses constant extra space.

Then, for each recursive backtracking call, we swap the elements in the range `[start, len(nums) - 1]` with `nums[start]`, ignoring already-visited elements by using a `visited` array.

We also skip any element that is equal to the current `start` element to avoid duplicates. After generating a valid permutation by iterating through all indices, we append the current permutation to the result array. When backtracking, we maintain the original order of elements before moving to the next level.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n! * n) since there are n! available permutations and each permutation requires O(n) time to build the solution. The space complexity is O(n) to store the `visited` array and temporary lists.

    The algorithm iterates over each layer of the matrix gradually working inwards. For each element in the current layer, it performs a 4-way swap (moving elements from left -> top, bottom -> left, right -> bottom, and top -> right). This moves each element in the layer to its new position after rotation without using any additional memory. The algorithm proceeds with this strategy until it reaches the center of the matrix, ensuring that all elements are correctly rotated.

    The algorithm iterates through the input array of strings. For each string, create a sorted version of the string as key, and store the original strings as values. Use a data structure like a map or dictionary to store the grouped anagrams in these key-value pairs. The keys will represent the different anagrams, while the values will be lists of the original strings that fit the anagram. Finally, extract the values (lists of anagrams) from the map or dictionary and return them. This works because anagrams will produce the same sorted strings as keys.

    The algorithm uses the binary exponentiation technique, which is a faster method of calculating x^n compared to the naive approach. It relies on the process of repeatedly multiplying the current product by itself and updating it after each iteration. The loop iterates through the bits of the exponent n, from the least significant to the most significant. If the current bit of n is 1, the result is multiplied by the current product. At the end of the loop, the current product is updated by squaring it. This process continues until all bits of the exponent have been processed.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log(n)) because the loop iterates through the bits of n, and the number of bits in n is proportional to the logarithm of n. The space complexity is O(1), as the space used by the temporary variables does not depend on the size of n.

    The algorithm uses the backtracking approach to solve the N-Queens puzzle. The idea is to place queens one by one in different columns, starting from the leftmost column. When placing a queen, check if that position is safe from all previously placed queens in terms of the horizontal, diagonal, and anti-diagonal directions. If the selected position is safe, move on to the next column and try to place another queen there. If no safe positions are found in the current column, then go back to the previous column and move the queen to another safe position. Repeat this process until all queens are placed in a valid configuration or all possible arrangements have been tried. During the process, whenever we successfully place `n` queens on the board, add that configuration to our result list. Finally, return the list of all unique solutions found.

    The algorithm recursively places queens on columns and checks if the placement is safe, i.e., no queens are attacking each other. 
1. Maintain an array `cols` storing the row indices of placed queens. The index in this array represents the column the queen is placed in. This ensures that no two queens are placed in the same column.
2. Recursively place queens (column-wise).
3. Check for a safe position for each queen in the current column:
   a. Check for same row (`cols[i] == row`).
   b. Check for diagonal attack (`abs(i - col) == abs(cols[i] - row)`).
4. If the current position is safe, place the queen in the current column at the current row position, and continue to place the next queen.
5. If all queens are placed, increment the solution count.
6. If the recursive call finishes, backtrack by removing the queen from the current column and move on to the next row in the same column.
7. The base case is when the `cols` size equals `n`, meaning all queens have been placed safely; increment the count.

This approach considers all possible configurations for placing the n queens while avoiding visiting invalid configurations. It uses backtracking to explore the state space efficiently. The algorithm finds the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

    The algorithm first finds the length of the linked list by iterating through it. It then calculates the actual number of rotations needed, considering that if `k` is equal to or larger than the length of the linked list, the same rotation will be repeated. To minimize the rotations, we find the remainder of `k` divided by the length of the list.

Next, we connect the tail of the linked list to the head, forming a circular linked list. Following this, we iterate again through the list and perform the rotations by updating the pointers of the new head and tail. Finally, we break the cycle in the list and return the new head.

    The idea is to use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We create a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `m` x `n` to store the number of unique paths to reach each cell in the grid.

Initially, we fill out the first row and first column of the `dp` array with 1 since there is only one way to reach any cell in the first row or first column: by moving either right along the first row or down along the first column.

Then, for every other cell in the `dp` array, we can calculate the number of unique paths to that cell by summing the number of unique paths to the cell above it and to the cell to its left. We can do this because the robot can only move down or right, so the paths to the current cell must have come from those two directions.

Finally, we return the value at the bottom-right corner of the `dp` array, which represents the number of unique paths the robot can take to reach the destination.

Hard,"Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

**Explanation:** Note that the last line is  ""shall be     "" instead of  ""shall     be "", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.

2. Use `idx` to keep track of the start of the line. `idx` initially starts at 0, i.e., the first word.
3. Calculate the total number of characters from `idx` to the last word in a line by testing whether adding the next word, with an extra space before it, would exceed `maxWidth`.
4. Find the number of gaps in the current line. If it is the last line or there is only one word, left-justify the words and pad the remaining space with spaces.
5. If it's not the last line, distribute spaces as evenly as possible between words: calculate `evenSpaces` and `extraSpaces`, and add an extra space to the left gaps until there are no more `extraSpaces`.
6. Append the constructed line to the result list and update the `idx` to the start of the next line.
7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 until reaching the last word.

    The algorithm used is dynamic programming. We create a 2D table dp with dimensions (m+1) x (n+1), where m is the length of word1 and n is the length of word2. Each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to convert word1[0...i-1] to word2[0...j-1].

For each cell, we have the following conditions:
1. If either i or j is 0, it means one of the strings is empty, so the minimum number of operations needed is the length of the non-empty string (i or j).
2. If the current characters of the two strings are equal (word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]), we don't have to do anything, so dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1].
3. If the current characters are different, we take the minimum of the following and add 1:
    a. dp[i-1][j]: Delete operation
    b. dp[i][j-1]: Insert operation
    c. dp[i-1][j-1]: Replace operation

After filling the table, the minimum number of operations will be at dp[m][n].
    ","Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return _the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`_.

Firstly, the number of rows and columns (m and n) are computed. Then, we initialize the left and right pointers (l and r).

In each step of the binary search, we calculate the middle index (mid) and get the corresponding value (mid_val) in the matrix. To get the value in the matrix, we divide mid by n and take the remainder.

We then compare the mid_val with the target. If it is equal to the target, we return true. If it's less than the target, we move the left pointer to the next position (mid + 1). Otherwise, we move the right pointer (mid - 1).

    The algorithm can be explained using three pointers: `red`, `white`, and `blue`. `red` is responsible for tracking the position where the next 0 should be moved to, starting from the beginning of the array. Likewise, `blue` is responsible for tracking the position where the next 2 should be swapped to, starting from the end of the array. `white` is responsible for iterating through the array.

While `white` is less than or equal to `blue`, check the current `nums[white]` value. If it is 0, swap it with the value at index `red`, and increment both `red` and `white`. If it is 1, simply increment `white`. If it is 2, swap the value at index `white` with the value at index `blue`, and decrement `blue` without incrementing `white` since the newly swapped value at index `white` might be 0 or 2.

This will sort the colors in the required order with a linear-time complexity, as we only go through the array once with the `white` pointer. Also, it sorts the colors in-place without the need for additional storage.

4. Check the validity by comparing `valid` with the length of `t`.
    - If valid, update the answer substring's `start` and `length` if the current window's length is less than the current minimum.
    - Then, increment the `left` pointer to slide the window until the current character count in the window goes below the count in `need`. Update the `valid` counter accordingly.

Otherwise, we iterate through the numbers from the start index to n, add the current number to the current combination, and make a recursive call with an incremented start index.

If either of these conditions are true, we place the current element at index `i` and increment `i`.

Inside the loop, we first calculate the middle index `mid` using the `left` and `right` pointers. If the middle element of the array is equal to the target, we return true, indicating that the target is found.

If the middle element is equal to the left element, we increment the `left` pointer. If the middle element is greater than the left element, we check if the target is within the left and middle elements. If it is, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one. Otherwise, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one.

If the middle element is still smaller than the left element, we then check if the target is within the middle and right elements. If it is, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one. Otherwise, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one.

    The algorithm uses a dummy node to simplify the handling of the head node of the linked list. We declare two pointers: `prev` and `curr` which are pointers to the previous and current nodes, respectively. 

The algorithm iterates through the list with the current pointer. If the current node's value is equal to the next node's value, we continue moving the current pointer along the duplicate values. Once we reach the end of duplicates, we check if the previous node's next pointer is pointing to the current node. If it is, it means there were no duplicates (prev and curr are consecutive), so we move the `prev` pointer to the current node. Otherwise, we set `prev.next` to `curr.next` to skip the duplicates. 

Finally, we move the current pointer to the next node, and repeat the process. The resulting list will have all duplicates removed, and the changes will persist as the dummy node is used to reference the head of the modified list.

    The algorithm to delete all duplicates in a sorted linked list simply iterates through the list and compares the value of the current node with the value of the next. If both values are the same, it means that there is a duplicate, so the current node's ""next"" pointer is updated to point to the node after the duplicate. If the values are different, the algorithm continues iterating to the next node. The process continues until reaching the end of the list. Since the linked list is already sorted, this algorithm guarantees that duplicates will appear consecutively, allowing for their removal in linear time.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) as it iterates through the heights only once, resulting in optimal performance.

    The algorithm first sorts the given array, and then it generates all possible subsets. For each subset, it checks if it already exists in the result set. If not, it adds the subset to the result set.

The algorithm uses a backtracking approach. It starts with an empty subset and iteratively adds elements from the input array to the subset. It keeps track of the starting index to avoid creating duplicate subsets.

In the C++ and Java implementations, a `set` data structure is used to store unique subsets. In the Python implementation, Python's `set` is used along with itertools' `combinations` function to achieve the same result. In the JavaScript implementation, a `Set` object is used, but as it doesn't handle array comparisons properly, each subset is converted into a JSON string to compare the string representation of subsets.

At the end, the function returns the result set, converted into the desired format (list of lists or vector of vectors).

Initialize `dp[0]` to 1 because there is always one way to decode an empty string.

For each character in the string `s`, consider its corresponding one-digit and two-digits representations. If the one-digit representation is valid (>=1), we can increment `dp[i]` by `dp[i-1]`, which means one more way to decode the string by using the one-digit representation of the current character. If the two-digits representation is valid (>=10 and <=26), we can increment `dp[i]` by `dp[i-2]`, meaning one way to decode the string by using the two-digits representation of the current character.

After we finished iterating through the string `s`, `dp[n]` will store the number of ways to decode the entire string.

We then call the dfs function recursively, with the current index incremented by one, the current IP appended with the current character and a dot, and incrementing part by 1. If the current number is 0 (which indicates a leading zero), we also break the iteration.

    The algorithm is a recursive one. It starts by iterating from `start` to `end`. For every value `i`, it generates left and right subtrees by calling itself recursively with the modified start and end values,  i.e., `generateTrees(start, i - 1)` for the left subtree and `generateTrees(i + 1, end)` for the right subtree. It then creates new nodes with the value `i` and combinations of left and right subtrees, adding the newly created nodes to the `trees` list.

Finally, the function returns the list of trees when the recursive calls end.

    The algorithm follows a simple recursive approach to determine if a given binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST). The key idea is to maintain a range for each node, which is defined by the minimum and maximum values that the node's value should be within. For example, the root node's value should be in the range of (-Infinity, Infinity). When traversing to the left child, the maximum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value, and for traversing to the right child, the minimum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value. The algorithm continues recursively in this manner.

A helper function, `isValidBSTHelper`, is defined and initialized with the root and the range (-Infinity, Infinity). If the node is `null`, it means that we have reached a leaf node and it should return `true`. If the value of the node is not within the specified range, it means that the node does not meet the BST requirement and the helper function should return `false`. If the node is valid, then the helper function proceeds to check for valid BSTs in its left and right subtrees with the updated range.

The base cases for this helper function are when both nodes are null, in which case the function should return true, or when one of the nodes is null, in which case the function should return false.

The function then checks whether the values of both nodes are equal and continues to call itself recursively, but with the arguments changed to evaluate the left subtree and right subtree symmetrically. If the left and right subtrees have symmetric nodes, the function will return true; otherwise, it will return false.

The recursive calls in the helper function flip the direction of traversal for both subtrees to ensure that the subtrees are compared symmetrically. In each recursive call, the appropriate child nodes are visited in opposite directions to make sure they can be properly compared.

    The algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) on both the preorder and inorder traversal results. This algorithm iteratively breaks the inorder sequence into left and right subtrees using the preorder array. The basic idea is that the first element of preorder traversal will always be the root of the tree. Then, we can find that root node's index in the inorder traversal, and create the left subtree from the elements to the left of the index, and the right subtree from the elements to the right of the index. Then we continue this process recursively.

To improve the performance of the search for the index, we can use a map (in C++, Java and JavaScript) or a dictionary (in Python) to store the indices of all elements in the inorder traversal. This way, we don't need to traverse the inorder array every time to find the index of the current element.

Since we're doing this for Python, Java, C++ and JavaScript, some data structures might look a bit different and have different functions to do the same action, but the algorithm used in all languages is the same.

- Preorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- Inorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- A map is used to store the indices for inorder traversal in C++, Java, and JavaScript, while a dictionary is used in Python.
- A helper function is used to recursively construct the tree.
- For Python and JavaScript, the scope of pre_idx is made non-local, so it does not require additional arguments.

The resulting functions return the root node of the reconstructed binary tree.

    We are given the inorder and postorder traversals of a binary tree, and the task is to reconstruct the binary tree from this information. In the postorder traversal, the last element is the root of the tree. Knowing the root, we can divide the inorder traversal into left and right subtrees. With the knowledge of the left subtree size, we can divide the postorder traversal into left and right subtrees as well. We can then recursively build the left and right subtrees, and construct the tree accordingly.

The provided solution maintains a hashmap to keep the indexes of elements in the inorder traversal for easy access during the construction. It uses a helper function `_build` to carry out the recursive construction. The `_build` function takes in the range of elements to be considered in both inorder and postorder traversals and recursively constructs the tree, by dividing the inorder and postorder ranges into left and right subtrees, using the root found in the postorder traversal.

    The algorithm for creating a height-balanced binary search tree from a sorted array can be described as follows:

1. Find the middle element of the array, and make it the root of the binary search tree.
2. For each half of the array (elements to the left of the middle element and elements to the right of the middle element), repeat step 1 recursively.
3. The base case is when the start index is greater than the end index, in which case a null node is returned.

The above code implements this algorithm in C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.

    The algorithm recursively constructs a height-balanced binary search tree from the given sorted linked list. At each recursive step, the algorithm performs the following steps:
1. Initialize slow and fast pointers at the head of the current sub-list.
2. Move the fast pointer twice as fast as the slow pointer to find the middle element of the sub-list.
3. Detach the left sub-list from the middle element.
4. Create a new tree node with the value of the middle element as root.
5. Recursively convert the left and right sub-lists into tree nodes attached as left and right children of the root.
6. Return the root node of the constructed subtree.

This process is repeated until there are no more elements left in the linked list, leading to the construction of a height-balanced binary search tree. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n*log(n)), where n is the number of nodes in the list.

    The algorithm is based on the depth-first search. In this algorithm, we define a helper function named `getHeight` which will return the height of the given subtree if it is balanced, otherwise, it will return -1.

The `getHeight` function works as follows:
1. If the current node is null, return 0 (base case).
2. Call the function recursively for the left subtree (leftHeight) and the right subtree (rightHeight).
3. If either of the subtrees is not balanced or the height difference is greater than 1, return -1.
4. Otherwise, return the maximum height of the left and right subtrees incremented by 1.

The main function `isBalanced` just calls the `getHeight` function and checks whether its result is -1 or not. If it is not -1, the binary tree is height-balanced, otherwise, it is not balanced.

```
    
    We perform a depth-first search on the tree. The base case would be an empty tree with a depth of 0.

For each non-null subtree, we recursively find the minimum depth of the left and right children. Then, we have three cases:
1. If both left and right children are null, then the current node is a leaf node, and the minimum depth is 1.
2. If either left or right child is null, we return the depth of the other child + 1.
3. If both children are non-null, we take the minimum depth of both children and add 1.

To handle all the cases in a single line, we use a ternary conditional expression in C++, Java, and JavaScript, and use the `and`-`or` short-circuit syntax in Python. We check if either left or right is 0, and in that case return left + right + 1 which handles cases 1 and 2; otherwise, we return the minimum depth of both children + 1, which handles case 3.

Then for non-leaf nodes, it checks if there exists a root-to-leaf path in the left or right subtree by recursively calling the function on the child nodes. The targetSum is updated by subtracting the value of the current node i.e., `targetSum - root.val`.

    The algorithm uses dynamic programming to count the number of distinct subsequences. The main idea is to create a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of distinct subsequences of the first `i` characters in string `s` that equal the first `j` characters in string `t`. 

The algorithm initializes the first row of the table since there are no subsequences of an empty string. Then, it iterates through each character in both strings, comparing for equality. If the characters are equal, the value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j]`. If the characters are not equal, the value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i - 1][j]`. After filling the 2D table, the value at `dp[m][n]` represents the total number of distinct subsequences of `s` that equal `t`.

The `next` pointer of the `prev` node is updated to the current node. The variable `prev` is then set to the current node. Repeat this process until the queue is empty which means we have visited all the nodes in the tree.

Next, we iterate from the second element to the (i-1)-th element of the row (i being the row index). Each element (at index j) of the row is set to the sum of the two values positioned just above it in the previous row - these values are available at (i-1, j-1) and (i-1, j) in Pascal's Triangle.

**Input:** prices = \[7,1,5,3,6,4\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

    In this problem, we use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`:

1. Create an unordered set `dict` or `word_set` with all the words from `wordList` for fast look-up, and check if it contains the `endWord`.
2. Create a queue for BFS, initialize it with `beginWord`, and initialize `steps` variable to 1.
3. Repeat the following steps while the queue is not empty:
   a) For each level of BFS, store the current level size, and create an empty set for `current_level` (only in Python & JavaScript).
   b) Iterate for each word in the current BFS level:
      - Dequeue the next `currentWord`, and check for `endWord`; if found return the current `steps` value.
      - Iterate through each character of the `currentWord`; for every character, replace it with 26 possible lowercase alphabets.
        - If the new word is in the `dict` or `word_set`, enqueue it in the queue, and remove it. In Python and JavaScript, also add it to the `current_level` set.
      - Revert the character back to the original character.
   c) Increment the `steps` value by 1, and in Python/javascript, update the `word_set` by removing words present in `current_level`.
4. If the queue is empty and no sequence is found, return 0.

    The algorithm first creates a set (or hash set) with the given array of integers called `elements`. The set will allow us to have a fast O(1) lookup on our next step.
Now we iterate through the original array of numbers, and for each number, we check if `(number - 1)` is not in the `elements` set. If it's not in the set, it means we can start counting a new consecutive sequence.
Next, we create two variables, `currentNum` and `currentSeq`, and initialize them with the current number and 1, respectively.
We then use a while loop to check if the next number (`currentNum + 1`) is in the `elements` set. If it is, we increment both `currentNum` and `currentSeq`. This process will continue, finding consecutive elements in the set, until no more consecutive elements are found.
Finally, to get the length of the longest consecutive sequence, we update the `longestSeq` variable by choosing the maximum value between itself and `currentSeq`. This will keep track of the longest consecutive sequence found so far.
The process continues until all numbers in the original array have been checked, and at the end, `longestSeq` will store the answer - the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

    The solution uses dynamic programming with an array `dp` of length `n+1` representing  the minimum cuts. `is_palindrome` is a 2D matrix that stores whether the substring from `i` to `j` of string `s` is palindromic or not.

We first initialize the `dp` array with values (i-1) for each index 'i'. This represents the maximum possible cuts needed to satisfy the condition.

Then, we iterate over the string in a nested loop. For each substring `s[i:j]`, we check if it is a palindrome. If it is a palindrome, we'll update the `dp` array with the minimum value between the current value of the `dp` array and the value of the `dp` array at `[i]` plus 1. By doing this, we are considering all possible cuts for a palindromic partition of string `s`.

Finally, we return the last element in the `dp` array, representing the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of string `s`.

```
    
    The algorithm maintains four variables: `total_gas`, `total_cost`, `start`, and `gas_tank`. We initialize these variables to 0. We then loop through each gas station and perform the following steps:

1. Add the gas at the current station to `total_gas`.
2. Add the cost of traveling from this station to the next one to `total_cost`.
3. Add the net gain/loss of gas (gas[i] - cost[i]) to `gas_tank`.
4. If the `gas_tank` is negative, update the `start` position to the next station and reset the `gas_tank` to 0.

After looping through all the gas stations, we check if `total_gas` is greater than or equal to `total_cost`. If it is, we return the `start` position, as this is the first gas station from which we can make a complete trip. If not, we return -1, because it is not possible to complete the circuit. 

This algorithm guarantees a unique solution because if there are multiple valid starting points, there must be a gas station with a lower cost to travel from it to the next station for each solution. As a result, the one with the lowest starting cost would always be chosen, ensuring uniqueness.

    In this problem, we use two variables, ones and twos, to represent the number of occurrences of each bit in the array's elements.

Initially, both ones and twos are set to 0. We use XOR (^) to count the occurrences of each bit in the array. The reason we use XOR is that it cancels out the same bits, so if a bit occurs twice, it will be 0.

We then loop through each element of the array and use XOR to count the bit occurrences. If a bit occurs for the first time, it's XORed into ones; if it occurs for the second time, it's XORed into twos. If it appears for the third time, it should be removed from both ones and twos. To achieve this, we use the bitwise AND (&) along with the bitwise NOT (~) to clear the bits that appear in twos from ones and vice versa.

Finally, after looping through all the elements of the array, the variable ones will only contain the bits that occurred once in the array, and that is our result. So we return the ones variable.

    The algorithm follows these steps:

1. Iterate through the original linked list, creating new nodes with the same value as the original nodes and insert them right after the original node in the original list. Now we have an interleaved list where each original node is followed by its copy.
2. Iterate through the interleaved list and assign the `random` pointers of the new nodes. Since the new nodes are right after their corresponding originals, we can easily set the `random` pointers for the new nodes based on the `random` pointers of the original nodes.
3. Separate the interleaved list into two separate lists - the original list and the copied list.

This algorithm creates a deep copy of the linked list with random pointers without using any extra space or data structures other than the nodes themselves. The running time complexity is O(n) as we do three separate O(n) passes through the linked list.
    ","A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` **brand new** nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. **None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list**.

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return _the head of the copied linked list_.

    The algorithm used is a combination of depth-first search with memoization. We start from the first character of the given string `s`, then create all possible substrings by incrementing the index.

For each substring, we check if it exists in the dictionary. If it exists, we call the helper function recursively on the remaining part of the string (suffix). This will give us all the possible combinations for the suffix. Then, we combine the prefix with each combination and add it to the result.

Memoization is used to store the results of the helper function for each substring encountered, so that we don't need to compute it multiple times. This speeds up the algorithm by reducing repeated computations.

Finally, we return the list of combinations where all the words are found in the dictionary.

1. If the binary tree is empty (i.e., the root is `null`), return an empty list.
2. For a non-empty binary tree with root `r`, left subtree `left`, and right subtree `right`, return a list containing:

    - `r.val`

    The idea of the algorithm is using a stack. Initially, the root node is pushed to the stack. Next, we enter a loop that ends when the stack is empty. In each iteration, we pop a node from the stack, and insert its value at the beginning of the result list (to ensure the correct order for the postorder traversal), then, push its left child, and then its right child to the stack (if they are not null). In the end, we return the result list. The algorithm is non-recursive which makes it easier to understand for some. Since the result list will store the output in reversed order, this iterative version avoids the necessity of reversing the final output.

*   `int get(int key)` Return the value of the `key` if the key exists, otherwise return `-1`.
*   `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the `key` if the `key` exists. Otherwise, add the `key-value` pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the `capacity` from this operation, **evict** the least recently used key.

    The LRU Cache data structure consists of a doubly-linked list and a hash map.

- The get operation checks if the key exists in the cache using constant-time lookup. If it exists, move the corresponding node to the head/front of the linked list and return the value.
- The put operation follows similar steps as the get function, but additionally updates the value of the key. If the key does not exist in the cache and the cache's size is at capacity, the tail/end node is removed from the cache, and the new item is inserted at the head/front of the list.

    The insertion sort algorithm for a linked list involves iterating through the list, removing one element at a time, and inserting it into the sorted sublist. We use a dummy node to act as the head of the sorted sublist, which initially has no elements. In each iteration, we compare the current element (its value) to the elements in the sorted sublist, and insert it into its proper position. This is done by updating the ""next"" pointers for the appropriate nodes. The process is repeated until all elements from the original list have been processed and added to the sorted sublist. At the end, the sorted sublist is returned, starting from the next node after the dummy head node.

    The given problem can be solved using the merge sort algorithm. First, we find the middle of the linked list using the slow and fast pointers technique. Then, we recursively split the list into two halves until we get multiple lists containing only one node. 

Next, we merge these single-node lists in a sorted manner. We compare the values of the nodes and connect the nodes accordingly to return the sorted list.

Finally, we combine the sorted lists back together to get the final sorted linked list.

In Python, we can simply use `split()` since it splits on whitespace by default and ignores leading and trailing spaces.

2. Reverse the array of words. In C++, we use the `reverse` function from the `algorithm` library. In Java, we can use `Collections.reverse()` method. In Python, we use list `reverse()` method. In JavaScript, we use the `reverse()` method on the array.

3. Join the reversed array of words into a single string with a space delimiter. In C++, we concatenate words with a space but avoid adding an extra space at the end. In Java, we use `String.join()`, in Python, use `join()` on the delimiter string, and in JavaScript, use `join()` on the array.

    The algorithm uses a binary search approach to find the minimum element in the sorted rotated array. Initially, pointers `left` and `right` are set to the start and end of the array. The midpoint `mid` is calculated as the average of `left` and `right`. The main idea is that whenever `nums[mid]` is greater than `nums[right]`, the minimum element must be in the right half of the array; otherwise, we search in the left half. This ensures that the algorithm runs in O(log n) time, as the search space is reduced by half each iteration. When `left` and `right` meet, the minimum element is found at `left`.
    ","Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

*   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
*   `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

    The overall algorithm is based on the binary search. We maintain two pointers low and high, initially set to the first and last indices of array nums. Then we perform the following steps until low is less than high:

1. Calculate mid index.
2. If nums[mid] is greater than nums[high], it means the minimum element lies in the right half of the array, so we set low to mid + 1.
3. If nums[mid] is less than nums[high], it means the minimum element lies in the left half of the array, so we set high to mid.
4. If nums[mid] is equal to nums[high], we cannot be certain in which half the minimum element lies, so we simply decrement high by 1.

At the end, the minimum element will be at index low. The solution takes O(log n) time in the average case and O(n) in the worst case.

    The MinStack class maintains two stacks - the main stack `s` (`stack` in Java, etc.) and a `minS` (`minStack` in Java, etc.) which stores the minimum elements seen so far. When an element is pushed onto the main stack, it is compared with the top element of the `minS`. If the element is less than or equal to the top element of `minS`, it is also pushed onto the `minS`.

When an element is popped from the main stack, we compare it with the top element of the `minS`. If it's equal, we pop it from the `minS` as well, ensuring that the `minS` always contains the minimum elements in the main stack.

The `top` and `getMin` methods provide constant-time access to the top element in the main stack and the minimum element in the main stack, respectively.

We make sure not to exceed the requested number of characters `n`.

sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
Assume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** file =  ""abc "", queries = \[4,1\]
**Output:** \[3,0\]
**Explanation:** The test case represents the following scenario:
File file( ""abc "");

        self.buffer_len = 0
        self.buf4 = [None] * 4

    def read(self, buf, n):
        cnt = 0
        while cnt < n:
            if self.buffer_index == self.buffer_len:

    The algorithm uses a buffer `buf4` to store characters read from the `read4` method. We initialize two variables, `buffer_index` to keep track of the current position in `buf4` and `buffer_len` to store the number of characters read from `read4`.

In the `read` method, the first step is to check if we need to read more characters from `read4`. This is done by checking if `buffer_index` is equal to `buffer_len`. If it is, then we call `read4` and reset the `buffer_index` to 0.

If the number of characters read from `read4` is 0, then we have reached the end of the file, so we break out of the loop.

Next, we copy the characters from `buf4` to the destination buffer `buf` until either we have read enough characters (`cnt` equals `n`), or there are no more characters to copy from `buf4` (`buffer_index` equals `buffer_len`). After copying characters, we increment `cnt` and `buffer_index` accordingly.

When the loop is finished, the result is the total number of characters read, which is stored in `cnt`.
    ","Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method `read` to read `n` characters. Your method `read` may be **called multiple times**.

**Method read4:**

The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

File file( ""abcde `""); // File is  ""`abcde `"", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  ""abcd "", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  ""e "", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  "" "", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

    The algorithm implements a sliding window approach. We maintain two pointers `l` and `r` representing the left and right ends of the current substring. We also maintain a hash map `char_count` to store the counts of distinct characters in the current substring.

We iterate through the string with pointer `r`. For each character, we increment its count in the hash map. If we have two or fewer distinct characters in the current substring, we update the current length `cur_len`. If we have more than two distinct characters, we move the pointer `l` to the right, decrementing the count of the character at `l` in the hash map, and removing it if its count becomes zero. We update `cur_len` accordingly in the process.

At each step, we update the maximum length `max_len` with the maximum of `max_len` and `cur_len`. We return `max_len` at the end.

Easy,"Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

*   `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
*   `listA` - The first linked list.
*   `listB` - The second linked list.
*   `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 8, listA = \[4,1,8,4,5\], listB = \[5,6,1,8,4,5\], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[4,1,8,4,5\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[5,6,1,8,4,5\]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 2, listA = \[1,9,1,2,4\], listB = \[3,2,4\], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
**Output:** Intersected at '2'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[1,9,1,2,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[3,2,4\]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = \[2,6,4\], listB = \[1,5\], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[2,6,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[1,5\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.

*   `0 <= skipA < m`
*   `0 <= skipB < n`
*   `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
*   `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

    The algorithm uses two pointers, one for each linked list head (headA and headB). The pointers traverse through the lists such that they traverse the sum of the node count of both lists. If the lists intersect at a node, the pointers will eventually meet at this intersection node because they will have traversed the same number of total nodes. If the lists do not intersect, the pointers will meet at the end of the lists, resulting in both pointers being null, and the function will return null.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,2,1,3,5,6,4\]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
*   `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.","
    ```python
def findPeakElement(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    return left
```
    
    For this problem, we can use the binary search. Instead of comparing the mid-element to the target value, we compare it with its neighbors. Based on the comparison, we adjust the left and right pointers accordingly:

1. Initialize left and right pointer, `left = 0` and `right = nums.length - 1`.
2. While `left < right`, do the following:
   a. Calculate the mid index, `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`.
   b. If `nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]`, move the left pointer to `mid + 1`.
   c. Else, move the right pointer to the `mid`.
3. When `left >= right`, the peak index is found, so return `left`.

Since we use a binary search, the algorithm runs in O(log n) time.

    The algorithm iterates over the nums array and keeps track of the previous number (initialized to lower - 1) keeping in mind that nums is a sorted unique array of elements in the range [lower, upper]. For each number, it checks the difference between the current number and the previous number. If the difference is greater or equal to 2, it adds a range to the result vector. Also, it checks whether the range length is equal to 2, in which case it will only print the starting value of the range, without the ""->"".

    The algorithm first finds the minimum and maximum values of the input array `nums`. Then it calculates the ideal bucket size by dividing the difference between the maximum and minimum values by the length of the array minus one. The algorithm then initializes an array of buckets, where each bucket contains the minimum and maximum values of its elements.

Next, the algorithm updates the minimum and maximum values for each bucket appropriately by iterating through the input array. Finally, the algorithm calculates the maximum gap by finding the difference between the minimum value of the current bucket and the maximum value of the previous non-empty bucket, and updating the maximum gap value accordingly.

This algorithm runs in linear time, because it iterates through the input array once to fill the buckets, and then it iterates through the buckets once to compute the maximum gap. It also uses linear extra space, as the number of buckets is proportional to the length of the input array.

    The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the first and last elements of the sorted array. Then, iterate until `left < right`. In each iteration, calculate the sum of the elements pointed to by `left` and `right`. If the sum equals the target, return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed). If the sum is less than the target, increment `left` to consider a larger number. If the sum is greater than the target, decrement `right` to consider a smaller number. Since the input is guaranteed to have a solution, the loop will always return a valid result. This algorithm has a constant space complexity as it does not use any additional data structures.
    ","Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already **_sorted in non-decreasing order_**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

    The algorithm converts an integer `columnNumber` to its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet. It does so by treating the Excel sheet column headers as a Base-26 number system where the numbers are represented by the characters from A-Z.

1. We start by initializing an empty string called `result` that will store the final column title.
2. In a while loop, we continue until the `columnNumber` is greater than 0.
3. We subtract 1 from `columnNumber`, as the base representation starts from A (1).
4. The remainder of `columnNumber` divided by 26 is the index of the character in the A-Z range, which is added to the `result` string.
5. `columnNumber` is then divided by 26 and the loop continues until `columnNumber` is 0.
6. Once the loop is finished, the `result` string is returned as the corresponding column title.

In the `add` method, we simply increment the count of the number in the hashmap. 

In the `find` method, we iterate through the keys of the hashmap. For each number, we calculate its complement (`value - number`). If the complement is present in the hashmap, we check two cases:
1. If `number` and `complement` are the same, we need at least two occurrences of the number in the hashmap to form a pair.
2. If `number` and `complement` are different, we have our required pair and return `true`.

    The algorithm uses dynamic programming to find the minimum health needed in a bottom-up manner by starting from the bottom-right corner of the dungeon to the top-left corner. We create a ""dp"" table with the same size as the dungeon and fill it initially with zeros. Then we iterate over each cell in the dungeon from the bottom-right to the top-left. For each cell, we consider the right and down adjacent cells (if they exist) and calculate the minimum health required to move forward. We update the ""dp"" table with these values. The minimum of the health required to move right or down, plus the current cell dungeon value, is then stored in the current cell in the ""dp"" table. Finally, we return the absolute value of the top-left cell of ""dp"" table plus one (for the initial health point). This gives us the minimum initial health needed to get to the princess.
    ","The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in **the bottom-right corner** of a `dungeon`. The `dungeon` consists of `m x n` rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in **the top-left room** and must fight his way through `dungeon` to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to `0` or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).

The process is repeated for all 32 bits, and in each step, the result variable `res` accumulates the reversed bits of the input number.

```
    
    The algorithm for this problem is straightforward. We use a bitwise AND operation with 1 to check the rightmost bit of the input integer `n`. If the result is 1, then the rightmost bit is a '1', and we increment the `count`. We continue to check the rest of the bits by shifting `n` to the right (`>>` in C++/Python or `>>>` in Java/JavaScript, since Java/JavaScript use signed right shift) to remove the rightmost bit. The loop continues until `n` becomes 0, which means there are no more '1' bits. Finally, we return the `count` of 1 bits.

Note that the '>>>=' unary operator in Java and JavaScript is used to avoid sign extension when shifting right. This ensures that the shift is done in an unsigned manner.

*   Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1.
*   Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy.

Return `true` _if_ `n` _is a happy number, and_ `false` _if not_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 19
**Output:** true
**Explanation:**
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

**Input:** n = 2

def get_next(n):
    sum = 0
    while n > 0:
        digit = n % 10
        sum += digit * digit
        n //= 10
    return sum

        slow = get_next(slow)
        fast = get_next(get_next(fast))
    return fast == 1
```
    
    The algorithm to determine if a number is happy repeatedly performs the sum of the squares of its digits. We can use the slow and fast pointer method (also called the Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm). In this method, we have two pointers (`slow` and `fast`), both initially pointing to the input number `n`. In each iteration, the `slow` pointer moves to the next number in the sequence (by calling `getNext()`) while the `fast` pointer moves to the next of next number in the sequence. If at any point, we find that the `fast` pointer becomes 1, it implies that the number is a happy number. If the `slow` and `fast` pointers become equal and it is not 1, it implies that there is a cycle and the number is not a happy number.

`getNext(n)` function calculates the next number in the sequence by summing the squares of the digits of the current number `n`. This function is called in the main `isHappy(n)` function for updating `slow` and `fast` pointers.

    The algorithm for removing elements with a specific value from a linked list involves iterating through the list and maintaining two pointers `prev` and `curr`. The `prev` pointer will point to the previous node in the list, whereas the `curr` pointer will point to the current node that is being processed.

- First, create a sentinel node to handle edge cases for the head node.
- Assign the `next` attribute of the sentinel node to the given head node.
- Set the `prev` pointer to the sentinel node and the `curr` pointer to the head node.
- Loop through the linked list:
  - If the value of the current node matches the given value, remove it by updating the `next` attribute of the previous node.
  - Otherwise, move the `prev` pointer to the current node.
  - Move the `curr` pointer to the next node.
- After the loop, the new head of the linked list is found in the sentinel node's `next` attribute.

Note that in C++, due to manual memory management, we have to delete the nodes to avoid memory leaks.

    The Trie data structure is implemented as a tree, where each node has a mapping of characters to their corresponding child nodes. Every node also has an `isEndOfWord` flag to indicate if any word ends at this node. 

The `insert` function iterates through each character in a given word, adding new nodes to the tree if they don't already exist, and finally setting the `isEndOfWord` flag to true at the final node.

The `search` function follows the characters from the root of the Trie to the final node, returning false if any character does not map to a child node, otherwise returning the value of the `isEndOfWord` flag at the final node.

The `startsWith` function is similar to `search`, but returns true if a sequence of characters exists in the Trie, regardless of whether a word terminates at the final node.

    This problem can be solved using the Topological Sort algorithm, which works in the following way:
1. Calculate the in-degree (number of incoming edges) of each node/course (use an array called `inDegree`).
2. Initialize an adjacency list, `adjList`, to store the outgoing courses from a prerequisite course.
3. Fill `adjList` while iterating through the prerequisites array.
4. Create a queue, `q`, and enqueue all the nodes whose in-degree is 0; these nodes represent the starting points in this topological sort.
5. Initialize an array or list called `order` to store the final ordering.
6. While `q` is not empty, perform the following steps:
    - Dequeue the front node `curr`.
    - Append `curr` to the `order`.
    - Iterate through all the outgoing courses (neighbors) of `curr`. For each neighboring node `next`, decrease the in-degree of `next` by 1. If the in-degree of `next` becomes 0, enqueue `next` to `q`.
7. Finally, if the length of the `order` is equal to the total number of courses, return the `order`. Otherwise, return an empty array/list, indicating that it is impossible to finish all the courses.

    We use a Trie data structure to store the words. Each Trie node has an array of child pointers for all lowercase English letters (size 26) and a boolean flag `is_word` indicating if the word ends at this node. Initially, all child pointers are set to null, and `is_word` is set to false.

When we add a word, we walk through the Trie, creating new child nodes if necessary, and set `is_word` to true for the last Trie node representing the word's last character.

When we search for a word, we use a helper function that takes the current Trie node, the word, and the current position in the word. If the current character in the word is a dot (`.`), we search for any matching character by iterating through all its children, recursively calling the helper function with the next position in the word. If the current character in the word is a lowercase letter, we proceed to the corresponding child node and continue the search.

At any point, if we reach the word's end, we check if the `is_word` of the current Trie node is true. If it is, we found a match. Otherwise, the search continues.

First, initialize two variables prev and curr to store the maximum amount obtained till the current house. Then, loop through the houses from the first to the second last, and at each step, update the maximum amount till the current house by choosing between two options: rob the current house (prev + nums[i]) or skip it (curr). Repeat the process for houses from the second to the last. Finally, return the maximum amount among both subproblems.

We keep updating the current combination and decreasing `k` and `n` accordingly as we call the helper function recursively. When we have `k = 0` and `n = 0`, we know we have reached a valid combination and add it to our result list. To prevent revisiting the same combinations, we make sure that the numbers are considered in increasing order (thus, the current value being picked always starts at `current + 1`).

When backtracking, we remove the last considered element from the current combination so that we can try another combination. Following this approach ensures that we visit every potential combination only once and store it if it is valid.

Additionally, we also create a sorted multiset (C++)/TreeSet (Java)/SortedList (Python)/SortedSet (JavaScript) of building heights, initialized with a single 0 height.

Next, we iterate through the sorted points. If the height is negative, meaning it's a left point of a building, we add the absolute value of the height to the heights set. If the height is positive, meaning it's a right point of a building, we remove the height from the heights set.

At each iteration, we compare the current maximum height to the previous maximum height. If the current maximum height is different from the previous maximum height, it means we've reached a key point in the skyline, so we add this x-coordinate and the current maximum height to the skyline result list. 

This algorithm ensures we receive a sorted list of key points in the skyline, without consecutive horizontal lines of equal height.

    The algorithm utilizes a Hashtable, in which we store the integer value present in the array as the key and its latest index position as the value. For each element in the array, we first check if the current number is already in the Hashtable. If it is, we also check if the difference between the current index and the latest index stored in the Hashtable is less than or equal to k. If both conditions are met, we return `true` because there are two repeating integers having an index difference less than or equal to k. Otherwise, we add the number along with its latest index to the Hashtable and continue with the next element. If the loop finishes without finding such a pair, we return `false`.

Note: The algorithm's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, and the space complexity is O(min(n, k)).

    In this algorithm, we maintain a sliding window of size k + 1, and use a search tree (set or TreeSet depending on the language) to store the elements within the window. We use the search tree to efficiently search for elements in the window that meet the requirement of `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= t`.

For each element in nums, we try to find a lower bound in the search tree that is close enough to the current element (within t). If there already exists an element that meets the condition, we return true.

We remove elements from the search tree that fall outside the window and add the current element to the search tree, maintaining the window size.

If we iterate through the whole array without finding a pair that meets the condition, we return false.

    The algorithm uses dynamic programming to find the largest square containing only 1's. It starts by creating a 2D table, `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the size of the largest square ending at position (i, j) in the input matrix. The dimensions of `dp` are m+1 and n+1 to accommodate zero-indexing, and all elements are initialized to zero. 

The algorithm iterates through each element in the input matrix. If the current element is 1, it sets the corresponding entry in `dp` to the minimum of the neighboring `dp` values (i.e., the values at top, left, and top-left) plus 1, which represents the size of the current square. The maxSize variable keeps track of the current largest square size, and at the end, the area of the largest square is returned by squaring maxSize.

Easy,"Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (`push`, `top`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyStack` class:

*   `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
*   `int pop()` Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
*   `int top()` Returns the element on the top of the stack.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the stack is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

*   You must use **only** standard operations of a queue, which means that only `push to back`, `peek/pop from front`, `size` and `is empty` operations are valid.
*   Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ ""MyStack "",  ""push "",  ""push "",  ""top "",  ""pop "",  ""empty ""\]
\[\[\], \[1\], \[2\], \[\], \[\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 2, 2, false\]

**Explanation**
MyStack myStack = new MyStack();
myStack.push(1);
myStack.push(2);
myStack.top(); // return 2
myStack.pop(); // return 2
myStack.empty(); // return False

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= x <= 9`
*   At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `empty`.
*   All the calls to `pop` and `top` are valid.

    We have two queues q1 and q2, where we will store the elements. For every push operation, we first push the new element into q2, then move all the elements in the q1 to q2, and then swap both queues. The pop and top operations will always operate on q1, which maintains the elements in the reverse order, simulating the LIFO order of a stack. The empty operation simply checks if q1 is empty.

The time complexity for push is O(n), while the time complexities for top, pop, and empty are O(1).

    The algorithm involves iterating through the input array and using a variable named `start` to keep track of the beginning of the current range. For each element, we compare it with the previous element to check if they form a continuous range by verifying if the current element is greater than the previous element plus 1. If they don't form a continuous range, we know that the current range has ended and a new range starts at the current element. So, we add the current range to the result in the required format and update the start variable to the current element. This process continues until all elements are processed. Finally, we add the last range to the result in the required format.

Since the input array is sorted and unique, this greedy approach ensures that we find the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array.

    The algorithm uses an iterative approach to perform an in-order traversal of the binary search tree (BST). We make use of a stack to keep track of the visited nodes. Starting with the root node, we traverse the left subtree until we reach the leftmost node, pushing each node onto the stack along the way. 

When we reach a null node, we pop the top of the stack (the leftmost node). This node will be the smallest value in the tree. We continue traversing the right subtrees, decrementing the value of k each time we pop a node from the stack. When the k becomes 0, we return the value of the current node – this is the kth smallest element.

We repeat the traversal until the desired kth smallest element is found. The time complexity is O(H + k) where H is the height of the tree.
    ","Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return _the_ `kth` _smallest value (**1-indexed**) of all the values of the nodes in the tree_.

```
    
    The algorithm checks if the given integer n is a power of two. First, we check if n is a negative number or zero, in which case it cannot be a power of two, so we return false. 

If n is positive, we can use bitwise manipulation to check if it's a power of two. A power of two in binary representation has only one bit set to 1 (e.g., 1: 001, 2: 010, 4: 100, 8: 1000). When we subtract 1 from a power of two, all the bits from the right of the set bit become 1 (e.g., 1-1: 000, 2-1: 001, 4-1: 011, 8-1: 0111). 

By performing bitwise AND operation (n & (n-1)) between n and (n-1), we can check if there is only one bit set in n. If the result is 0, that means there is no overlapping bit between n and (n-1), indicating that n is a power of two; returning true. Otherwise, return false.

    We can use two stacks(stack1 and stack2) to simulate a queue's functionality. Each time we push an element into the queue, we push it to stack1. 

When we need to pop or peek the front element, we check if stack2 is empty; if so, pop all elements from stack1 and push them to stack2. The front element of the queue then would be on the top of the stack2. If stack2 is not empty, just pop or peek the top element of stack2.

To check if the queue is empty, we just need to check if both the stacks are empty.

By doing this, we are maintaining stack2 as the reversed version of stack1, which allows us to access the elements in the correct order for a queue (FIFO).

   a. Calculates the occurrences of digit 1 contributed by the higher digits (n / divider) * i.

    The function takes in a node of the singly-linked list, which is the one to be deleted. Since we don't have access to the head of the list, we can't traverse the list to find the previous node.

The idea here is to replace the given node's value with the next node's value, and then update the given node's next pointer to skip the next node, effectively deleting the next node. Finally, we delete the next node if the language requires explicit memory management (e.g., C++).

This approach won't work if the node to be deleted is the tail of the list, but the problem statement guarantees that it won't be a tail node.

    The basic idea is to create an array `answer` with the same size as `nums`. We start by initializing all elements of the `answer` array to 1.

We then perform two passes through the `nums` array. During the first pass, we keep track of the running product of elements to the left of the current index in a variable called `left`, and we multiply the corresponding element in the `answer` array by this running product.

During the second pass, we move in the reverse direction, and we perform a similar operation for the elements to the right of the current index using a variable called `right`. This will result in `answer[i]` being equal to the product of all elements in the `nums` array except for the current element, `nums[i]`.

Since we only have two passes through the input array, the algorithm has an O(n) time complexity.

    The algorithm is a recursive divide-and-conquer approach. It starts by iterating through the `input` string and looks for operators (+, -, *). When an operator is found, the problem is divided into two sub-problems: left and right. These sub-problems are independently solved through recursively calling the `diffWaysToCompute` function with corresponding substrings. 

Each recursion returns a list of possible results for each sub-problem. For each operator, we combine these results by iterating through both lists and performing the corresponding operation (addition, subtraction, or multiplication).

If no operators are present in the input string, a base case is reached, and the current number in the input string is returned as the only result. The recursion ultimately produces a list of all possible results for the original expression by combining results from all sub-problems.

    The algorithm first checks if the two input strings have the same length. If they do not, it returns `false`, because an anagram of a string would have the same length as the original string.

Then, the algorithm initializes a hash table to store the frequency of each character in the string `s`. It iterates through the string `s`, and for each character, it increments the corresponding frequency count in the hash table.

It then iterates through the string `t`. For each character in `t`, it checks if the frequency count of that character in the hash table is greater than 0. If it is not, that means the character either wasn't in the string `s`, or has been used up already, so the function returns `false`. Otherwise, it decrements the frequency count for the current character in the hash table.

Finally, if the function has not yet returned `false`, that means that the two strings are anagrams and the function returns `true`.
    ","Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if_ `t` _is an anagram of_ `s`_, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

The shortest() function accepts word1 and word2 as input arguments. The function is responsible for calculating and returning the minimum distance between the two input words in the given array wordsDict. To achieve that, it performs the following:

1. Store the index arrays for word1 and word2 in variables `indexes1` and `indexes2`.
2. Initialize variables `i` and `j` to 0, to iterate through the index arrays and initialize `min_dist` to the maximum value possible for the programming language.
3. Perform a while loop with the condition that `i` and `j` are lesser than the length of the arrays `indexes1` and `indexes2`, respectively.
4. Calculate `abs(indexes1[i] - indexes2[j])` and compare it against the current `min_dist`. If smaller, set `min_dist` to the new minimum distance.
5. If `indexes1[i]` is lesser than `indexes2[j]`, then increment `i`, otherwise increment `j`.
6. When the loop terminates, return `min_dist` which holds the shortest distance between the two input words in the array.

    To solve this problem, we will use a recursive approach. 
We will create a helper function that takes two arguments m and n where m represents the remaining length of the number, and n represents the original length of the number. This helper function will return the strobogrammatic numbers of that length as a space-separated string.

In the helper function:

1. If m is 0, we return an empty string.
2. If m is 1, we return ""0 1 8"" representing the single-digit strobogrammatic numbers.
3. If n is 0, we return ""11 69 88 96"" representing the two-digit strobogrammatic numbers.

For each character `a` in the strobogrammatic numbers of length `m-2`:

1. If m is not equal to n, add a '0' in between the characters and concatenate to the result string.
2. Add '1', '6', '8', and '9' in between the characters, and concatenate to the result string.

Then, in the strobogrammaticInRange function, we iterate through the range of lengths from `low` to `high`. For each length, we check if the strobogrammatic number of that length is within the range `[low, high]`, and if it is, we increase the count by 1.

Finally, we return the total count of strobogrammatic numbers within the specified range.
    ","Given two strings low and high that represent two integers `low` and `high` where `low <= high`, return _the number of **strobogrammatic numbers** in the range_ `[low, high]`.

```
    
    The idea is to create a unique key for each group of strings, that depends on the relative distances between characters in a string. We iterate through the given strings and create the key for each string by taking the difference between the ASCII code of each character and that of the first character, modulo 26. We add these deltas as comma-separated elements and use them as the key in a map. Where a map is a hashmap in C++ and Java, defaultdict in Python, and Map in JavaScript. For each string, we append it to the list of strings corresponding to its group (key) in the map.

After iterating through all the strings, we return the list of groups from the map.

Note that the modulo operation and `<code>26</code>` come from the number of lowercase English letters which is 26. So, any shift greater than 25 will simply wrap around to the initial letters.

This value indicates if the current subtree (rooted at the node) is a unival subtree or not. While doing this, it also updates the count of unival subtrees encountered.

1. If the current node is `null`, it returns `true`. This means that an empty tree is considered  a unival tree.

2. We recursively call the helper function for the left and right nodes of the current node.

3. If both left and right subtrees return `true`, it means that they are both unival subtrees. Then, we check if the current node forms a unival subtree by comparing its value with the left and right child nodes when they are not `null`. If the values are the same, we increment the count and return `true` for the current node.

4. If either of the left or right subtree is not unival, we return `false` for the current node.

    The algorithm is quite straightforward. We track the indices `row` and `col` for traversal. In C++ and Java implementations, iterators are used for the same purpose.

1. In the constructor, we initialize the 2D vector and set the initial row and columns to zero.

2. In the `next()` function, we return the value corresponding to the indices (or iterators) and increment the column (or iterator) by 1.

3. In the `hasNext()` function, we check if we have a valid element and if not, we try to move forward to the next row (or iterator) and reset the column (or iterator) to 0.

We keep track of the current path, which represents the factors found so far. When `n` equals 1, we check if the current path has more than one element. If it does, we add the current combination of factors to the result.

To avoid duplicates, we ensure that the next factor in the sequence is greater than or equal to the previous one by passing a ""start"" variable in the helper function. This ensures that we always explore factors in a non-decreasing order.

At each recursive step, we first check if the current value of `n` is divisible by the current factor (i.e., it has no remainder when divided). If it is, we update the path with the current factor and call the helper function with the updated value of `n` divided by the current factor. After the recursive call returns, we remove the last factor from the path to backtrack to the previous level and explore other factors.

    The algorithm is mainly based on a stack. It processes each element in the given `preorder` array and uses the stack to keep track of nodes that are not yet part of a completed subtree.

Initially, `lower_bound` is set to the minimum possible value.

For each number in the preorder array:

1. If the number is less than lower_bound, it means the number is trying to be added as a right child but the value is less than the minimum possible value, hence breaks the binary search tree property. So return false.
   
2. If the number is greater than the top of the stack, it means the number is the right child of the last node encountered. So, we pop from the stack and set the lower_bound to the last popped value until the stack is empty or the number is smaller than the top of the stack.
   
3. Push the number onto the stack.

If no false case is encountered during the loop, return true as it is a valid preorder traversal sequence of a binary search tree.

def addDigits(num: int) -> int:

    The idea is to find the pattern for the single digit that will be the outcome of repeatedly summing up a number's digits. Observe that for numbers 1-9, the single digit outcome is the number itself. For numbers 10-18 (i.e., 1+0, 1+1, 1+2, ..., 1+8), the single digit outcome is 1-9 again. This pattern repeats.

In the given code, we return the value computed from the formula `1 + (num - 1) % 9`. The formula derives from the observation mentioned above. Here's the explanation:

- Subtracting 1 shifts the sequence to range from 0 to 8 instead of 1 to 9.
- Taking num modulo 9 reveals the repeating 0-8 pattern.
- Adding 1 offsets the range back to 1-9.

This algorithm works for all positive integer numbers, and the result is the single digit number that is the outcome of repeatedly summing up the original number's digits.

Next, we split the numbers into two groups: one group has that bit set, and the other group doesn't. XOR all numbers in both groups separately, and the result of the XOR operation for each group will be one of the unique numbers.

Then, it iterates through the count values in the hash map and checks how many characters have odd occurrences. If the string can form a palindrome, there should be at most one character having an odd number of occurrences.

The logic is based on the fact that a string can form a palindrome if it meets the following condition: If the string length is even, there should be an even number of occurrences for each character. If the string length is odd, there should be only one character having odd occurrences and the rest should have even occurrences.

    The algorithm uses the topological sorting algorithm with an adjacency list to represent the directed graph. The directed graph's vertices represent each unique character from the words array, and a directed edge between two vertices indicates that the first character appears before the second character in the alien language's dictionary.

It first initializes an adjacency list `graph`, an in-degree HashMap `inDegree` to store the in-degree of each character, and fills the HashMap with the unique characters from the words array, setting the initial in-degree of each character to 0. Then, it iterates through adjacent word pairs from the `words` array and adjacent character pairs from those word pairs, checking if they form an edge in the graph (i.e., the characters are different). If an edge is found, it is added to the graph, and the in-degree of the second character in the pair is incremented. In case we traverse through equal characters and later find the second string is shorter, we return an empty string as this indicates an invalid order.

To find the lexicographical order, we can use the topological sorting algorithm. We initialize a queue to store the characters with an in-degree of 0 (i.e. they have no incoming edges) and perform the following steps until the queue is empty:

1. Pop the front character from the queue and append it to the result string.
2. Iterate over all the neighbors of the popped character in the graph.
3. Decrement the in-degree of each neighbor.
4. Check if the in-degree of the neighbor is 0; if it is, push the character onto the queue.

Finally, if the length of the result string is less than the number of unique characters, return an empty string as it indicates there's no valid lexicographical order. Otherwise, return the result string.

    The algorithm concatenates each string with its length and a delimiter (in this case '#'). For example, [""Hello "", ""World ""] would be encoded into ""6#Hello 6#World "" (6 is the length of both ""Hello "" and ""World "").

When decoding, the receiving side searches for the delimiter and extracts the string's length just before each delimiter. It then uses that length to extract the original string extending from the position after the delimiter. It iterates over the received encoded string until all substrings have been extracted.

This algorithm works with any valid ASCII characters as it uses the length of the string in the encoding and decoding process.

    The algorithm is based on binary search. The idea is to find the pivot index 'mid' such that there are 'mid' number of elements greater than or equal to 'mid'. Since the array is sorted, we can leverage binary search by comparing the middle element's value to the number of elements on its right side (which can be calculated as 'n - mid'). If the number of elements on the right side is equal to the value at mid, we found the h-index. Otherwise, if the number of elements on the right side is less than the value at mid, we move our search to the left half of the array. If the number of elements is greater than the value at mid, we move our search to the right half of the array. This process ensures logarithmic time complexity as we eliminate half of the array in each iteration. Once our search is complete (right becomes less than left), we return the final h-index as 'n - left'.

    We start with two cases when n equals to 0 or 1.
If n equals 0, it means there are no posts, so the result will be 0.
If n equals 1, it means there is only one post and k colors to choose from, so the result will be k.

After that, we create two variables: `same` and `different`. `same` stores the number of ways to color a fence at position i, such that the color of post i is the same as that of post i-1. `different` stores the number of ways to color the post at position i, such that the color of post i is different from that of post i-1.

For the first two posts, there are k ways to paint them the same color, and k*(k-1) ways to paint them different colors.

Then we use a loop starting from the third post (i=2) to the last post (i=n-1).
At each iteration, we update `different` by adding the previous `same` and `different` values and multiply by (k-1). This is because for different colors, they can either come from previous same colors or different colors, hence the addition. And then we multiply it by (k-1) to consider all possible color combinations excluding the previous color. After that, we update `same` by the previous `different` value, because now we need to consider the current post having the same color as the previous post.

Finally, we return the total number of ways which is the sum of `same` and `different`.

Easy,"You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, bad = 4

**Explanation:**
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true

            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left
```

    
    The algorithm used here is a binary search approach which starts with the range from the first to the last version. In each iteration, it takes the middle point and checks if it's a bad version by calling `isBadVersion()` API.

If the middle version is bad, this means that the first bad version is either the middle version or somewhere on the left side of the range. So, we update the right end of the range to the middle version.

If the middle version is not bad, the first bad version must be somewhere on the right side of the range. So, we update the left end of the range to the middle version + 1.

The loop will continue until the left and right pointers converge, indicating that we have found the first bad version. As a result, we return the value of the left pointer.

This algorithm has a complexity of O(log n), as it reduces the search range by half at each iteration hence minimizing the number of calls to the API.

    The ZigzagIterator class is initialized with two vectors `v1` and `v2`. The `hasNext()` method checks whether there are any remaining elements in either vector. When the `next()` method is called, decide which vector to take the element from based on the current indices comparing to the lengths of the vectors. If there're more elements in the first vector or equal number of elements in both but the current index of the first vector is less than the current index of the second vector, we take the element from the first vector. Otherwise, we take the element from the second vector. And in every step, we move the index of the chosen vector forward. We can swap the vectors every time we decide which vector to take the element from so that the implementation can work for k > 2 vectors (cyclic order).
    ","Given two vectors of integers `v1` and `v2`, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

Implement the `ZigzagIterator` class:

*   `ZigzagIterator(List v1, List v2)` initializes the object with the two vectors `v1` and `v2`.
*   `boolean hasNext()` returns `true` if the iterator still has elements, and `false` otherwise.
*   `int next()` returns the current element of the iterator and moves the iterator to the next element.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1,2\], v2 = \[3,4,5,6\]
**Output:** \[1,3,2,4,5,6\]
**Explanation:** By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: \[1,3,2,4,5,6\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** v1 = \[1\], v2 = \[\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** v1 = \[\], v2 = \[1\]
**Output:** \[1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= v1.length, v2.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= v1.length + v2.length <= 2000`
*   `-231 <= v1[i], v2[i] <= 231 - 1`

    The algorithm is based on a backtracking approach. We initialize a helper function with the initial parameters, such as the starting position, expression, and running sum. The helper function is then called recursively for each possible operator insertion. When the position reaches the end of the input string, we check if the running sum equals the target. If it does, we add the current expression to the result.

We use these parameters in the helper function:

- `pos`: The current position in the input string
- `currVal`: The current value of the expression up until this point
- `prevVal`: The value before the last operator we inserted
- `currExpr`: The expression string that we are building up

To avoid leading zeros in operands, we use a check to terminate the loop if we encounter a zero at the start.

Inside the helper function, we iterate over the possible next positions ('i') in the input string and decide which operation to perform at the current position:

1. Base case: When the current position is 0, we simply update the current value and expression with no operator.
2. Addition: We update the current value by adding the parsed value, and append ""+"" followed by the substring to the expression.
3. Subtraction: We update the current value by subtracting the parsed value, and append ""-"" followed by the substring to the expression.
4. Multiplication: We update the current value by first subtracting the previous value, then adding the product of the previous value and the parsed value, and append ""*"" followed by the substring to the expression.

After the helper function iterates through all possibilities, we return the result as a list of expressions that evaluate to the target value.

    The PeekingIterator class implements an iterator that supports the peek operation in addition to the regular hasNext and next methods. The constructor takes an existing iterator or iterable object, and initializes the class variables for keeping track of the next value and the internal iterator.

The peek method returns the next value in the sequence, without advancing the internal iterator. The next method returns the next value in the sequence and advances the internal iterator by calling its next method. The hasNext method checks if there are more elements left in the sequence by checking if the internal iterator's next value is not the end.

In all these implementations:

- C++ implementation uses the STL iterator standards and a vector iterator as input
- Java implementation uses the Iterator interface and expects an iterator of any collection implementing Iterable
- Python implementation accepts any iterable object as the input.
- JavaScript implementation assumes given input iterable supports the iterator protocol

    The algorithm uses BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the shortest distances from empty rooms to gates. We first create a queue `q` and add all the gates' coordinates to it. Then, we create an array `directions` containing possible moves (up, down, left, right).

While the queue is not empty, we loop through all the gates in the queue, and for each gate, we explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right) and check if they are empty rooms. If they are, we update their distance to be 1 more than the current gate's distance, and add these neighbors to the queue. Once a room's distance is updated, it will not be updated again because that's the shortest distance found. The process continues until all reachable empty rooms have their distances updated.

This algorithm operates in O(m*n) time complexity, where m and n are the dimensions of the grid rooms, since each cell is visited once.
    ","You are given an `m x n` grid `rooms` initialized with these three possible values.

*   `-1` A wall or an obstacle.
*   `0` A gate.
*   `INF` Infinity means an empty room. We use the value `231 - 1 = 2147483647` to represent `INF` as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than `2147483647`.

Fill each empty room with the distance to _its nearest gate_. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with `INF`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** rooms = \[\[2147483647,-1,0,2147483647\],\[2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1\],\[2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1\],\[0,-1,2147483647,2147483647\]\]
**Output:** \[\[3,-1,0,1\],\[2,2,1,-1\],\[1,-1,2,-1\],\[0,-1,3,4\]\]

1. Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both initially pointing to the first element of the array.
2. Loop through the array, updating `slow` to point to the next element and `fast` to point to the element after the next element, until they meet.
3. Reset `slow` to the first element of the array and keep `fast` at the meeting point.
4. Loop through the array, updating `slow` and `fast` to point to the next element until they meet again. This meeting point is the duplicate number.

    The algorithm first initializes the class by storing the words into a hash map with their abbreviations as keys and a set containing the words with this abbreviation as the value. This allows for efficient lookups and eliminates duplicates in the `dictionary`.

For the `isUnique` function, the algorithm first gets the abbreviation of the `word`. Then, it checks whether the abbreviation is not present in the hash map or whether the abbreviation is present with only one word (the same as the input word) in the set. If either of these conditions is met, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

The `get_abbreviation` function returns the abbreviated version of a given `word`. If the length of the `word` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns the `word` itself; otherwise, it returns the first character, the number of characters between the first and last characters, and the last character of the `word` as a string.

    The algorithm uses a recursive depth-fisrt search approach (backtracking) for solving the string matching problem. For each character in the `pattern`, it'll check if the character exists in the `pattern_map`. If it exists and it maps to the string at the current position in `s`, it'll continue checking the remaining patterns and characters in `s`. If it doesn't exist, the function will try to create the mapping of the single character to the substring in `s`. The function will return true if a mapping is found that matches the pattern, else it'll return false. The used mapping is restored (backtracked) in each iteration.

If the current number of stones is divisible by 4, the next player can always make the other player take the last stone.

    The algorithm for solving the median in a list of integers works by maintaining two heaps, a max-heap for the left half and a min-heap for the right half. When a new number is added, it is compared to the max value of the left max-heap. If the number is smaller or equal, it is added to the left heap. If the number is larger, it is added to the right min-heap. Then, we balance the two heaps by ensuring that their sizes never differ by more than one. This ensures that the median is always easily accessible as either the largest value in the left heap or the average of the largest value in the left heap and the smallest value in the right heap. The algorithm has an O(log N) time complexity, where N is the number of elements in the list.

Hard,"Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://support.leetcode.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011883654-What-does-1-null-2-3-mean-in-binary-tree-representation-).

    The algorithm uses a Depth-First Search traversal (specifically, pre-order) to serialize the binary tree into a comma-separated string. Each empty node is represented by a ""null"" string.

To deserialize the data string back into a tree structure, the algorithm processes the comma-separated string and interprets each item it encounters. If the item is ""null"", it sets the node to null. Otherwise, it creates a TreeNode with the value and recursively sets left and right children. The deserialization also uses a pre-order traversal, which corresponds to the serialized string format. This approach ensures that the deserialized tree retains the same structure as the original tree.

    The solution is using depth-first search on the binary tree with a recursive function `longestConsecutiveSequence`. This function takes a node as input and returns the longest path of consecutive values that starts at that node. It also updates an array `longestPath` that stores the longest path seen so far, allowing multiple levels of the recursive function calls to access and update it.

For each node, the function first calls itself recursively for left and right child nodes. Then, it checks if the left and right children are consecutive values to the current value, and if so, adds the corresponding paths to `currPath`. Finally, it compares `currPath` with the maximum path found so far and updates the `longestPath` array accordingly. The longest consecutive path is returned after the recursion is complete.

After iterating through the strings, we loop through the count arrays and add the minimum of the counts of each digit in secret_count and guess_count to the cows count.

    The algorithm employs dynamic programming to solve the problem. The algorithm initializes an array `dp` of the same length as the input array `nums`, and initializes all its elements with the value 1, indicating that at least a single element can be part of the longest increasing subsequence.

Then, it employs a nested loop to iterate over the input array from the second element onwards. In the inner loop, we compare each element from the 0th index to `i-1` with the current element at `i`. If the current element is greater than the previous element, we update the `dp[i]` value by taking the maximum of the current `dp[i]` value and the `dp[j]` value of the previous element + 1, which indicates the length of the increasing subsequence.

Finally, we update the max_length variable after each outer loop by taking its maximum from the array `dp`. After completing the iterations, we return the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

Easy,"Given an integer array `nums`, handle multiple queries of the following type:

    The algorithm uses the concept of prefix-sum to answer range-sum queries efficiently. In the constructor, we iterate through the input `nums` array and build an additional `pSum` array, which stores the prefix sum for each position i, i.e., sum of all elements from index 0 to index i (inclusive) of `nums`.

The `sumRange` method is simply a matter of taking the difference between two elements in the prefix-sum array. This difference will be the sum of elements between the given `left` and `right` indices (inclusive) in the input array.

The algorithm has a time complexity of O(1) for `sumRange` queries after the O(n) pre-processing of the input array during the constructor call. The space complexity is O(n) for the `pSum` array.

    We can preprocess the matrix by creating a 2D array `dp` to store the sum of all elements in the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(i, j)` for each position `(i, j)`. For each position, we can calculate the sum using the previously computed sums: `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i - 1][j - 1] + matrix[i - 1][j - 1]`. This way, we only need to calculate the sum once for each rectangle.

After preprocessing, we can answer the query `sumRegion(row1, col1, row2, col2)` in constant time. The sum of the elements in the query rectangle can be calculated as follows: `dp[row2 + 1][col2 + 1] - dp[row1][col2 + 1] - dp[row2 + 1][col1] + dp[row1][col1]`. This is done by taking the sum of all elements in the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(row2, col2)` and then subtracting the sums of the rectangles from `(0, 0)` to `(row1 - 1, col2)` and from `(0, 0)` to `(row2, col1 - 1)`, and finally adding the sum of the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(row1 - 1, col1 - 1)` to avoid double subtraction.

    We will use a Union-Find data structure to keep track of the number of distinct islands. Initially, we set all the cells of the grid as water cells which are -1 in the `roots` array.

For each position in `positions`, let's consider it as a new land. We'll increment the island count at this point. If this cell was already processed as land, it is already in the same group or set of lands, so we just push the current island count as part of the result.

Next, we will check and merge the neighboring cells if they are lands. We iterate through 4 possible neighbors (up, down, left, and right) and find their root. If the root of the neighbor is different than the root of the current cell, we merge the sets and decrement island count.

Finally, we push the current island count after processing each position as part of the result.

The time complexity is O(k * log(mn)) as the Union-Find data structure has a log(n) time complexity for find and union operations.

A valid **additive sequence** should contain **at least** three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Given a string containing only digits, return `true` if it is an **additive number** or `false` otherwise.

**Note:** Numbers in the additive sequence **cannot** have leading zeros, so sequence `1, 2, 03` or `1, 02, 3` is invalid.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  ""112358 ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8

**Example 2:**

**Input:**  ""199100199 ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 
The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199. 
1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199

    The algorithm uses a prefix sum array to efficiently answer the range sum queries. The idea is to pre-process the input array by creating an auxiliary array prefixSum, where prefixSum[i] stores the sum of the first i elements. This allows us to compute the sum of elements in a range [left, right] in constant time, by simply returning the difference between prefixSum[right+1] and prefixSum[left]. To generate the prefixSum array, we iterate through the input array nums, and for each element, we add its value to the prefixSum array using the previous prefixSum value.

The time complexity of creating the prefixSum array is O(n) and each range sum query will take O(1) time since we just need to access and subtract two elements in the prefixSum array.

To fill `dp`, we iterate over all possible subarrays (by varying length) and calculate the optimal solution for each subarray by choosing the bursting order. For each subarray, we iterate over all balloons, bursting the `i`th balloon and taking the maximum value between the current `dp[left][right]` and the obtained coins by bursting the `i`th balloon + the coins obtained by bursting the balloons on the left of `i`th balloon + the coins obtained by bursting the balloons on the right of `i`th balloon.

Maintain an `indices` array of size `primes.length`, initialized with zeros. Each element `indices[j]` represents the index of the next super ugly number to multiply by `primes[j]`.

For each `i` from 1 to n, we calculate `ugly[i]` as the minimum of `ugly[indices[j]] * primes[j]` for all `j`. Then we increment the index `indices[j]` for which the condition `ugly[i] == ugly[indices[j]] * primes[j]` holds.

*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

**Note:** This question is the same as 1081: [https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subsequence-of-distinct-characters/](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subsequence-of-distinct-characters/) Additionally, the sky was clear that day.","python
def smallest_subsequence(s):
    # Step 1: Count the frequency of each letter in the string s
    frequency = {}
    for letter in s:
        frequency[letter] = frequency.get(letter, 0) + 1

    # Step 2: Iterate through the string s and collect each letter only once
    result = []
    seen = set()
    for letter in s:
        if letter not in seen:
            result.append(letter)
            seen.add(letter)

    # Step 3: Return the result string
    return ''.join(result)

# Example usage
s1 = ""bcabc ""
result1 = smallest_subsequence(s1)
print(result1)  # Output: ""abc""

s2 = ""cbacdcbc""
result2 = smallest_subsequence(s2)
print(result2)  # Output: ""acdb""",incorrect
