Easy,"Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,7,11,15\], target = 9
**Output:** \[0,1\]
**Explanation:** Because nums\[0\] + nums\[1\] == 9, we return \[0, 1\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,4\], target = 6
**Output:** \[1,2\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,3\], target = 6
**Output:** \[0,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `-109 <= target <= 109`
*   **Only one valid answer exists.**

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?","
    ```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in map:
            return [map[complement], i]
        map[num] = i
    return []
```
    
    The algorithm leverages a hash map (unordered_map in C++, HashMap in Java, dictionary in Python, and Map in JavaScript). It iterates through the given 'nums' array and calculates the complementary value (target - current value). If the complementary value is already in the hash map, it means that we found a solution, and we return those indices. If the complement is not in the hash map, we store the current element in the hash map with its index. If the algorithm doesn't find the solution, it returns an empty array or throws an exception (in Java).

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n) as well.

    The algorithm initializes `res` as 0. Then, we determine the sign of the input integer and take its absolute value. We use a while loop to iterate through each digit of `x` from right to left. In each iteration, we multiply the current `res` by 10 and add the last digit of `x` to it. The last digit of `x` is obtained by `x % 10`. After adding the last digit, we remove it from `x` by doing either `x /= 10` or `x //= 10`.

After processing all the digits, we adjust `res` with the sign we computed earlier. Finally, we check if the reversed integer is within the 32-bit integer range. If it is, we return the result; otherwise, we return 0.

Medium,"Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1.  Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
2.  Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
3.  Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
4.  Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `""123 "" -> 123`, `""0032 "" -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
5.  If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.
6.  Return the integer as the final result.

**Note:**

*   Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.
*   **Do not ignore** any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""42 ""
**Output:** 42
**Explanation:** The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1:  ""42 "" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2:  ""42 "" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3:  ""42 "" ( ""42 "" is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is 42.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""   -42 ""
**Output:** -42
**Explanation:**
Step 1:  ""   \-42 "" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2:  ""   \-42 "" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3:  ""   -42 "" ( ""42 "" is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is -42.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  ""4193 with words ""
**Output:** 4193
**Explanation:**
Step 1:  ""4193 with words "" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2:  ""4193 with words "" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3:  ""4193 with words "" ( ""4193 "" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.
Since 4193 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is 4193.

2. Create a variable named `original` to store the original integer value and `reversed` initialized with 0 to store the reversed integer value.
3. Iterate through the integer while it's greater than zero and, in each iteration, perform the following operations:

If the current characters in `s` and `p` are equal or `p` has a '.', we update the `dp[i][j]` to the value `dp[i - 1][j - 1]`, because the match continues.

If the current character in `p` is '*', we have two options:

1. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as 0 occurrences. We update the `dp[i][j]` value to `dp[i][j - 2]`.
2. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as at least 1 occurrence. We update `dp[i][j]` to the value of `dp[i - 1][j] && (s[i - 1] == p[j - 2] || p[j - 2] == '.')`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`.

    The algorithm uses a helper function called `generateParenthesisHelper` which receives four parameters: the number of open parentheses left to place, the number of close parentheses left to place, the current string that holds the generated parentheses so far, and the result list to store valid combinations.

The algorithm uses a depth-first search to construct valid combinations of parentheses. It starts with `n` open parentheses and increments the number of close parentheses as it places an open parenthesis. When the helper function has no open or close parentheses left to place, it means a valid combination is found, so it adds the combination to the result list.

The helper function recursively calls itself. If there are open parentheses left to place, it calls itself with one less open parenthesis and one more close parenthesis. If there are close parentheses left to place, it calls itself without changing the number of open parentheses and with one less close parenthesis. Finally, the current string in each case is updated with the placed open or close parenthesis.

1. If the given array of linked-lists is empty, we return a null pointer.
2. The main function `mergeKLists` merges the first two lists in the array of linked-lists and appends the results (merged list) at the end of the array. It will then remove the merged lists from the beginning of the array. This process is repeated until only one linked-list remains in the array.
3. The function `merge2Lists` is used for merging two sorted linked-lists. The smallest element of the two lists is chosen as the head node and recursively merged with the rest of the lists.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(kN) and a space complexity of O(1), where k is the number of linked-lists, and N is the total number of nodes across all linked-lists.

Easy,"Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm). The order of the elements may be changed. Then return _the number of elements in_ `nums` _which are not equal to_ `val`.

Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

    The algorithm uses two pointers approach. The pointer `i` maintains the position where the next non-val element should be placed, and pointer `j` iterates through the array. If the element at `j` is not equal to `val`, we place it at the position `i` and increment the `i` pointer. The loop continues until we have checked all the elements in the array. The `i` pointer will give us the count of elements that are not equal to `val`, which is the result. Thus, we return the value of `i` as the final result.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, as we only iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) since we do not use any extra memory. We modify the input array in-place.

    1. First, we handle the edge case where dividend = -2^31 and divisor = -1. The result must be 2^31, but since it's out of the signed integer range, we should return 2^31 - 1.
2. Calculate the sign of the result based on the signs of dividend and divisor.
3. We use the bitwise shift operator to handle divisions by powers of 2. In each iteration, we initialize the temp variable as the absolute value of the divisor to calculate how many times it fits into the remaining dividend. We then use another loop to repeatedly double the temp variable (by bitwise left shift) and check if the dividend is still greater or equal. If so, we also double the 'multiple' value associated with temp, as that's the actual quotient in the current iteration.
4. When the shifting loop exits, we subtract the current temp from dividend and accumulate the current multiple to our answer.
5. Once the dividend is less than the divisor, we break the loop and return the signed quotient by multiplying the sign variable to our answer.

Medium,"A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

*   For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.

    We can solve this problem by following the steps below:

1. Identify the largest index `k` such that `nums[k] < nums[k + 1]`. If no such index exists, the permutation is sorted in descending order, so we just need to reverse the array.
2. Identify the largest index `l` greater than `k` such that `nums[k] < nums[l]`.
3. Swap the value of `nums[k]` with that of `nums[l]`.
4. Reverse the sub-array `nums[k + 1:]` which is guaranteed to be in non-increasing order.

By making these changes in place and only using constant extra memory, we obtain the next permutation of the array nums.

    The algorithm is a variation of binary search. The main idea is to decide whether the target is in the left or the right half of the current subarray. If nums[mid] >= nums[left], the left half is sorted. If target is in the range [nums[left], nums[mid]), set right = mid - 1. Otherwise, set left = mid + 1. If nums[mid] < nums[left], the right half must be sorted. If target is in the range (nums[mid], nums[right]], set left = mid + 1. Otherwise, set right = mid - 1. Continue the process until the target is found or the subarray is empty, in which case return -1. This algorithm has a runtime complexity of O(log n) because it eliminates half of the remaining elements at each step, similar to a binary search.

We then enter a loop that continues as long as left is less than or equal to right. Inside the loop, we calculate the middle index, `mid`, as the average of left and right. If the value at this middle index is equal to the target value, we return the middle index. If the middle value is less than the target value, we set left to `mid + 1`, meaning we search the right half of the remaining array. If the middle value is greater than the target value, we set the right to `mid - 1`, meaning we search the left half of the remaining array. After the loop, if the target value is not found, we return the value of the left pointer, which represents the index where the target value should be inserted.

2. Once an empty cell is found, it tries to insert a number from 1 to 9.
3. For each inserted number, it checks if its placement is valid based on Sudoku rules:
   - The number must not be present in the same row or column.
   - The number must not be present in its corresponding 3x3 grid.
4. It calls itself (backtracks) recursively whenever a valid number is inserted into the cell.
5. If inserting a number fails to lead to a valid solution, the algorithm reverts that cell to '.' and tries the next number.

    The algorithm is a recursive backtracking algorithm. We define a helper function `findCombinations` that takes the following parameters:

1. `startIndex`: the index of the candidates array from which it can start choosing numbers.
2. `remaining`: the remaining sum needed to reach the target.

The base cases are:
- If `remaining` is 0, it means we have found a valid combination, so we return a list containing an empty list.
- If `startIndex` is equal to the length of candidates, or `remaining` is negative, there are no valid combinations, so we return an empty list.

In the function, we first initialize an empty list called `result`. Then, we make two recursive calls to `findCombinations`:

1. Excluding the current candidate at `startIndex` and incrementing `startIndex`, to search for combinations without this candidate.
2. Including the current candidate in the combination, and decreasing `remaining` accordingly (without updating `startIndex`).

After getting results from both recursive calls, we merge them and return the final list of combinations.

The main function `combinationSum` calls `findCombinations` with `startIndex` as 0 and `remaining` as the target, and returns the result after the recursion is done.

If not found, return the next positive integer `n + 1`.

```
    
    The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach, initializing left and right pointers to the beginning and end of the elevation map, respectively. It also initializes two variables `maxLeft` and `maxRight` to keep track of the maximum heights on the left and right of the pointers, as well as a variable `water` to store the trapped water.

The algorithm iterates through the elevation map until the left pointer is less than the right pointer. In each iteration, it compares the values at both pointers to determine which side is shorter. If the value at the left pointer is less than or equal to the value at the right pointer, it means water can be trapped on the left side up to the height of the shorter bar. The algorithm updates `maxLeft` with the maximum height on the left side and then adds the trapped water (which is the difference between the maximum height and the current height) to the `water` variable. The left pointer is then incremented. If the value at the right pointer is smaller, the same logic is applied to the right side and the right pointer is decremented.

This process is repeated until the left pointer is no longer less than the right pointer, at which point the total trapped water has been calculated and the `water` variable is returned. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) as it only uses constant extra space.

    The algorithm follows a typical multiplication method where each digit of both numbers is multiplied pairwise, with the correct position shifted as you move through the digits. Then, the products of these digits are combined to form the final result.

2. Run two nested loops for each digit of both input numbers (from right to left).
3. Calculate the product of the two digits.
4. Determine the indices to store the product values in the `pos` array, e.g., in the form of tens and units.
5. Update the `pos` array with the new product values.
6. Combine the values in the `pos` array to form the final result string.

    We use backtracking to generate permutations. Firstly, we sort the `nums` array to make sure that duplicate numbers are located together. Then, for each recursive backtracking call, we swap the elements in the range `[start, len(nums) - 1]` with `nums[start]`, ignoring already-visited elements by using a `visited` array.

We also skip any element that is equal to the current `start` element to avoid duplicates. After generating a valid permutation by iterating through all indices, we append the current permutation to the result array. When backtracking, we maintain the original order of elements before moving to the next level.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n! * n) since there are n! available permutations and each permutation requires O(n) time to build the solution. The space complexity is O(n) to store the `visited` array and temporary lists.

    The algorithm uses the binary exponentiation technique, which is a faster method of calculating x^n compared to the naive approach. It relies on the process of repeatedly multiplying the current product by itself and updating it after each iteration. The loop iterates through the bits of the exponent n, from the least significant to the most significant. If the current bit of n is 1, the result is multiplied by the current product. At the end of the loop, the current product is updated by squaring it. This process continues until all bits of the exponent have been processed.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log(n)) because the loop iterates through the bits of n, and the number of bits in n is proportional to the logarithm of n. The space complexity is O(1), as the space used by the temporary variables does not depend on the size of n.

    The algorithm uses the backtracking approach to solve the N-Queens puzzle. The idea is to place queens one by one in different columns, starting from the leftmost column. When placing a queen, check if that position is safe from all previously placed queens in terms of the horizontal, diagonal, and anti-diagonal directions. If the selected position is safe, move on to the next column and try to place another queen there. If no safe positions are found in the current column, then go back to the previous column and move the queen to another safe position. Repeat this process until all queens are placed in a valid configuration or all possible arrangements have been tried. During the process, whenever we successfully place `n` queens on the board, add that configuration to our result list. Finally, return the list of all unique solutions found.

    The algorithm recursively places queens on columns and checks if the placement is safe, i.e., no queens are attacking each other. 
1. Maintain an array `cols` storing the row indices of placed queens. The index in this array represents the column the queen is placed in. This ensures that no two queens are placed in the same column.
2. Recursively place queens (column-wise).
3. Check for a safe position for each queen in the current column:
   a. Check for same row (`cols[i] == row`).
   b. Check for diagonal attack (`abs(i - col) == abs(cols[i] - row)`).
4. If the current position is safe, place the queen in the current column at the current row position, and continue to place the next queen.
5. If all queens are placed, increment the solution count.
6. If the recursive call finishes, backtrack by removing the queen from the current column and move on to the next row in the same column.
7. The base case is when the `cols` size equals `n`, meaning all queens have been placed safely; increment the count.

    The algorithm uses the ""Kadane's Algorithm"" approach to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum. It iterates through the given array once and tracks the maximum sum found so far and the current sum.

For each element, we compare the sum of the current_sum with the element itself, and select the maximum of the two. This helps us to decide whether to continue the current contiguous subarray or start a new one from that element. Then, we compare the new current_sum with our global max_sum, and update max_sum if we find a larger value.

In the end, max_sum contains the largest sum of the contiguous subarray.

    The algorithm first finds the length of the linked list by iterating through it. It then calculates the actual number of rotations needed, considering that if `k` is equal to or larger than the length of the linked list, the same rotation will be repeated. To minimize the rotations, we find the remainder of `k` divided by the length of the list.

Next, we connect the tail of the linked list to the head, forming a circular linked list. Following this, we iterate again through the list and perform the rotations by updating the pointers of the new head and tail. Finally, we break the cycle in the list and return the new head.

    The idea is to use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We create a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `m` x `n` to store the number of unique paths to reach each cell in the grid.

Initially, we fill out the first row and first column of the `dp` array with 1 since there is only one way to reach any cell in the first row or first column: by moving either right along the first row or down along the first column.

Then, for every other cell in the `dp` array, we can calculate the number of unique paths to that cell by summing the number of unique paths to the cell above it and to the cell to its left. We can do this because the robot can only move down or right, so the paths to the current cell must have come from those two directions.

Finally, we return the value at the bottom-right corner of the `dp` array, which represents the number of unique paths the robot can take to reach the destination.

Hard,"Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

*   A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
*   Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than `0` and not exceed `maxWidth`.
*   The input array `words` contains at least one word.

**Example 1:**

**Output:**

   ""acknowledgment   "",
   ""shall be         ""
\]
**Explanation:** Note that the last line is  ""shall be     "" instead of  ""shall     be "", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = \[ ""Science "", ""is "", ""what "", ""we "", ""understand "", ""well "", ""enough "", ""to "", ""explain "", ""to "", ""a "", ""computer. "", ""Art "", ""is "", ""everything "", ""else "", ""we "", ""do ""\], maxWidth = 20

2. Use `idx` to keep track of the start of the line. `idx` initially starts at 0, i.e., the first word.
3. Calculate the total number of characters from `idx` to the last word in a line by testing whether adding the next word, with an extra space before it, would exceed `maxWidth`.
4. Find the number of gaps in the current line. If it is the last line or there is only one word, left-justify the words and pad the remaining space with spaces.
5. If it's not the last line, distribute spaces as evenly as possible between words: calculate `evenSpaces` and `extraSpaces`, and add an extra space to the left gaps until there are no more `extraSpaces`.
6. Append the constructed line to the result list and update the `idx` to the start of the next line.
7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 until reaching the last word.

    The algorithm uses binary search on an m x n matrix.

Firstly, the number of rows and columns (m and n) are computed. Then, we initialize the left and right pointers (l and r).

In each step of the binary search, we calculate the middle index (mid) and get the corresponding value (mid_val) in the matrix. To get the value in the matrix, we divide mid by n and take the remainder.

We then compare the mid_val with the target. If it is equal to the target, we return true. If it's less than the target, we move the left pointer to the next position (mid + 1). Otherwise, we move the right pointer (mid - 1).

    The algorithm can be explained using three pointers: `red`, `white`, and `blue`. `red` is responsible for tracking the position where the next 0 should be moved to, starting from the beginning of the array. Likewise, `blue` is responsible for tracking the position where the next 2 should be swapped to, starting from the end of the array. `white` is responsible for iterating through the array.

While `white` is less than or equal to `blue`, check the current `nums[white]` value. If it is 0, swap it with the value at index `red`, and increment both `red` and `white`. If it is 1, simply increment `white`. If it is 2, swap the value at index `white` with the value at index `blue`, and decrement `blue` without incrementing `white` since the newly swapped value at index `white` might be 0 or 2.

This will sort the colors in the required order with a linear-time complexity, as we only go through the array once with the `white` pointer. Also, it sorts the colors in-place without the need for additional storage.

After the call, we ""undo"" the decision by removing the number from the current combination (backtracking).

More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

For each element in the input array, we check if either `i < 2` (meaning we haven't encountered 2 unique elements yet) or the current element (`num`) is greater than the element in the array at index `i - 2` (this condition ensures that the current element appears at most twice in the array). If either of these conditions are true, we place the current element at index `i` and increment `i`. The function returns the value of `i` at the end, which represents the length of the modified array after removing duplicates.
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove some duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears **at most twice**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**. Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements. Return `k` _after placing the final result in the first_ `k` _slots of_ `nums`. Do **not** allocate extra space for another array.

    The algorithm is based on a modified binary search. We start by setting two pointers named `left` and `right` at the first and last element of the array, respectively. We then enter a loop, which continues until the `left` pointer is less than or equal to the `right` pointer.

Inside the loop, we first calculate the middle index `mid` using the `left` and `right` pointers. If the middle element of the array is equal to the target, we return true, indicating that the target is found.

If the middle element is equal to the left element, we increment the `left` pointer. If the middle element is greater than the left element, we check if the target is within the left and middle elements. If it is, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one. Otherwise, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one.

If the middle element is still smaller than the left element, we then check if the target is within the middle and right elements. If it is, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one. Otherwise, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one.

After the loop, we return false if the target is not found in the array.

    The algorithm uses a dummy node to simplify the handling of the head node of the linked list. We declare two pointers: `prev` and `curr` which are pointers to the previous and current nodes, respectively. 

The algorithm iterates through the list with the current pointer. If the current node's value is equal to the next node's value, we continue moving the current pointer along the duplicate values. Once we reach the end of duplicates, we check if the previous node's next pointer is pointing to the current node. If it is, it means there were no duplicates (prev and curr are consecutive), so we move the `prev` pointer to the current node. Otherwise, we set `prev.next` to `curr.next` to skip the duplicates. 

Finally, we move the current pointer to the next node, and repeat the process. The resulting list will have all duplicates removed, and the changes will persist as the dummy node is used to reference the head of the modified list.

    The algorithm to delete all duplicates in a sorted linked list simply iterates through the list and compares the value of the current node with the value of the next. If both values are the same, it means that there is a duplicate, so the current node's ""next"" pointer is updated to point to the node after the duplicate. If the values are different, the algorithm continues iterating to the next node. The process continues until reaching the end of the list.

Hard,"We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:

1.  If the length of the string is 1, stop.
2.  If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
    *   Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is `s`, divide it to `x` and `y` where `s = x + y`.
    *   **Randomly** decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, `s` may become `s = x + y` or `s = y + x`.
    *   Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings `x` and `y`.

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of **the same length**, return `true` if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  ""great "", s2 =  ""rgeat ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
 ""great "" -->  ""gr/eat "" // divide at random index.
 ""gr/eat "" -->  ""gr/eat "" // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
 ""gr/eat "" -->  ""g/r / e/at "" // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
 ""g/r / e/at "" -->  ""r/g / e/at "" // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
 ""r/g / e/at "" -->  ""r/g / e/ a/t "" // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide  ""at "" to  ""a/t "".
 ""r/g / e/ a/t "" -->  ""r/g / e/ a/t "" // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is  ""rgeat "" which is s2.
As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  ""abcde "", s2 =  ""caebd ""
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s1 =  ""a "", s2 =  ""a ""
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `s1.length == s2.length`
*   `1 <= s1.length <= 30`
*   `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters.","

    The algorithm works by recursively dividing the strings into smaller substrings and checking if the substrings from s1 can be rearranged into the corresponding substrings of s2. The base case is when both strings (s1, and s2) are equal. If the lengths of the strings are different or the characters are different, then the function returns false. Then, we iterate through the length of strings, dividing the strings into smaller substrings and checking if these substrings can be rearranged to form the scrambled string. We check for both possible arrangements of the substrings, i.e., same order and reverse order, invoking the same function recursively for each combination.

Easy,"You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array_ `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

Iterate in a while loop until i and j are both less than 0. Compare the values of nums1[i] and nums2[j]. If nums1[i] is greater, assign nums1[i] at position k in nums1, decrement i and k. Otherwise, assign nums2[j] at position k in nums1, and decrement j and k. This process continues for all elements in nums2.

In the C++ and Java implementations, a `set` data structure is used to store unique subsets. In the Python implementation, Python's `set` is used along with itertools' `combinations` function to achieve the same result.

    The algorithm creates a dummy node and connects it to the head of the linked list. It then iterates through the list, reversing the nodes from position `left` to `right`. It maintains pointers `pre` and `cur` to accomplish this. During each iteration, it temporarily stores the next node using a pointer `t`, then reverses the connections between the nodes.

This process is repeated for all languages; the only differences in implementation are syntax-related. 

In C++, use pointers and ""->"" to access the next node. In Java and Python, we use dot notation to access the next attribute. In JavaScript, we also use dot notation and ""==="" for equality comparison between left and right.

    We use a Depth-First Search algorithm to explore all possible configurations of the IP address. The function takes in the input string (s), the starting index (start), the partially constructed IP address (ip), and the current part count (part).

In each call to the function, we try to add one part to the IP address. If 4 parts have been added and we have reached the end of the input string, we have found a valid IP address and add it to the result list.

The algorithm iterates through the string s, starting at the current index. It keeps track of the current number (0-255) being constructed by multiplying the current number by 10 and adding the current digit. If the current number is greater than 255, we break the iteration.

We then call the dfs function recursively, with the current index incremented by one, the current IP appended with the current character and a dot, and incrementing part by 1. If the current number is 0 (which indicates a leading zero), we also break the iteration.

This process is repeated for all valid parts and combinations, eventually forming all possible valid IP addresses.

    The algorithm follows a simple recursive approach to determine if a given binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST). The key idea is to maintain a range for each node, which is defined by the minimum and maximum values that the node's value should be within. For example, the root node's value should be in the range of (-Infinity, Infinity). When traversing to the left child, the maximum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value, and for traversing to the right child, the minimum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value. The algorithm continues recursively in this manner.

A helper function, `isValidBSTHelper`, is defined and initialized with the root and the range (-Infinity, Infinity). If the node is `null`, it means that we have reached a leaf node and it should return `true`. If the value of the node is not within the specified range, it means that the node does not meet the BST requirement and the helper function should return `false`. If the node is valid, then the helper function proceeds to check for valid BSTs in its left and right subtrees with the updated range.
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, Given the `root` of a binary tree, _determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)_. A **valid BST** is defined as follows: * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key. * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key. * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. **Example 1:** **Input:** root = \[2,1,3\] **Output:** true **Example 2:** **Input:** root = \[5,1,4,null,null,3,6\] **Output:** false **Explanation:** The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4. **Constraints:** * The quantity of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`. * `-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`","python

    We will solve this problem using the Inorder traversal of the binary search tree.

1. Traverse the BST using Inorder traversal, and at each node, compare its value with the previous node.
2. If the previous node's value is greater than the current node's value, it means they are swapped. So, mark the first such node as `first` and the second such node as `second`.
3. After completing the Inorder traversal, swap the values of the `first` and `second` nodes.

The function then checks whether the values of both nodes are equal and continues to call itself recursively, but with the arguments changed to evaluate the left subtree and right subtree symmetrically. If the left and right subtrees have symmetric nodes, the function will return true; otherwise, it will return false.

The recursive calls in the helper function flip the direction of traversal for both subtrees to ensure that the subtrees are compared symmetrically. In each recursive call, the appropriate child nodes are visited in opposite directions to make sure they can be properly compared.

    The algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) on both the preorder and inorder traversal results. This algorithm iteratively breaks the inorder sequence into left and right subtrees using the preorder array. The basic idea is that the first element of preorder traversal will always be the root of the tree. Then, we can find that root node's index in the inorder traversal, and create the left subtree from the elements to the left of the index, and the right subtree from the elements to the right of the index. Then we continue this process recursively.

To improve the performance of the search for the index, we can use a map (in C++, Java and JavaScript) or a dictionary (in Python) to store the indices of all elements in the inorder traversal. This way, we don't need to traverse the inorder array every time to find the index of the current element.

Since we're doing this for Python, Java, C++ and JavaScript, some data structures might look a bit different and have different functions to do the same action, but the algorithm used in all languages is the same.

- Preorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- Inorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- A map is used to store the indices for inorder traversal in C++, Java, and JavaScript, while a dictionary is used in Python.
- A helper function is used to recursively construct the tree.
- For Python and JavaScript, the scope of pre_idx is made non-local, so it does not require additional arguments.

    We are given the inorder and postorder traversals of a binary tree, and the task is to reconstruct the binary tree from this information. In the postorder traversal, the last element is the root of the tree. Knowing the root, we can divide the inorder traversal into left and right subtrees. With the knowledge of the left subtree size, we can divide the postorder traversal into left and right subtrees as well. We can then recursively build the left and right subtrees, and construct the tree accordingly.

It uses a helper function `_build` to carry out the recursive construction. The `_build` function takes in the range of elements to be considered in both inorder and postorder traversals and recursively constructs the tree, by dividing the inorder and postorder ranges into left and right subtrees, using the root found in the postorder traversal.

3. Detach the left sub-list from the middle element.

1. If the current node is null, return 0 (base case).
2. Call the function recursively for the left subtree (leftHeight) and the right subtree (rightHeight).
3. If either of the subtrees is not balanced or the height difference is greater than 1, return -1.
4. Otherwise, return the maximum height of the left and right subtrees incremented by 1.

2. If either left or right child is null, we return the depth of the other child + 1.
3. If both children are non-null, we take the minimum depth of both children and add 1.

To handle all the cases in a single line, we use a ternary conditional expression in C++, Java, and JavaScript, and use the `and`-`or` short-circuit syntax in Python. We check if either left or right is 0, and in that case return left + right + 1 which handles cases 1 and 2; otherwise, we return the minimum depth of both children + 1, which handles case 3.

    This algorithm does a Depth First Search (DFS) traversal of the given binary tree. At each recursive call(level), the value of the current node is subtracted from the targetSum. When a leaf node is reached, the targetSum is compared with the current node value. If they are equal, then the current path of nodes is added to the result vector (ans). After traversal finishes, ans is returned which contains all the paths with the required sum.

The algorithm initializes the first row of the table since there are no subsequences of an empty string. Then, it iterates through each character in both strings, comparing for equality.

2. `maxProfit` by comparing its value with the difference between the current day's stock price and the minimum stock price encountered so far.

At the end of the iteration, the algorithm returns the value stored in `maxProfit`, which is the maximum possible profit that can be achieved.

   a) For each level of BFS, store the current level size, and create an empty set for `current_level` (only in Python & JavaScript).
   b) Iterate for each word in the current BFS level:
      - Dequeue the next `currentWord`, and check for `endWord`; if found return the current `steps` value.
      - Iterate through each character of the `currentWord`; for every character, replace it with 26 possible lowercase alphabets.
        - If the new word is in the `dict` or `word_set`, enqueue it in the queue, and remove it. In Python and JavaScript, also add it to the `current_level` set.
      - Revert the character back to the original character.
   c) Increment the `steps` value by 1, and in Python/javascript, update the `word_set` by removing words present in `current_level`.

    The algorithm first creates a set (or hash set) with the given array of integers called `elements`. The set will allow us to have a fast O(1) lookup on our next step.
Now we iterate through the original array of numbers, and for each number, we check if `(number - 1)` is not in the `elements` set. If it's not in the set, it means we can start counting a new consecutive sequence.
Next, we create two variables, `currentNum` and `currentSeq`, and initialize them with the current number and 1, respectively.
We then use a while loop to check if the next number (`currentNum + 1`) is in the `elements` set. If it is, we increment both `currentNum` and `currentSeq`. This process will continue, finding consecutive elements in the set, until no more consecutive elements are found.
Finally, to get the length of the longest consecutive sequence, we update the `longestSeq` variable by choosing the maximum value between itself and `currentSeq`. This will keep track of the longest consecutive sequence found so far.
The process continues until all numbers in the original array have been checked, and at the end, `longestSeq` will store the answer - the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

We first initialize the `dp` array with values (i-1) for each index 'i'. This represents the maximum possible cuts needed to satisfy the condition.

Then, we iterate over the string in a nested loop. For each substring `s[i:j]`, we check if it is a palindrome. If it is a palindrome, we'll update the `dp` array with the minimum value between the current value of the `dp` array and the value of the `dp` array at `[i]` plus 1. By doing this, we are considering all possible cuts for a palindromic partition of string `s`.

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

    The algorithm uses Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse the graph and make a deep copy of the nodes. Here is the algorithm:

1. Create a `visited` dictionary (C++: `unordered_map`, Java: `HashMap`, Python: `dict`, JavaScript: `Map`) to track visited nodes and keep their clones.
2. Define a recursive helper function `cloneGraph` that takes a node and the visited dictionary as input.
3. If the input node is `null`, return `null`.
4. If the input node is already in the visited dictionary, return its clone.
5. Otherwise, create a new clone node with the same value as the input node, and add it to the visited dictionary.
6. Iterate through the neighbors of the input node, and call the `cloneGraph` helper function recursively for each neighbor, adding the returned clones to the clone node's neighbors.
7. Return the clone node.

Finally, call the `cloneGraph` helper function with the given node and the initially empty visited dictionary.
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph. Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors. class Node { public int val; public List neighbors; } **Test case format:** For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list. **An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph. The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph. **Example 1:** **Input:** adjList = \[\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\]\] **Output:** \[\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\]\] **Explanation:** There are 4 nodes in the graph. 1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4). 2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3). 3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4). 4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3). **Example 2:** **Input:** adjList = \[\[\]\] **Output:** \[\[\]\] **Explanation:** Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors. **Example 3:** **Input:** adjList = \[\] **Output:** \[\] **Explanation:** This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes. **Constraints:** * The quantity of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`. * `1 <= Node.val <= 100` * `Node.val` is unique for each node. * There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph. * The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.","python

Medium,"There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `ith` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith` station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return _the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return_ `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**

**Example 1:**

**Input:** gas = \[1,2,3,4,5\], cost = \[3,4,5,1,2\]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** gas = \[2,3,4\], cost = \[3,4,3\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == gas.length == cost.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 105`
*   `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104`","
    ```python
def can_complete_circuit(gas, cost):
    total_gas, total_cost, start, gas_tank = 0, 0, 0, 0
    for i in range(len(gas)):
        total_gas += gas[i]
        total_cost += cost[i]
        gas_tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
        if gas_tank < 0:
            start = i + 1
            gas_tank = 0
    return -1 if total_gas < total_cost else start
```
    
    The algorithm maintains four variables: `total_gas`, `total_cost`, `start`, and `gas_tank`. We initialize these variables to 0. We then loop through each gas station and perform the following steps:

1. Add the gas at the current station to `total_gas`.
2. Add the cost of traveling from this station to the next one to `total_cost`.
3. Add the net gain/loss of gas (gas[i] - cost[i]) to `gas_tank`.
4. If the `gas_tank` is negative, update the `start` position to the next station and reset the `gas_tank` to 0.

After looping through all the gas stations, we check if `total_gas` is greater than or equal to `total_cost`. If it is, we return the `start` position, as this is the first gas station from which we can make a complete trip. If not, we return -1, because it is not possible to complete the circuit. 

This algorithm guarantees a unique solution because if there are multiple valid starting points, there must be a gas station with a lower cost to travel from it to the next station for each solution. As a result, the one with the lowest starting cost would always be chosen, ensuring uniqueness.
