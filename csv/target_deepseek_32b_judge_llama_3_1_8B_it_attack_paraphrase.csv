Easy,"Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,7,11,15\], target = 9
**Output:** \[0,1\]
**Explanation:** Because nums\[0\] + nums\[1\] == 9, we return \[0, 1\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,4\], target = 6
**Output:** \[1,2\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,3\], target = 6
**Output:** \[0,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `-109 <= target <= 109`
*   **Only one valid answer exists.**

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?","
    ```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in map:
            return [map[complement], i]
        map[num] = i
    return []
```
    
    The algorithm leverages a hash map (unordered_map in C++, HashMap in Java, dictionary in Python, and Map in JavaScript). It iterates through the given 'nums' array and calculates the complementary value (target - current value). If the complementary value is already in the hash map, it means that we found a solution, and we return those indices. If the complement is not in the hash map, we store the current element in the hash map with its index. If the algorithm doesn't find the solution, it returns an empty array or throws an exception (in Java).

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n) as well.

Medium,"Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1.  Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
2.  Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
3.  Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
4.  Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `""123 "" -> 123`, `""0032 "" -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
5.  If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.
6.  Return the integer as the final result.

**Note:**

*   Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.
*   **Do not ignore** any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""42 ""
**Output:** 42
**Explanation:** The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1:  ""42 "" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2:  ""42 "" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3:  ""42 "" ( ""42 "" is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is 42.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""   -42 ""
**Output:** -42
**Explanation:**
Step 1:  ""   \-42 "" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2:  ""   \-42 "" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3:  ""   -42 "" ( ""42 "" is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is -42.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  ""4193 with words ""
**Output:** 4193
**Explanation:**
Step 1:  ""4193 with words "" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2:  ""4193 with words "" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3:  ""4193 with words "" ( ""4193 "" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.
Since 4193 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is 4193.

    1. Initialize `result` as 0, index `i` as 0, and `sign` as 1 (positive).
2. Loop through the string until a non-space character is found or the end of the string is reached.
3. If the current character is '+' or '-', update the `sign` according to the character and increment the index `i`.
4. If a digit is found, multiply the previous `result` by 10 and add the digit to it. Increment the index `i`.
5. Check if the result multiplied by the sign is out of the 32-bit signed integer range. If so, return the appropriate boundary value.
6. When no more digits are found, return the final result multiplied by the sign.
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function). The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows: 1. Read in and ignore any leading whitespace. 2. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present. 3. Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored. 4. Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `""123 "" -> 123`, `""0032 "" -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2). 5. If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`. 6. Return the integer as the final result. **Note:** * Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character. * **Do not ignore** any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits. **Example 1:** **Input:** s = ""42 "" **Output:** 42 **Explanation:** The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position. Step 1: ""42 "" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace) ^ Step 2: ""42 "" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+') ^ Step 3: ""42 "" ( ""42 "" is read in) ^ The parsed integer is 42. Since 42 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is 42. **Example 2:** **Input:** s = "" -42 "" **Output:** -42 **Explanation:** Step 1: "" \-42 "" (leading whitespace is read and ignored) ^ Step 2: "" \-42 "" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative) ^ Step 3: "" -42 "" ( ""42 "" is read in) ^ The parsed integer is -42. Since -42 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is -42. **Example 3:** **Input:** s = ""4193 with words "" **Output:** 4193 **Explanation:** Step 1: ""4193 with words "" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace) ^ Step 2: ""4193 with words "" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+') ^ Step 3: ""4193 with words "" ( ""4193 "" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit) ^ The parsed integer is 4193. Since 4193 is in the range \[-231, 231 - 1\], the final result is 4193. **Constraints:** * `0 <= s.length <= 200` * `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (`0-9`), `' '`, `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'.'`.","python

    Here is the algorithm:

1. If the integer is negative, immediately return false, as negative numbers cannot be palindromes.
2. Create a variable named `original` to store the original integer value and `reversed` initialized with 0 to store the reversed integer value.
3. Iterate through the integer while it's greater than zero and, in each iteration, perform the following operations:
   a. Multiply the `reversed` value by 10 and add the modulus of the integer (x) by 10.
   b. Divide the integer (x) by 10, discarding the remainder.
4. Compare `original` and `reversed` integers; if they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

    The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach, with one pointer starting from the left end and the other from the right end. It calculates the area between these two lines and updates the maximum area if the current area is larger than the previously calculated maximum area. If the height at the left pointer is less than the height at the right pointer, it moves the left pointer to the right. Otherwise, it moves the right pointer to the left. The algorithm continues until the pointers meet.

This algorithm ensures that the maximum area is found without having to check all possible pairs of lines because it always chooses the pair of lines with the maximum possible distance and minimum height difference at each step.

    1. Sort the input array `nums`.
2. Loop through `nums` from index `0` to `length - 2`. Let the current index be `i`.
    - If `i` is `0` or `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous element (`nums[i - 1]`), perform the following steps:
        - Initialize two pointers `j` and `k`, where `j` is the next index after `i`, and `k` is the last index of `nums`.
        - While `j` is less than `k`, perform the following steps:
            - Calculate the sum `s` of the elements at indices `i`, `j`, and `k`.
            - If the sum `s` is equal to `0`, then we've found a valid triplet. Add it to the `result` array and move the pointers, `j` and `k`, skipping duplicates if any.
            - If the sum `s` is less than `0`, increment `j` to move towards positive values.
            - If the sum `s` is greater than `0`, decrement `k` to move towards negative values.

If either of these conditions is true, the function returns false. If not, the open bracket is popped from the stack. After iterating through the entire string, the function checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is not empty, the function returns false, indicating there were unmatched open braces. Otherwise, the function returns true, indicating that the string is valid.

3. If `list1` node value is smaller, set `list1.next` to the result of recursively calling the function with `list1.next` and `list2`.

    The algorithm uses a helper function called `generateParenthesisHelper` which receives four parameters: the number of open parentheses left to place, the number of close parentheses left to place, the current string that holds the generated parentheses so far, and the result list to store valid combinations.

The algorithm uses a depth-first search to construct valid combinations of parentheses. It starts with `n` open parentheses and increments the number of close parentheses as it places an open parenthesis. When the helper function has no open or close parentheses left to place, it means a valid combination is found, so it adds the combination to the result list.

The helper function recursively calls itself. If there are open parentheses left to place, it calls itself with one less open parenthesis and one more close parenthesis. If there are close parentheses left to place, it calls itself without changing the number of open parentheses and with one less close parenthesis. Finally, the current string in each case is updated with the placed open or close parenthesis.

    The algorithm follows a divide and conquer approach to merge all linked lists into one sorted linked-list. 

1. If the given array of linked-lists is empty, we return a null pointer.
2. The main function `mergeKLists` merges the first two lists in the array of linked-lists and appends the results (merged list) at the end of the array. It will then remove the merged lists from the beginning of the array. This process is repeated until only one linked-list remains in the array.
3. The function `merge2Lists` is used for merging two sorted linked-lists. The smallest element of the two lists is chosen as the head node and recursively merged with the rest of the lists.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(kN) and a space complexity of O(1), where k is the number of linked-lists, and N is the total number of nodes across all linked-lists.

*   Return `k`.

assert k == expectedNums.length;

Easy,"Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm). The order of the elements may be changed. Then return _the number of elements in_ `nums` _which are not equal to_ `val`.

Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

*   Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
*   Return `k`.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int\[\] nums = \[...\]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int\[\] expectedNums = \[...\]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums\[i\] == expectedNums\[i\];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,2,3\], val = 3
**Output:** 2, nums = \[2,2,\_,\_\]
**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2\], val = 2

Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.

    The algorithm uses two pointers approach. The pointer `i` maintains the position where the next non-val element should be placed, and pointer `j` iterates through the array. If the element at `j` is not equal to `val`, we place it at the position `i` and increment the `i` pointer. The loop continues until we have checked all the elements in the array. The `i` pointer will give us the count of elements that are not equal to `val`, which is the result. Thus, we return the value of `i` as the final result.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, as we only iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) since we do not use any extra memory. We modify the input array in-place.

    1. First, we handle the edge case where dividend = -2^31 and divisor = -1. The result must be 2^31, but since it's out of the signed integer range, we should return 2^31 - 1.
2. Calculate the sign of the result based on the signs of dividend and divisor.
3. We use the bitwise shift operator to handle divisions by powers of 2. In each iteration, we initialize the temp variable as the absolute value of the divisor to calculate how many times it fits into the remaining dividend. We then use another loop to repeatedly double the temp variable (by bitwise left shift) and check if the dividend is still greater or equal. If so, we also double the 'multiple' value associated with temp, as that's the actual quotient in the current iteration.
4. When the shifting loop exits, we subtract the current temp from dividend and accumulate the current multiple to our answer.
5. Once the dividend is less than the divisor, we break the loop and return the signed quotient by multiplying the sign variable to our answer.

Medium,"A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

*   For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.
*   Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.
*   While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

```
    
    We can solve this problem by following the steps below:

1. Identify the largest index `k` such that `nums[k] < nums[k + 1]`. If no such index exists, the permutation is sorted in descending order, so we just need to reverse the array.
2. Identify the largest index `l` greater than `k` such that `nums[k] < nums[l]`.
3. Swap the value of `nums[k]` with that of `nums[l]`.
4. Reverse the sub-array `nums[k + 1:]` which is guaranteed to be in non-increasing order.

By making these changes in place and only using constant extra memory, we obtain the next permutation of the array nums.
    ","Considering the aforementioned details, A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order. * For example, for `arr = [1,2,3]`, the following are all the permutations of `arr`: `[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]`. The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order). * For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`. * Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`. * While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement. Given an array of integers `nums`, _find the next permutation of_ `nums`. The replacement must be **[in place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** and use only constant extra memory. **Example 1:** **Input:** nums = \[1,2,3\] **Output:** \[1,3,2\] **Example 2:** **Input:** nums = \[3,2,1\] **Output:** \[1,2,3\] **Example 3:** **Input:** nums = \[1,1,5\] **Output:** \[1,5,1\] **Constraints:** * `1 <= nums.length <= 100` * `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`","python

    The algorithm is a variation of binary search. The main idea is to decide whether the target is in the left or the right half of the current subarray. If nums[mid] >= nums[left], the left half is sorted. If target is in the range [nums[left], nums[mid]), set right = mid - 1. Otherwise, set left = mid + 1. If nums[mid] < nums[left], the right half must be sorted. If target is in the range (nums[mid], nums[right]], set left = mid + 1. Otherwise, set right = mid - 1. Continue the process until the target is found or the subarray is empty, in which case return -1. This algorithm has a runtime complexity of O(log n) because it eliminates half of the remaining elements at each step, similar to a binary search.

    The given problem requires a binary search algorithm. We define two pointers, `left` and `right`, initially set to the first and last index of the array. We then enter a loop that continues as long as left is less than or equal to right. Inside the loop, we calculate the middle index, `mid`, as the average of left and right. If the value at this middle index is equal to the target value, we return the middle index. If the middle value is less than the target value, we set left to `mid + 1`, meaning we search the right half of the remaining array. If the middle value is greater than the target value, we set the right to `mid - 1`, meaning we search the left half of the remaining array. After the loop, if the target value is not found, we return the value of the left pointer, which represents the index where the target value should be inserted.

    1. The algorithm starts by searching for an empty cell (denoted by '.').
2. Once an empty cell is found, it tries to insert a number from 1 to 9.
3. For each inserted number, it checks if its placement is valid based on Sudoku rules:
   - The number must not be present in the same row or column.
   - The number must not be present in its corresponding 3x3 grid.
4. It calls itself (backtracks) recursively whenever a valid number is inserted into the cell.
5. If inserting a number fails to lead to a valid solution, the algorithm reverts that cell to '.' and tries the next number.

    The algorithm is a recursive backtracking algorithm. We define a helper function `findCombinations` that takes the following parameters:

1. `startIndex`: the index of the candidates array from which it can start choosing numbers.
2. `remaining`: the remaining sum needed to reach the target.

The base cases are:
- If `remaining` is 0, it means we have found a valid combination, so we return a list containing an empty list.
- If `startIndex` is equal to the length of candidates, or `remaining` is negative, there are no valid combinations, so we return an empty list.

In the function, we first initialize an empty list called `result`. Then, we make two recursive calls to `findCombinations`:

1. Excluding the current candidate at `startIndex` and incrementing `startIndex`, to search for combinations without this candidate.
2. Including the current candidate in the combination, and decreasing `remaining` accordingly (without updating `startIndex`).

After getting results from both recursive calls, we merge them and return the final list of combinations.

The main function `combinationSum` calls `findCombinations` with `startIndex` as 0 and `remaining` as the target, and returns the result after the recursion is done.

    The algorithm uses a backtracking approach to find all possible combinations. It starts by sorting the input `candidates` array/list. Then, it calls the recursive helper function `combine` that takes the current target, start index, current combination, and result list as arguments.

1. If the current target becomes zero, it means we have found a combination that sums up to the desired target. Add the current combination to the result list and return.
2. Iterate through the `candidates` list starting from the given index.
   - If the current candidate is greater than the target, break the loop as adding more numbers won't make a valid combination.
   - Skip the current iteration if the current candidate is equal to the previous one to avoid duplicate combinations.
   - Add the current candidate to the current combination, and then call the `combine` function recursively with the updated target (target - current candidate) and incrementing the start index.
   - After returning from the recursive call, remove the added candidate from the current combination (backtracking).

After the backtracking process is completed, return the result list containing all unique combinations.

    return water
```
    
    The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach, initializing left and right pointers to the beginning and end of the elevation map, respectively. It also initializes two variables `maxLeft` and `maxRight` to keep track of the maximum heights on the left and right of the pointers, as well as a variable `water` to store the trapped water.

The algorithm iterates through the elevation map until the left pointer is less than the right pointer. In each iteration, it compares the values at both pointers to determine which side is shorter. If the value at the left pointer is less than or equal to the value at the right pointer, it means water can be trapped on the left side up to the height of the shorter bar. The algorithm updates `maxLeft` with the maximum height on the left side and then adds the trapped water (which is the difference between the maximum height and the current height) to the `water` variable. The left pointer is then incremented. If the value at the right pointer is smaller, the same logic is applied to the right side and the right pointer is decremented.

This process is repeated until the left pointer is no longer less than the right pointer, at which point the total trapped water has been calculated and the `water` variable is returned. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) as it only uses constant extra space.

1. The base case is when the index reaches the last element of the array; at this point, we append the current configuration to the ""results"" list.
2. For each index, we iterate from `index` to the end of the array, performing the following steps:
    a. Swap `index` and `i` elements.
    b. Recursively call the helper function with `index + 1`.
    c. Swap the elements back to their original positions.

This will generate all possible permutations, as it swaps elements in different positions while maintaining the original order in the input array. The termination condition for the recursion is the base case when we reach the end of the array. The complexity of this algorithm is O(N!), as there are N! permutations of an array of N elements.

    We use backtracking to generate permutations. Firstly, we sort the `nums` array to make sure that duplicate numbers are located together. Then, for each recursive backtracking call, we swap the elements in the range `[start, len(nums) - 1]` with `nums[start]`, ignoring already-visited elements by using a `visited` array.

We also skip any element that is equal to the current `start` element to avoid duplicates. After generating a valid permutation by iterating through all indices, we append the current permutation to the result array. When backtracking, we maintain the original order of elements before moving to the next level.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n! * n) since there are n! available permutations and each permutation requires O(n) time to build the solution. The space complexity is O(n) to store the `visited` array and temporary lists.

    The algorithm iterates through the input array of strings. For each string, create a sorted version of the string as key, and store the original strings as values. Use a data structure like a map or dictionary to store the grouped anagrams in these key-value pairs. The keys will represent the different anagrams, while the values will be lists of the original strings that fit the anagram. Finally, extract the values (lists of anagrams) from the map or dictionary and return them. This works because anagrams will produce the same sorted strings as keys.

    The algorithm uses the binary exponentiation technique, which is a faster method of calculating x^n compared to the naive approach. It relies on the process of repeatedly multiplying the current product by itself and updating it after each iteration. The loop iterates through the bits of the exponent n, from the least significant to the most significant. If the current bit of n is 1, the result is multiplied by the current product. At the end of the loop, the current product is updated by squaring it. This process continues until all bits of the exponent have been processed.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log(n)) because the loop iterates through the bits of n, and the number of bits in n is proportional to the logarithm of n. The space complexity is O(1), as the space used by the temporary variables does not depend on the size of n.

    The algorithm uses the backtracking approach to solve the N-Queens puzzle. The idea is to place queens one by one in different columns, starting from the leftmost column. When placing a queen, check if that position is safe from all previously placed queens in terms of the horizontal, diagonal, and anti-diagonal directions. If the selected position is safe, move on to the next column and try to place another queen there. If no safe positions are found in the current column, then go back to the previous column and move the queen to another safe position. Repeat this process until all queens are placed in a valid configuration or all possible arrangements have been tried. During the process, whenever we successfully place `n` queens on the board, add that configuration to our result list. Finally, return the list of all unique solutions found.

    The algorithm recursively places queens on columns and checks if the placement is safe, i.e., no queens are attacking each other. 
1. Maintain an array `cols` storing the row indices of placed queens. The index in this array represents the column the queen is placed in. This ensures that no two queens are placed in the same column.
2. Recursively place queens (column-wise).
3. Check for a safe position for each queen in the current column:
   a. Check for same row (`cols[i] == row`).
   b. Check for diagonal attack (`abs(i - col) == abs(cols[i] - row)`).
4. If the current position is safe, place the queen in the current column at the current row position, and continue to place the next queen.
5. If all queens are placed, increment the solution count.
6. If the recursive call finishes, backtrack by removing the queen from the current column and move on to the next row in the same column.
7. The base case is when the `cols` size equals `n`, meaning all queens have been placed safely; increment the count.

    The algorithm first sorts the intervals based on their start time. Then, it initializes an empty list `result` to store the merged intervals, and adds the first interval to `result`. Next, it iterates through the remaining intervals, comparing the end time of the last interval in `result` to the start time of the current interval. If they overlap (i.e., the end time of the last interval in `result` is greater than or equal to the start time of the current interval), then the end time of the last interval in `result` is updated to the maximum of its own end time and the end time of the current interval. Otherwise, the current interval is added to `result`. The process continues until all intervals have been processed, and `result` contains the merged, non-overlapping intervals covering the input intervals.

    The algorithm to merge the new interval starts by exploring the non-overlapping intervals before the new one as we are given a sorted list of intervals. We add the explored intervals that came before to the result. After that, we continue exploring intervals that overlap with the new interval and continuously merging them. We update the new interval's starting and ending points according to the merging process until no overlapping intervals remain.

Hard,"Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

*   A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
*   Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than `0` and not exceed `maxWidth`.
*   The input array `words` contains at least one word.

4. Find the number of gaps in the current line. If it is the last line or there is only one word, left-justify the words and pad the remaining space with spaces.
5. If it's not the last line, distribute spaces as evenly as possible between words: calculate `evenSpaces` and `extraSpaces`, and add an extra space to the left gaps until there are no more `extraSpaces`.

    The algorithm uses a binary search approach to find the integer square root of the given number `x`. It starts with the smallest possible answer (1) and the largest possible answer (x), updating the ""start"" and ""end"" positions based on whether the current midpoint squared is smaller or larger than x.

Firstly, the number of rows and columns (m and n) are computed. Then, we initialize the left and right pointers (l and r).

In each step of the binary search, we calculate the middle index (mid) and get the corresponding value (mid_val) in the matrix. To get the value in the matrix, we divide mid by n and take the remainder.

We then compare the mid_val with the target. If it is equal to the target, we return true. If it's less than the target, we move the left pointer to the next position (mid + 1). Otherwise, we move the right pointer (mid - 1).

Likewise, `blue` is responsible for tracking the position where the next 2 should be swapped to, starting from the end of the array. `white` is responsible for iterating through the array.

While `white` is less than or equal to `blue`, check the current `nums[white]` value. If it is 0, swap it with the value at index `red`, and increment both `red` and `white`. If it is 1, simply increment `white`. If it is 2, swap the value at index `white` with the value at index `blue`, and decrement `blue` without incrementing `white` since the newly swapped value at index `white` might be 0 or 2.

    - If valid, update the answer substring's `start` and `length` if the current window's length is less than the current minimum.
    - Then, increment the `left` pointer to slide the window until the current character count in the window goes below the count in `need`. Update the `valid` counter accordingly.

    The algorithm uses a dummy node to simplify the handling of the head node of the linked list. We declare two pointers: `prev` and `curr` which are pointers to the previous and current nodes, respectively. 

The algorithm iterates through the list with the current pointer. If the current node's value is equal to the next node's value, we continue moving the current pointer along the duplicate values. Once we reach the end of duplicates, we check if the previous node's next pointer is pointing to the current node. If it is, it means there were no duplicates (prev and curr are consecutive), so we move the `prev` pointer to the current node. Otherwise, we set `prev.next` to `curr.next` to skip the duplicates. 

Finally, we move the current pointer to the next node, and repeat the process. The resulting list will have all duplicates removed, and the changes will persist as the dummy node is used to reference the head of the modified list.

    The algorithm to delete all duplicates in a sorted linked list simply iterates through the list and compares the value of the current node with the value of the next. If both values are the same, it means that there is a duplicate, so the current node's ""next"" pointer is updated to point to the node after the duplicate. If the values are different, the algorithm continues iterating to the next node. The process continues until reaching the end of the list.

    The algorithm utilizes a stack to keep track of the indices of the heights array. It starts iterating through the array, appending a zero at the end to ensure the last bar is considered. When a higher bar is found, it is pushed onto the stack, and if a lower bar is found, it calculates the area of the bar under the current top of the stack considering the width between the current bar and the next lowest bar in the stack, storing the highest area found.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) as it iterates through the heights only once, resulting in optimal performance.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array_ `nums1`.

Iterate in a while loop until i and j are both less than 0. Compare the values of nums1[i] and nums2[j]. If nums1[i] is greater, assign nums1[i] at position k in nums1, decrement i and k. Otherwise, assign nums2[j] at position k in nums1, and decrement j and k. This process continues for all elements in nums2.

After the loop, if there are still elements remaining in nums2 (j >= 0), copy the remaining elements of nums2 to nums1. In this way, we merge nums1 and nums2 in non-decreasing order.

The algorithm uses a backtracking approach. It starts with an empty subset and iteratively adds elements from the input array to the subset. It keeps track of the starting index to avoid creating duplicate subsets.

In the C++ and Java implementations, a `set` data structure is used to store unique subsets. In the Python implementation, Python's `set` is used along with itertools' `combinations` function to achieve the same result. In the JavaScript implementation, a `Set` object is used, but as it doesn't handle array comparisons properly, each subset is converted into a JSON string to compare the string representation of subsets.

For each character in the string `s`, consider its corresponding one-digit and two-digits representations. If the one-digit representation is valid (>=1), we can increment `dp[i]` by `dp[i-1]`, which means one more way to decode the string by using the one-digit representation of the current character.

The algorithm iterates through the string s, starting at the current index. It keeps track of the current number (0-255) being constructed by multiplying the current number by 10 and adding the current digit. If the current number is greater than 255, we break the iteration.

We then call the dfs function recursively, with the current index incremented by one, the current IP appended with the current character and a dot, and incrementing part by 1. If the current number is 0 (which indicates a leading zero), we also break the iteration.

    The algorithm follows a simple recursive approach to determine if a given binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST). The key idea is to maintain a range for each node, which is defined by the minimum and maximum values that the node's value should be within. For example, the root node's value should be in the range of (-Infinity, Infinity). When traversing to the left child, the maximum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value, and for traversing to the right child, the minimum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value. The algorithm continues recursively in this manner.

A helper function, `isValidBSTHelper`, is defined and initialized with the root and the range (-Infinity, Infinity). If the node is `null`, it means that we have reached a leaf node and it should return `true`. If the value of the node is not within the specified range, it means that the node does not meet the BST requirement and the helper function should return `false`. If the node is valid, then the helper function proceeds to check for valid BSTs in its left and right subtrees with the updated range.

The function then checks whether the values of both nodes are equal and continues to call itself recursively, but with the arguments changed to evaluate the left subtree and right subtree symmetrically. If the left and right subtrees have symmetric nodes, the function will return true; otherwise, it will return false.

The recursive calls in the helper function flip the direction of traversal for both subtrees to ensure that the subtrees are compared symmetrically. In each recursive call, the appropriate child nodes are visited in opposite directions to make sure they can be properly compared.

2. If the root is empty, return the empty result list.
3. Create a queue, and enqueue the root element.
4. Enter a loop while the queue is not empty.
   - Initialize an empty level list.
   - Get the number of elements at the current level by using the queue's size.
   - For each element at the current level, do the following:
     -- Dequeue the element, and add its value to the level list.
     -- Enqueue the left child of the dequeued element (if it exists).
     -- Enqueue the right child of the dequeued element (if it exists).

    The algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) on both the preorder and inorder traversal results. This algorithm iteratively breaks the inorder sequence into left and right subtrees using the preorder array. The basic idea is that the first element of preorder traversal will always be the root of the tree. Then, we can find that root node's index in the inorder traversal, and create the left subtree from the elements to the left of the index, and the right subtree from the elements to the right of the index. Then we continue this process recursively.

To improve the performance of the search for the index, we can use a map (in C++, Java and JavaScript) or a dictionary (in Python) to store the indices of all elements in the inorder traversal. This way, we don't need to traverse the inorder array every time to find the index of the current element.

Since we're doing this for Python, Java, C++ and JavaScript, some data structures might look a bit different and have different functions to do the same action, but the algorithm used in all languages is the same.

- Preorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- Inorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- A map is used to store the indices for inorder traversal in C++, Java, and JavaScript, while a dictionary is used in Python.
- A helper function is used to recursively construct the tree.
- For Python and JavaScript, the scope of pre_idx is made non-local, so it does not require additional arguments.

The resulting functions return the root node of the reconstructed binary tree.

    The algorithm recursively constructs a height-balanced binary search tree from the given sorted linked list. At each recursive step, the algorithm performs the following steps:
1. Initialize slow and fast pointers at the head of the current sub-list.
2. Move the fast pointer twice as fast as the slow pointer to find the middle element of the sub-list.
3. Detach the left sub-list from the middle element.
4. Create a new tree node with the value of the middle element as root.
5. Recursively convert the left and right sub-lists into tree nodes attached as left and right children of the root.

    The algorithm is based on the depth-first search. In this algorithm, we define a helper function named `getHeight` which will return the height of the given subtree if it is balanced, otherwise, it will return -1.

The `getHeight` function works as follows:
1. If the current node is null, return 0 (base case).
2. Call the function recursively for the left subtree (leftHeight) and the right subtree (rightHeight).
3. If either of the subtrees is not balanced or the height difference is greater than 1, return -1.
4. Otherwise, return the maximum height of the left and right subtrees incremented by 1.

The main function `isBalanced` just calls the `getHeight` function and checks whether its result is -1 or not. If it is not -1, the binary tree is height-balanced, otherwise, it is not balanced.

```
    
    We perform a depth-first search on the tree. The base case would be an empty tree with a depth of 0.

For each non-null subtree, we recursively find the minimum depth of the left and right children. Then, we have three cases:
1. If both left and right children are null, then the current node is a leaf node, and the minimum depth is 1.
2. If either left or right child is null, we return the depth of the other child + 1.
3. If both children are non-null, we take the minimum depth of both children and add 1.

To handle all the cases in a single line, we use a ternary conditional expression in C++, Java, and JavaScript, and use the `and`-`or` short-circuit syntax in Python. We check if either left or right is 0, and in that case return left + right + 1 which handles cases 1 and 2; otherwise, we return the minimum depth of both children + 1, which handles case 3.

Then for non-leaf nodes, it checks if there exists a root-to-leaf path in the left or right subtree by recursively calling the function on the child nodes. The targetSum is updated by subtracting the value of the current node i.e., `targetSum - root.val`.
