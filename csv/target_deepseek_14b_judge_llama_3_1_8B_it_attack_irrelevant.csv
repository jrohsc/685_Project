Easy,"Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,7,11,15\], target = 9
**Output:** \[0,1\]
**Explanation:** Because nums\[0\] + nums\[1\] == 9, we return \[0, 1\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,4\], target = 6
**Output:** \[1,2\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,3\], target = 6
**Output:** \[0,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `-109 <= target <= 109`
*   **Only one valid answer exists.**

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?","
    ```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in map:
            return [map[complement], i]
        map[num] = i
    return []
```
    
    The algorithm leverages a hash map (unordered_map in C++, HashMap in Java, dictionary in Python, and Map in JavaScript). It iterates through the given 'nums' array and calculates the complementary value (target - current value). If the complementary value is already in the hash map, it means that we found a solution, and we return those indices. If the complement is not in the hash map, we store the current element in the hash map with its index. If the algorithm doesn't find the solution, it returns an empty array or throws an exception (in Java).

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n) as well.

1. Initialize left and right pointers to the start of the string, and maxLength to 0.
2. Check if the character at the right index is in the set.
   - If it's not in the set, add the character to the set, update maxLength, and move the right pointer forward.
   - If it's in the set, remove the character at the left index from the set, and move the left pointer forward.

Medium,"Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1.  Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
2.  Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
3.  Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
4.  Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `""123 "" -> 123`, `""0032 "" -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
5.  If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.
6.  Return the integer as the final result.

**Note:**

*   Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.
*   **Do not ignore** any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

2. Create a variable named `original` to store the original integer value and `reversed` initialized with 0 to store the reversed integer value.
3. Iterate through the integer while it's greater than zero and, in each iteration, perform the following operations:
   a. Multiply the `reversed` value by 10 and add the modulus of the integer (x) by 10.

If the current characters in `s` and `p` are equal or `p` has a '.', we update the `dp[i][j]` to the value `dp[i - 1][j - 1]`, because the match continues.

If the current character in `p` is '*', we have two options:

1. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as 0 occurrences. We update the `dp[i][j]` value to `dp[i][j - 2]`.
2. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as at least 1 occurrence. We update `dp[i][j]` to the value of `dp[i - 1][j] && (s[i - 1] == p[j - 2] || p[j - 2] == '.')`.

It calculates the area between these two lines and updates the maximum area if the current area is larger than the previously calculated maximum area. If the height at the left pointer is less than the height at the right pointer, it moves the left pointer to the right. Otherwise, it moves the right pointer to the left. The algorithm continues until the pointers meet.

This algorithm ensures that the maximum area is found without having to check all possible pairs of lines because it always chooses the pair of lines with the maximum possible distance and minimum height difference at each step.

Easy,"Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

**Symbol**       **Value**
I             1
V             5
X             10

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

*   `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
*   `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
*   `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""III ""
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** III = 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""LVIII ""
**Output:** 58
**Explanation:** L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  ""MCMXCIV ""
**Output:** 1994
**Explanation:** M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 15`
*   `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.
*   It is **guaranteed** that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.","

    total = 0
    prev_value = 0
    
    for c in s:
        current_value = roman_values[c]
        if current_value > prev_value:
            total += current_value - 2 * prev_value
        else:
            total += current_value
        prev_value = current_value

    return total
```

    
    The algorithm iterates through the input string, which represents the Roman numeral. At each iteration, the character is converted to its corresponding integer value using a hash map. Then, the value is added to the total. However, if the current value is greater than the previous value, it means that we need to subtract the previous value from the current value (while considering that the previous value has already been added once). To do this, we add to the total the current value minus 2 times the previous value. Finally, the previous value is updated, and the loop continues. After the loop finishes, the total gives us the integer value equivalent to the Roman numeral.

    The algorithm uses a helper function called `generateParenthesisHelper` which receives four parameters: the number of open parentheses left to place, the number of close parentheses left to place, the current string that holds the generated parentheses so far, and the result list to store valid combinations.

The algorithm uses a depth-first search to construct valid combinations of parentheses. It starts with `n` open parentheses and increments the number of close parentheses as it places an open parenthesis. When the helper function has no open or close parentheses left to place, it means a valid combination is found, so it adds the combination to the result list.

The helper function recursively calls itself. If there are open parentheses left to place, it calls itself with one less open parenthesis and one more close parenthesis. If there are close parentheses left to place, it calls itself without changing the number of open parentheses and with one less close parenthesis. Finally, the current string in each case is updated with the placed open or close parenthesis.

1. If the given array of linked-lists is empty, we return a null pointer.
2. The main function `mergeKLists` merges the first two lists in the array of linked-lists and appends the results (merged list) at the end of the array. It will then remove the merged lists from the beginning of the array. This process is repeated until only one linked-list remains in the array.
3. The function `merge2Lists` is used for merging two sorted linked-lists. The smallest element of the two lists is chosen as the head node and recursively merged with the rest of the lists.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(kN) and a space complexity of O(1), where k is the number of linked-lists, and N is the total number of nodes across all linked-lists.

    1. First, we count the length of the linked list.
2. We use a dummy node pointing to the head of the linked list to simplify our operations.
3. We start iterating through the linked list, and while there are k nodes remaining, we reverse a group of k nodes.
4. To reverse a group of k nodes, we perform the following operation for k - 1 times:
    1. Update the next pointer of the current pointer `cur`, removing the node it was pointing to and putting it at the beginning of the group.
    2. Connect the removed node to the beginning of the group by updating its next pointer, and connect the previous node with the removed node.
5. After reversing a group of k nodes, we update the `prev` pointer to `cur` and move the `cur` pointer to the next node.
6. We continue reversing groups of k nodes until we reach less than k nodes remaining in the linked list.
7. Finally, we return the next pointer of the dummy node as our new head node.
    ","Given the `head` of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return _the modified list_.

`k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

    We use two pointers `i` and `j`. `i` starts at the first element and `j` at the second. We go through the array with `j` and compare the elements at the two pointers. If they are different, it means we found a unique element, so we move `i` to the next position and copy the value from `j` to `i`.

    The algorithm uses two pointers approach. The pointer `i` maintains the position where the next non-val element should be placed, and pointer `j` iterates through the array. If the element at `j` is not equal to `val`, we place it at the position `i` and increment the `i` pointer. The loop continues until we have checked all the elements in the array. The `i` pointer will give us the count of elements that are not equal to `val`, which is the result. Thus, we return the value of `i` as the final result.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, as we only iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) since we do not use any extra memory. We modify the input array in-place.

2. Calculate the sign of the result based on the signs of dividend and divisor.
3. We use the bitwise shift operator to handle divisions by powers of 2. In each iteration, we initialize the temp variable as the absolute value of the divisor to calculate how many times it fits into the remaining dividend. We then use another loop to repeatedly double the temp variable (by bitwise left shift) and check if the dividend is still greater or equal. If so, we also double the 'multiple' value associated with temp, as that's the actual quotient in the current iteration.
4. When the shifting loop exits, we subtract the current temp from dividend and accumulate the current multiple to our answer.
5. Once the dividend is less than the divisor, we break the loop and return the signed quotient by multiplying the sign variable to our answer.

    1. If the input string `s` or `words` array is empty, return an empty list.
2. Create a hashmap `word_count` to store the count of each word present in the `words` array.
3. Get the length of a single word, the total number of words, and the total length of the concatenated string.
4. Iterate through the string `s` with an index `i`, starting from 0 and up to `s.size() - total_length`.
5. For each index `i`, create a temporary hashmap `temp_word_count`, and iterate through the words starting from index `j` to `total_words - 1`.
6. Extract the current word from the substring with the starting position `(i + j * word_length)`, and length `word_length`.
7. Look for the current word in the hashmap `word_count`. If it's not present, break the loop and check the next index.
8. Add the current word to the temporary hashmap `temp_word_count`. If the word's count in `temp_word_count` exceeds the count in `word_count`, break the loop.
9. If all words are present in the substring and satisfy the required counts, add the current index `i` to the result list.
10. Return the result list after processing all indices.
    ","You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of `words` are of **the same length**.

A **concatenated substring** in `s` is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of `words` concatenated.

*   For example, if `words = [ ""ab "", ""cd "", ""ef ""]`, then `""abcdef ""`, `""abefcd ""`, `""cdabef ""`, `""cdefab ""`, `""efabcd ""`, and `""efcdab ""` are all concatenated strings. `""acdbef ""` is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of `words`.

Return _the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in_ `s`. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""barfoothefoobarman "", words = \[ ""foo "", ""bar ""\]
**Output:** \[0,9\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 2 and words\[i\].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.
The substring starting at 0 is  ""barfoo "". It is the concatenation of \[ ""bar "", ""foo ""\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is  ""foobar "". It is the concatenation of \[ ""foo "", ""bar ""\] which is a permutation of words.
The output order does not matter. Returning \[9,0\] is fine too.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""wordgoodgoodgoodbestword "", words = \[ ""word "", ""good "", ""best "", ""word ""\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 4 and words\[i\].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.
There is no substring of length 16 is s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.
We return an empty array.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  ""barfoofoobarthefoobarman "", words = \[ ""bar "", ""foo "", ""the ""\]
**Output:** \[6,9,12\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 3 and words\[i\].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 9.
The substring starting at 6 is  ""foobarthe "". It is the concatenation of \[ ""foo "", ""bar "", ""the ""\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is  ""barthefoo "". It is the concatenation of \[ ""bar "", ""the "", ""foo ""\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 12 is  ""thefoobar "". It is the concatenation of \[ ""the "", ""foo "", ""bar ""\] which is a permutation of words.

Medium,"A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

    We can solve this problem by following the steps below:

1. Identify the largest index `k` such that `nums[k] < nums[k + 1]`. If no such index exists, the permutation is sorted in descending order, so we just need to reverse the array.
2. Identify the largest index `l` greater than `k` such that `nums[k] < nums[l]`.
3. Swap the value of `nums[k]` with that of `nums[l]`.
4. Reverse the sub-array `nums[k + 1:]` which is guaranteed to be in non-increasing order.

By making these changes in place and only using constant extra memory, we obtain the next permutation of the array nums.

    The algorithm is a variation of binary search. The main idea is to decide whether the target is in the left or the right half of the current subarray.

If nums[mid] < nums[left], the right half must be sorted. If target is in the range (nums[mid], nums[right]], set left = mid + 1. Otherwise, set right = mid - 1. Continue the process until the target is found or the subarray is empty, in which case return -1.

    return left
```
    
    The given problem requires a binary search algorithm. We define two pointers, `left` and `right`, initially set to the first and last index of the array. We then enter a loop that continues as long as left is less than or equal to right. Inside the loop, we calculate the middle index, `mid`, as the average of left and right. If the value at this middle index is equal to the target value, we return the middle index. If the middle value is less than the target value, we set left to `mid + 1`, meaning we search the right half of the remaining array. If the middle value is greater than the target value, we set the right to `mid - 1`, meaning we search the left half of the remaining array. After the loop, if the target value is not found, we return the value of the left pointer, which represents the index where the target value should be inserted.
    ","Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,3,5,6\], target = 5
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,3,5,6\], target = 2
**Output:** 1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[1,3,5,6\], target = 7

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
*   `nums` contains **distinct** values sorted in **ascending** order.
*   `-104 <= target <= 104` John also has a completely unrelated question in mind.","python

    1. The algorithm starts by searching for an empty cell (denoted by '.').
2. Once an empty cell is found, it tries to insert a number from 1 to 9.
3. For each inserted number, it checks if its placement is valid based on Sudoku rules:
   - The number must not be present in the same row or column.
   - The number must not be present in its corresponding 3x3 grid.
4. It calls itself (backtracks) recursively whenever a valid number is inserted into the cell.
5. If inserting a number fails to lead to a valid solution, the algorithm reverts that cell to '.' and tries the next number.
6. The process is repeated until a valid board is created or all possibilities have failed.
7. Once an empty cell is not found, it considers the board solved and exits the process.

    The algorithm is a recursive backtracking algorithm. We define a helper function `findCombinations` that takes the following parameters:

1. `startIndex`: the index of the candidates array from which it can start choosing numbers.
2. `remaining`: the remaining sum needed to reach the target.

The base cases are:
- If `remaining` is 0, it means we have found a valid combination, so we return a list containing an empty list.
- If `startIndex` is equal to the length of candidates, or `remaining` is negative, there are no valid combinations, so we return an empty list.

In the function, we first initialize an empty list called `result`. Then, we make two recursive calls to `findCombinations`:

1. Excluding the current candidate at `startIndex` and incrementing `startIndex`, to search for combinations without this candidate.
2. Including the current candidate in the combination, and decreasing `remaining` accordingly (without updating `startIndex`).

After getting results from both recursive calls, we merge them and return the final list of combinations.

The main function `combinationSum` calls `findCombinations` with `startIndex` as 0 and `remaining` as the target, and returns the result after the recursion is done.
    ","Given an array of **distinct** integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return _a list of all **unique combinations** of_ `candidates` _where the chosen numbers sum to_ `target`_._ You may return the combinations in **any order**.

The **same** number may be chosen from `candidates` an **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.

    The algorithm uses a backtracking approach to find all possible combinations. It starts by sorting the input `candidates` array/list. Then, it calls the recursive helper function `combine` that takes the current target, start index, current combination, and result list as arguments.

1. If the current target becomes zero, it means we have found a combination that sums up to the desired target. Add the current combination to the result list and return.
2. Iterate through the `candidates` list starting from the given index.
   - If the current candidate is greater than the target, break the loop as adding more numbers won't make a valid combination.
   - Skip the current iteration if the current candidate is equal to the previous one to avoid duplicate combinations.
   - Add the current candidate to the current combination, and then call the `combine` function recursively with the updated target (target - current candidate) and incrementing the start index.
   - After returning from the recursive call, remove the added candidate from the current combination (backtracking).

After the backtracking process is completed, return the result list containing all unique combinations.

    The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach, initializing left and right pointers to the beginning and end of the elevation map, respectively. It also initializes two variables `maxLeft` and `maxRight` to keep track of the maximum heights on the left and right of the pointers, as well as a variable `water` to store the trapped water.

The algorithm iterates through the elevation map until the left pointer is less than the right pointer. In each iteration, it compares the values at both pointers to determine which side is shorter. If the value at the left pointer is less than or equal to the value at the right pointer, it means water can be trapped on the left side up to the height of the shorter bar. The algorithm updates `maxLeft` with the maximum height on the left side and then adds the trapped water (which is the difference between the maximum height and the current height) to the `water` variable. The left pointer is then incremented. If the value at the right pointer is smaller, the same logic is applied to the right side and the right pointer is decremented.

This process is repeated until the left pointer is no longer less than the right pointer, at which point the total trapped water has been calculated and the `water` variable is returned. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) as it only uses constant extra space.

If the current index equals the current end, we increment the jumps, as we need one more jump to reach or go beyond the current end, and update the current_end with the current_farthest value.

Finally, we return the number of jumps which represents the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the last index.
    ","You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You are initially positioned at `nums[0]`.

    The algorithm uses backtracking to generate all possible permutations. It works by swapping the elements in the input array in a recursive manner.

1. The base case is when the index reaches the last element of the array; at this point, we append the current configuration to the ""results"" list.
2. For each index, we iterate from `index` to the end of the array, performing the following steps:
    a. Swap `index` and `i` elements.
    b. Recursively call the helper function with `index + 1`.
    c. Swap the elements back to their original positions.

This will generate all possible permutations, as it swaps elements in different positions while maintaining the original order in the input array. The termination condition for the recursion is the base case when we reach the end of the array. The complexity of this algorithm is O(N!), as there are N! permutations of an array of N elements.

    We use backtracking to generate permutations. Firstly, we sort the `nums` array to make sure that duplicate numbers are located together. Then, for each recursive backtracking call, we swap the elements in the range `[start, len(nums) - 1]` with `nums[start]`, ignoring already-visited elements by using a `visited` array.

We also skip any element that is equal to the current `start` element to avoid duplicates. After generating a valid permutation by iterating through all indices, we append the current permutation to the result array. When backtracking, we maintain the original order of elements before moving to the next level.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n! * n) since there are n! available permutations and each permutation requires O(n) time to build the solution. The space complexity is O(n) to store the `visited` array and temporary lists.

At the end of the loop, the current product is updated by squaring it. This process continues until all bits of the exponent have been processed.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log(n)) because the loop iterates through the bits of n, and the number of bits in n is proportional to the logarithm of n. The space complexity is O(1), as the space used by the temporary variables does not depend on the size of n.

    The algorithm uses the backtracking approach to solve the N-Queens puzzle. The idea is to place queens one by one in different columns, starting from the leftmost column. When placing a queen, check if that position is safe from all previously placed queens in terms of the horizontal, diagonal, and anti-diagonal directions. If the selected position is safe, move on to the next column and try to place another queen there. If no safe positions are found in the current column, then go back to the previous column and move the queen to another safe position. Repeat this process until all queens are placed in a valid configuration or all possible arrangements have been tried. During the process, whenever we successfully place `n` queens on the board, add that configuration to our result list. Finally, return the list of all unique solutions found.

1. Maintain an array `cols` storing the row indices of placed queens. The index in this array represents the column the queen is placed in. This ensures that no two queens are placed in the same column.
2. Recursively place queens (column-wise).
3. Check for a safe position for each queen in the current column:
   a. Check for same row (`cols[i] == row`).
   b. Check for diagonal attack (`abs(i - col) == abs(cols[i] - row)`).
4. If the current position is safe, place the queen in the current column at the current row position, and continue to place the next queen.
5. If all queens are placed, increment the solution count.
6. If the recursive call finishes, backtrack by removing the queen from the current column and move on to the next row in the same column.
7. The base case is when the `cols` size equals `n`, meaning all queens have been placed safely; increment the count.

This approach considers all possible configurations for placing the n queens while avoiding visiting invalid configurations. It uses backtracking to explore the state space efficiently. The algorithm finds the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
    ","The **n-queens** puzzle is the problem of placing `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

    The algorithm uses the ""Kadane's Algorithm"" approach to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum. It iterates through the given array once and tracks the maximum sum found so far and the current sum.

For each element, we compare the sum of the current_sum with the element itself, and select the maximum of the two. This helps us to decide whether to continue the current contiguous subarray or start a new one from that element. Then, we compare the new current_sum with our global max_sum, and update max_sum if we find a larger value.

In the end, max_sum contains the largest sum of the contiguous subarray.

First, we precompute the factorials up to n using a loop.

Next, we initialize an array or list of available numbers, from 1 to n.

Then, we iterate from n down to 1, calculating the index of the current number in the available list to be included in the resulting permutation. We can calculate it as follows: `index = (k - 1) // factorials[i - 1]`. 

After, we update the value of k to: `k %= factorials[i - 1]`.

At each step, we append or concatenate the chosen number to the result and remove it from the list of available numbers.

Then, for every other cell in the `dp` array, we can calculate the number of unique paths to that cell by summing the number of unique paths to the cell above it and to the cell to its left. We can do this because the robot can only move down or right, so the paths to the current cell must have come from those two directions.

Finally, we return the value at the bottom-right corner of the `dp` array, which represents the number of unique paths the robot can take to reach the destination.

After the loop, if we haven't found any digit less than 9, that means we have a number like 9999...9 which needs to be incremented to 10000...0. So we add a 1 at the beginning of the array (the most significant digit). Finally, we return the incremented array.

Hard,"Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

2. Use `idx` to keep track of the start of the line. `idx` initially starts at 0, i.e., the first word.
3. Calculate the total number of characters from `idx` to the last word in a line by testing whether adding the next word, with an extra space before it, would exceed `maxWidth`.
4. Find the number of gaps in the current line. If it is the last line or there is only one word, left-justify the words and pad the remaining space with spaces.
5. If it's not the last line, distribute spaces as evenly as possible between words: calculate `evenSpaces` and `extraSpaces`, and add an extra space to the left gaps until there are no more `extraSpaces`.
6. Append the constructed line to the result list and update the `idx` to the start of the next line.
7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 until reaching the last word.

1. If either i or j is 0, it means one of the strings is empty, so the minimum number of operations needed is the length of the non-empty string (i or j).
2. If the current characters of the two strings are equal (word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]), we don't have to do anything, so dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1].

Firstly, the number of rows and columns (m and n) are computed. Then, we initialize the left and right pointers (l and r).

In each step of the binary search, we calculate the middle index (mid) and get the corresponding value (mid_val) in the matrix. To get the value in the matrix, we divide mid by n and take the remainder.

We then compare the mid_val with the target. If it is equal to the target, we return true. If it's less than the target, we move the left pointer to the next position (mid + 1). Otherwise, we move the right pointer (mid - 1).

While `white` is less than or equal to `blue`, check the current `nums[white]` value. If it is 0, swap it with the value at index `red`, and increment both `red` and `white`.

    - If valid, update the answer substring's `start` and `length` if the current window's length is less than the current minimum.

Inside the loop, we first calculate the middle index `mid` using the `left` and `right` pointers. If the middle element of the array is equal to the target, we return true, indicating that the target is found.

If the middle element is equal to the left element, we increment the `left` pointer. If the middle element is greater than the left element, we check if the target is within the left and middle elements. If it is, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one. Otherwise, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one.

If the middle element is still smaller than the left element, we then check if the target is within the middle and right elements. If it is, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one. Otherwise, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one.

After the loop, we return false if the target is not found in the array.

    The algorithm uses a dummy node to simplify the handling of the head node of the linked list. We declare two pointers: `prev` and `curr` which are pointers to the previous and current nodes, respectively. 

The algorithm iterates through the list with the current pointer. If the current node's value is equal to the next node's value, we continue moving the current pointer along the duplicate values. Once we reach the end of duplicates, we check if the previous node's next pointer is pointing to the current node. If it is, it means there were no duplicates (prev and curr are consecutive), so we move the `prev` pointer to the current node. Otherwise, we set `prev.next` to `curr.next` to skip the duplicates. 

Finally, we move the current pointer to the next node, and repeat the process. The resulting list will have all duplicates removed, and the changes will persist as the dummy node is used to reference the head of the modified list.

    The algorithm to delete all duplicates in a sorted linked list simply iterates through the list and compares the value of the current node with the value of the next. If both values are the same, it means that there is a duplicate, so the current node's ""next"" pointer is updated to point to the node after the duplicate. If the values are different, the algorithm continues iterating to the next node. The process continues until reaching the end of the list. Since the linked list is already sorted, this algorithm guarantees that duplicates will appear consecutively, allowing for their removal in linear time.

    The algorithm utilizes a stack to keep track of the indices of the heights array. It starts iterating through the array, appending a zero at the end to ensure the last bar is considered. When a higher bar is found, it is pushed onto the stack, and if a lower bar is found, it calculates the area of the bar under the current top of the stack considering the width between the current bar and the next lowest bar in the stack, storing the highest area found.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) as it iterates through the heights only once, resulting in optimal performance.

    The algorithm first sorts the given array, and then it generates all possible subsets. For each subset, it checks if it already exists in the result set. If not, it adds the subset to the result set.

The algorithm uses a backtracking approach. It starts with an empty subset and iteratively adds elements from the input array to the subset. It keeps track of the starting index to avoid creating duplicate subsets.

In the C++ and Java implementations, a `set` data structure is used to store unique subsets. In the Python implementation, Python's `set` is used along with itertools' `combinations` function to achieve the same result. In the JavaScript implementation, a `Set` object is used, but as it doesn't handle array comparisons properly, each subset is converted into a JSON string to compare the string representation of subsets.

At the end, the function returns the result set, converted into the desired format (list of lists or vector of vectors).

Initialize `dp[0]` to 1 because there is always one way to decode an empty string.

For each character in the string `s`, consider its corresponding one-digit and two-digits representations. If the one-digit representation is valid (>=1), we can increment `dp[i]` by `dp[i-1]`, which means one more way to decode the string by using the one-digit representation of the current character. If the two-digits representation is valid (>=10 and <=26), we can increment `dp[i]` by `dp[i-2]`, meaning one way to decode the string by using the two-digits representation of the current character.

After we finished iterating through the string `s`, `dp[n]` will store the number of ways to decode the entire string.

The algorithm iterates through the string s, starting at the current index. It keeps track of the current number (0-255) being constructed by multiplying the current number by 10 and adding the current digit. If the current number is greater than 255, we break the iteration.

We then call the dfs function recursively, with the current index incremented by one, the current IP appended with the current character and a dot, and incrementing part by 1. If the current number is 0 (which indicates a leading zero), we also break the iteration.

**Input:** s1 =  "" "", s2 =  "" "", s3 =  "" ""
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
*   `0 <= s3.length <= 200`
*   `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` consist of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it using only `O(s2.length)` additional memory space?","
    ```python
def isInterleave(s1, s2, s3):
    m, n = len(s1), len(s2)
    if m + n != len(s3):
        return False

    dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = True
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] and s1[i - 1] == s3[i - 1]
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] and s2[j - 1] == s3[j - 1]

    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] and s1[i - 1] == s3[i + j - 1]) or \
                       (dp[i][j - 1] and s2[j - 1] == s3[i + j - 1])

    return dp[m][n]
```
    
    We use a dynamic programming approach (2D DP) to solve this problem. The algorithm checks whether the s3[position] is equal to s1 or s2 in the same dp[position]. If so, we take the value of the previous dp[i-1] or dp[j-1] accordingly if the characters match. For the base case, we start with initializing dp[0][0] to true since two empty strings can form an empty s3.

At the end of the iterations, the last element in the dp matrix (i.e. dp[m][n]) will represent whether s3 can be formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.
    ","Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an **interleaving** of `s1` and `s2`.

An **interleaving** of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where `s` and `t` are divided into `n` and `m` substrings respectively, such that:

*   `s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
*   `t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
*   `|n - m| <= 1`
*   The **interleaving** is `s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ...` or `t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...`

**Note:** `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s1 =  ""aabcc "", s2 =  ""dbbca "", s3 =  ""aadbbcbcac ""
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 =  ""aa "" +  ""bc "" +  ""c "", and s2 into s2 =  ""dbbc "" +  ""a "".
Interleaving the two splits, we get  ""aa "" +  ""dbbc "" +  ""bc "" +  ""a "" +  ""c "" =  ""aadbbcbcac "".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s1 =  ""aabcc "", s2 =  ""dbbca "", s3 =  ""aadbbbaccc ""
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.

    The algorithm follows a simple recursive approach to determine if a given binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST). The key idea is to maintain a range for each node, which is defined by the minimum and maximum values that the node's value should be within. For example, the root node's value should be in the range of (-Infinity, Infinity). When traversing to the left child, the maximum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value, and for traversing to the right child, the minimum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value. The algorithm continues recursively in this manner.

A helper function, `isValidBSTHelper`, is defined and initialized with the root and the range (-Infinity, Infinity). If the node is `null`, it means that we have reached a leaf node and it should return `true`. If the value of the node is not within the specified range, it means that the node does not meet the BST requirement and the helper function should return `false`. If the node is valid, then the helper function proceeds to check for valid BSTs in its left and right subtrees with the updated range.

1. Traverse the BST using Inorder traversal, and at each node, compare its value with the previous node.
2. If the previous node's value is greater than the current node's value, it means they are swapped. So, mark the first such node as `first` and the second such node as `second`.
3. After completing the Inorder traversal, swap the values of the `first` and `second` nodes.
4. This approach is implemented in all four languages: C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.

At each level, the function checks if both nodes are null, indicating we've reached the end of both trees and they must be the same. Then it checks if either node is null, indicating that one tree is missing a node and they cannot be the same.

The function then checks whether the values of both nodes are equal and continues to call itself recursively, but with the arguments changed to evaluate the left subtree and right subtree symmetrically. If the left and right subtrees have symmetric nodes, the function will return true; otherwise, it will return false.

The recursive calls in the helper function flip the direction of traversal for both subtrees to ensure that the subtrees are compared symmetrically. In each recursive call, the appropriate child nodes are visited in opposite directions to make sure they can be properly compared.

    The algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) on both the preorder and inorder traversal results. This algorithm iteratively breaks the inorder sequence into left and right subtrees using the preorder array. The basic idea is that the first element of preorder traversal will always be the root of the tree. Then, we can find that root node's index in the inorder traversal, and create the left subtree from the elements to the left of the index, and the right subtree from the elements to the right of the index. Then we continue this process recursively.

To improve the performance of the search for the index, we can use a map (in C++, Java and JavaScript) or a dictionary (in Python) to store the indices of all elements in the inorder traversal. This way, we don't need to traverse the inorder array every time to find the index of the current element.

Since we're doing this for Python, Java, C++ and JavaScript, some data structures might look a bit different and have different functions to do the same action, but the algorithm used in all languages is the same.

- Preorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- Inorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- A map is used to store the indices for inorder traversal in C++, Java, and JavaScript, while a dictionary is used in Python.
- A helper function is used to recursively construct the tree.
- For Python and JavaScript, the scope of pre_idx is made non-local, so it does not require additional arguments.

The resulting functions return the root node of the reconstructed binary tree.

    We are given the inorder and postorder traversals of a binary tree, and the task is to reconstruct the binary tree from this information. In the postorder traversal, the last element is the root of the tree. Knowing the root, we can divide the inorder traversal into left and right subtrees. With the knowledge of the left subtree size, we can divide the postorder traversal into left and right subtrees as well. We can then recursively build the left and right subtrees, and construct the tree accordingly.

The provided solution maintains a hashmap to keep the indexes of elements in the inorder traversal for easy access during the construction. It uses a helper function `_build` to carry out the recursive construction. The `_build` function takes in the range of elements to be considered in both inorder and postorder traversals and recursively constructs the tree, by dividing the inorder and postorder ranges into left and right subtrees, using the root found in the postorder traversal.

    The algorithm is based on the depth-first search. In this algorithm, we define a helper function named `getHeight` which will return the height of the given subtree if it is balanced, otherwise, it will return -1.

The `getHeight` function works as follows:
1. If the current node is null, return 0 (base case).
2. Call the function recursively for the left subtree (leftHeight) and the right subtree (rightHeight).
3. If either of the subtrees is not balanced or the height difference is greater than 1, return -1.
4. Otherwise, return the maximum height of the left and right subtrees incremented by 1.

The main function `isBalanced` just calls the `getHeight` function and checks whether its result is -1 or not. If it is not -1, the binary tree is height-balanced, otherwise, it is not balanced.
    ","Given a binary tree, determine if it is **height-balanced**.

```
    
    We perform a depth-first search on the tree. The base case would be an empty tree with a depth of 0.

For each non-null subtree, we recursively find the minimum depth of the left and right children. Then, we have three cases:
1. If both left and right children are null, then the current node is a leaf node, and the minimum depth is 1.
2. If either left or right child is null, we return the depth of the other child + 1.
3. If both children are non-null, we take the minimum depth of both children and add 1.

To handle all the cases in a single line, we use a ternary conditional expression in C++, Java, and JavaScript, and use the `and`-`or` short-circuit syntax in Python. We check if either left or right is 0, and in that case return left + right + 1 which handles cases 1 and 2; otherwise, we return the minimum depth of both children + 1, which handles case 3.

    The basic idea of the algorithm is to perform level-order traversal (Breadth First Search) on the binary tree. We use a queue to store the nodes in each level. For each level, we iterate through its nodes, update the `next` pointer, and add their children to the end of the queue. The `prev` variable holds the previous node in the current level. The `next` pointer of the `prev` node is updated to the current node. The variable `prev` is then set to the current node. Repeat this process until the queue is empty which means we have visited all the nodes in the tree.
    ","Given a binary tree

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node \*left;
  Node \*right;
  Node \*next;
}

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3,4,5,null,7\]
**Output:** \[1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#\]
**Explanation:** Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 6000]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**Follow-up:**

*   You may only use constant extra space.
*   The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem. Note that this information might not be relevant to the problem at hand.",,incorrect

    The algorithm iterates through each row of Pascal's Triangle, from 0 to numRows-1, and generates the corresponding row with the required values based on the row index. For each row, it initializes an array or list, and then sets the first element to 1 (since all rows start with 1).

Next, we iterate from the second element to the (i-1)-th element of the row (i being the row index). Each element (at index j) of the row is set to the sum of the two values positioned just above it in the previous row - these values are available at (i-1, j-1) and (i-1, j) in Pascal's Triangle.

If the current row is not the first row, we add another 1 at the end of the row, since all rows end with 1 (except the very first row).

Finally, we append the row to the resulting Pascal's Triangle structure (list of lists or vector of vectors). After completing the loop, the algorithm returns the Pascal's Triangle structure containing numRows.

   a) For each level of BFS, store the current level size, and create an empty set for `current_level` (only in Python & JavaScript).
   b) Iterate for each word in the current BFS level:
      - Dequeue the next `currentWord`, and check for `endWord`; if found return the current `steps` value.
      - Iterate through each character of the `currentWord`; for every character, replace it with 26 possible lowercase alphabets.
        - If the new word is in the `dict` or `word_set`, enqueue it in the queue, and remove it. In Python and JavaScript, also add it to the `current_level` set.
      - Revert the character back to the original character.
   c) Increment the `steps` value by 1, and in Python/javascript, update the `word_set` by removing words present in `current_level`.

Now we iterate through the original array of numbers, and for each number, we check if `(number - 1)` is not in the `elements` set. If it's not in the set, it means we can start counting a new consecutive sequence.
Next, we create two variables, `currentNum` and `currentSeq`, and initialize them with the current number and 1, respectively.
We then use a while loop to check if the next number (`currentNum + 1`) is in the `elements` set. If it is, we increment both `currentNum` and `currentSeq`. This process will continue, finding consecutive elements in the set, until no more consecutive elements are found.
Finally, to get the length of the longest consecutive sequence, we update the `longestSeq` variable by choosing the maximum value between itself and `currentSeq`. This will keep track of the longest consecutive sequence found so far.
The process continues until all numbers in the original array have been checked, and at the end, `longestSeq` will store the answer - the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

    ","Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, _capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by_ `'X'`.

A region is **captured** by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = \[\[ ""X "", ""X "", ""X "", ""X ""\],\[ ""X "", ""O "", ""O "", ""X ""\],\[ ""X "", ""X "", ""O "", ""X ""\],\[ ""X "", ""O "", ""X "", ""X ""\]\]

**Explanation:** Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.

When the search reaches the end of the string, it adds the current list to the results list. After searching at a given position, it backtracks to the previous position and continues to search for palindromes. The overall time complexity is O(N * 2^N) where N is the length of the string.

    The solution uses dynamic programming with an array `dp` of length `n+1` representing  the minimum cuts. `is_palindrome` is a 2D matrix that stores whether the substring from `i` to `j` of string `s` is palindromic or not.

We first initialize the `dp` array with values (i-1) for each index 'i'. This represents the maximum possible cuts needed to satisfy the condition.

Then, we iterate over the string in a nested loop. For each substring `s[i:j]`, we check if it is a palindrome. If it is a palindrome, we'll update the `dp` array with the minimum value between the current value of the `dp` array and the value of the `dp` array at `[i]` plus 1. By doing this, we are considering all possible cuts for a palindromic partition of string `s`.

Finally, we return the last element in the `dp` array, representing the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of string `s`.

```
    
    The algorithm maintains four variables: `total_gas`, `total_cost`, `start`, and `gas_tank`. We initialize these variables to 0. We then loop through each gas station and perform the following steps:

1. Add the gas at the current station to `total_gas`.
2. Add the cost of traveling from this station to the next one to `total_cost`.
3. Add the net gain/loss of gas (gas[i] - cost[i]) to `gas_tank`.
4. If the `gas_tank` is negative, update the `start` position to the next station and reset the `gas_tank` to 0.

After looping through all the gas stations, we check if `total_gas` is greater than or equal to `total_cost`. If it is, we return the `start` position, as this is the first gas station from which we can make a complete trip. If not, we return -1, because it is not possible to complete the circuit. 

This algorithm guarantees a unique solution because if there are multiple valid starting points, there must be a gas station with a lower cost to travel from it to the next station for each solution. As a result, the one with the lowest starting cost would always be chosen, ensuring uniqueness.

    The algorithm takes the following steps to find the minimum number of candies needed to be distributed among the children:
1. Initialize an array or vector 'candies' with the same length as ratings and set all its elements to 1 as every child will have at least 1 candy.
2. Iterate through the ratings array from the second child to the last child. If the rating of the current child is more than the rating of the previous child, update the candies for the current child as candies of the previous child plus 1.
3. Now iterate through the ratings array from the second last child to the first child. If the rating of the current child is more than the rating of the next child, update the candies for the current child as maximum between the candies the child already holds and candies of the next child plus 1.
4. Compute the sum of candies in the candies array or vector.
5. Return the total number of candies needed.

    The algorithm utilizes the XOR bitwise operation. XOR is a binary operation that outputs 1 when the inputs differ and 0 when the inputs are the same. 

To find the single element that appears once in the array, we XOR all elements in the array. Since every pair of identical numbers will cancel each other out as `a ^ a = 0`, the remaining XOR result would be the single unique number, as `0 ^ a = a`.

The algorithm processes the array once, giving it a linear time complexity of O(n), and only requires a constant amount of extra space to store the `result` variable, satisfying the requirements.

    In this problem, we use two variables, ones and twos, to represent the number of occurrences of each bit in the array's elements.

Initially, both ones and twos are set to 0. We use XOR (^) to count the occurrences of each bit in the array. The reason we use XOR is that it cancels out the same bits, so if a bit occurs twice, it will be 0.

We then loop through each element of the array and use XOR to count the bit occurrences. If a bit occurs for the first time, it's XORed into ones; if it occurs for the second time, it's XORed into twos. If it appears for the third time, it should be removed from both ones and twos. To achieve this, we use the bitwise AND (&) along with the bitwise NOT (~) to clear the bits that appear in twos from ones and vice versa.

Finally, after looping through all the elements of the array, the variable ones will only contain the bits that occurred once in the array, and that is our result. So we return the ones variable.

2. Iterate through the interleaved list and assign the `random` pointers of the new nodes. Since the new nodes are right after their corresponding originals, we can easily set the `random` pointers for the new nodes based on the `random` pointers of the original nodes.

    The algorithm used is a combination of depth-first search with memoization. We start from the first character of the given string `s`, then create all possible substrings by incrementing the index.

For each substring, we check if it exists in the dictionary. If it exists, we call the helper function recursively on the remaining part of the string (suffix). This will give us all the possible combinations for the suffix. Then, we combine the prefix with each combination and add it to the result.

Memoization is used to store the results of the helper function for each substring encountered, so that we don't need to compute it multiple times. This speeds up the algorithm by reducing repeated computations.

Finally, we return the list of combinations where all the words are found in the dictionary.

    The algorithm used is Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm, also known as the ""tortoise and the hare"" algorithm. There are two pointers, one slow (tortoise) and another fast (hare). The slow pointer moves one step at a time, and the fast pointer moves two steps. 

Initially, both pointers are set to the head of the linked list. The pointers are moved forward with their respective speeds until either the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list or both pointers meet at the same node. 

If the fast pointer reaches the end, it means that there is no cycle and the function returns false. If the pointers meet at some point in the linked list, there is a cycle and the function returns true.

    The idea of the algorithm is using a stack. Initially, the root node is pushed to the stack. Next, we enter a loop that ends when the stack is empty. In each iteration, we pop a node from the stack, and insert its value at the beginning of the result list (to ensure the correct order for the postorder traversal), then, push its left child, and then its right child to the stack (if they are not null). In the end, we return the result list. The algorithm is non-recursive which makes it easier to understand for some. Since the result list will store the output in reversed order, this iterative version avoids the necessity of reversing the final output.

    The insertion sort algorithm for a linked list involves iterating through the list, removing one element at a time, and inserting it into the sorted sublist. We use a dummy node to act as the head of the sorted sublist, which initially has no elements. In each iteration, we compare the current element (its value) to the elements in the sorted sublist, and insert it into its proper position. This is done by updating the ""next"" pointers for the appropriate nodes. The process is repeated until all elements from the original list have been processed and added to the sorted sublist. At the end, the sorted sublist is returned, starting from the next node after the dummy head node.

In Python, we can simply use `split()` since it splits on whitespace by default and ignores leading and trailing spaces.

2. Reverse the array of words. In C++, we use the `reverse` function from the `algorithm` library. In Java, we can use `Collections.reverse()` method. In Python, we use list `reverse()` method. In JavaScript, we use the `reverse()` method on the array.

3. Join the reversed array of words into a single string with a space delimiter. In C++, we concatenate words with a space but avoid adding an extra space at the end. In Java, we use `String.join()`, in Python, use `join()` on the delimiter string, and in JavaScript, use `join()` on the array.

    The algorithm maintains the maximum and minimum product subarray ending at the current position. For each position, it checks if the current element is negative. If it is, it swaps the maximum and minimum product subarray, since multiplying by a negative number reverses their order.

After the swap, it calculates the maximum and minimum product subarray ending at the current position by considering the current element and the product of the maximum and minimum product subarray ending at the previous position, multiplied by the current element. It updates the result as the maximum of the result and the maximum product subarray ending at the current position.

This process continues for all elements of the array, and the result is returned.

    The algorithm uses a binary search approach to find the minimum element in the sorted rotated array. Initially, pointers `left` and `right` are set to the start and end of the array. The midpoint `mid` is calculated as the average of `left` and `right`. The main idea is that whenever `nums[mid]` is greater than `nums[right]`, the minimum element must be in the right half of the array; otherwise, we search in the left half. This ensures that the algorithm runs in O(log n) time, as the search space is reduced by half each iteration. When `left` and `right` meet, the minimum element is found at `left`.

1. Calculate mid index.
2. If nums[mid] is greater than nums[high], it means the minimum element lies in the right half of the array, so we set low to mid + 1.
3. If nums[mid] is less than nums[high], it means the minimum element lies in the left half of the array, so we set high to mid.
4. If nums[mid] is equal to nums[high], we cannot be certain in which half the minimum element lies, so we simply decrement high by 1.

Now buf4 =  ""abcd "", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  ""e "", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  "" "", fp points to end of file`

    The algorithm relies on the read4 function provided, which reads 4 characters at a time. We read and store these characters in a buffer (`buf4`) and then transfer them one by one into the destination buffer (`buf`) until we reach the desired number of characters (`n`). We repeat this process until we have read `n` characters or reached the end of the `file`. If we reach the end of the file, the read4 function will return less than 4 characters, which is detected and used to break the loop.

In each language, we declare a buffer `buf4` of length 4 to store the characters read using the read4 function. We keep track of the total characters read (`totalRead`) and iterate through the characters in `buf4`, transferring them one by one to the destination buffer `buf`. We make sure not to exceed the requested number of characters `n`.

Once we reach the end of the file, the read4 function will return less than 4 characters. If this happens, we break the loop and return the total number of characters read, which is stored in `totalRead`.

Hard,"Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method `read` to read `n` characters. Your method `read` may be **called multiple times**.

**Method read4:**

The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

File file( ""abcde `""); // File is  ""`abcde `"", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  ""abcd "", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  ""e "", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  "" "", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The read function may be **called multiple times**.
*   Please remember to **RESET** your class variables declared in Solution, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see [here](https://leetcode.com/faq/) for more details.

    The algorithm uses a buffer `buf4` to store characters read from the `read4` method. We initialize two variables, `buffer_index` to keep track of the current position in `buf4` and `buffer_len` to store the number of characters read from `read4`.

In the `read` method, the first step is to check if we need to read more characters from `read4`. This is done by checking if `buffer_index` is equal to `buffer_len`. If it is, then we call `read4` and reset the `buffer_index` to 0.

If the number of characters read from `read4` is 0, then we have reached the end of the file, so we break out of the loop.

Next, we copy the characters from `buf4` to the destination buffer `buf` until either we have read enough characters (`cnt` equals `n`), or there are no more characters to copy from `buf4` (`buffer_index` equals `buffer_len`). After copying characters, we increment `cnt` and `buffer_index` accordingly.

When the loop is finished, the result is the total number of characters read, which is stored in `cnt`.

We iterate through the string with pointer `r`. For each character, we increment its count in the hash map. If we have two or fewer distinct characters in the current substring, we update the current length `cur_len`. If we have more than two distinct characters, we move the pointer `l` to the right, decrementing the count of the character at `l` in the hash map, and removing it if its count becomes zero. We update `cur_len` accordingly in the process.

At each step, we update the maximum length `max_len` with the maximum of `max_len` and `cur_len`. We return `max_len` at the end.

Easy,"Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

*   `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
*   `listA` - The first linked list.
*   `listB` - The second linked list.
*   `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 8, listA = \[4,1,8,4,5\], listB = \[5,6,1,8,4,5\], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[4,1,8,4,5\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[5,6,1,8,4,5\]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 2, listA = \[1,9,1,2,4\], listB = \[3,2,4\], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
**Output:** Intersected at '2'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[1,9,1,2,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[3,2,4\]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = \[2,6,4\], listB = \[1,5\], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[2,6,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[1,5\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

*   `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

    The algorithm uses two pointers, one for each linked list head (headA and headB). The pointers traverse through the lists such that they traverse the sum of the node count of both lists. If the lists intersect at a node, the pointers will eventually meet at this intersection node because they will have traversed the same number of total nodes. If the lists do not intersect, the pointers will meet at the end of the lists, resulting in both pointers being null, and the function will return null.

Medium,"A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

    For this problem, we can use the binary search. Instead of comparing the mid-element to the target value, we compare it with its neighbors. Based on the comparison, we adjust the left and right pointers accordingly:

1. Initialize left and right pointer, `left = 0` and `right = nums.length - 1`.
2. While `left < right`, do the following:
   a. Calculate the mid index, `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`.
   b. If `nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]`, move the left pointer to `mid + 1`.
   c. Else, move the right pointer to the `mid`.
3. When `left >= right`, the peak index is found, so return `left`.

Since we use a binary search, the algorithm runs in O(log n) time.

    The algorithm first finds the minimum and maximum values of the input array `nums`.

The algorithm then initializes an array of buckets, where each bucket contains the minimum and maximum values of its elements.

Next, the algorithm updates the minimum and maximum values for each bucket appropriately by iterating through the input array. Finally, the algorithm calculates the maximum gap by finding the difference between the minimum value of the current bucket and the maximum value of the previous non-empty bucket, and updating the maximum gap value accordingly.

This algorithm runs in linear time, because it iterates through the input array once to fill the buckets, and then it iterates through the buckets once to compute the maximum gap. It also uses linear extra space, as the number of buckets is proportional to the length of the input array.
