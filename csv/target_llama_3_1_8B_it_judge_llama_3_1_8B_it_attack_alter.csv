Easy,"Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = \[2,7,11,15\], target = 9
**Output:** \[0,1\]
**Explanation:** Because nums\[0\] + nums\[1\] == 9, we return \[0, 1\].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,2,4\], target = 6
**Output:** \[1,2\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = \[3,3\], target = 6
**Output:** \[0,1\]

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
*   `-109 <= target <= 109`
*   **Only one valid answer exists.**

**Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?","
    ```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in map:
            return [map[complement], i]
        map[num] = i
    return []
```
    
    The algorithm leverages a hash map (unordered_map in C++, HashMap in Java, dictionary in Python, and Map in JavaScript). It iterates through the given 'nums' array and calculates the complementary value (target - current value). If the complementary value is already in the hash map, it means that we found a solution, and we return those indices. If the complement is not in the hash map, we store the current element in the hash map with its index. If the algorithm doesn't find the solution, it returns an empty array or throws an exception (in Java).

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n) as well.

1. Initialize left and right pointers to the start of the string, and maxLength to 0.
2. Check if the character at the right index is in the set.
   - If it's not in the set, add the character to the set, update maxLength, and move the right pointer forward.

    The algorithm initializes `res` as 0. Then, we determine the sign of the input integer and take its absolute value. We use a while loop to iterate through each digit of `x` from right to left. In each iteration, we multiply the current `res` by 10 and add the last digit of `x` to it. The last digit of `x` is obtained by `x % 10`. After adding the last digit, we remove it from `x` by doing either `x /= 10` or `x //= 10`.

After processing all the digits, we adjust `res` with the sign we computed earlier. Finally, we check if the reversed integer is within the 32-bit integer range. If it is, we return the result; otherwise, we return 0.

Medium,"Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1.  Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
2.  Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
3.  Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
4.  Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `""123 "" -> 123`, `""0032 "" -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
5.  If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.

If the current characters in `s` and `p` are equal or `p` has a '.', we update the `dp[i][j]` to the value `dp[i - 1][j - 1]`, because the match continues.

If the current character in `p` is '*', we have two options:

1. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as 0 occurrences. We update the `dp[i][j]` value to `dp[i][j - 2]`.

If the height at the left pointer is less than the height at the right pointer, it moves the left pointer to the right. Otherwise, it moves the right pointer to the left. The algorithm continues until the pointers meet.

This algorithm ensures that the maximum area is found without having to check all possible pairs of lines because it always chooses the pair of lines with the maximum possible distance and minimum height difference at each step.

    1. Sort the input array `nums`.
2. Loop through `nums` from index `0` to `length - 2`. Let the current index be `i`.
    - If `i` is `0` or `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous element (`nums[i - 1]`), perform the following steps:
        - Initialize two pointers `j` and `k`, where `j` is the next index after `i`, and `k` is the last index of `nums`.
        - While `j` is less than `k`, perform the following steps:
            - Calculate the sum `s` of the elements at indices `i`, `j`, and `k`.
            - If the sum `s` is equal to `0`, then we've found a valid triplet. Add it to the `result` array and move the pointers, `j` and `k`, skipping duplicates if any.
            - If the sum `s` is less than `0`, increment `j` to move towards positive values.
            - If the sum `s` is greater than `0`, decrement `k` to move towards negative values.
3. Return the `result` array.

The algorithm removes duplicates by checking if the current numbers being processed are equal to previously processed numbers. The sorting step helps in simplifying the algorithm and reducing the search space.
    ","Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 1`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** nums = \[-0,1,0,3,-2,-3\]
**Output:** \[\[-2,-0,3\],\[-0,-1,0\]\]

nums\[0\] + nums\[3\] + nums\[3\] = 1 + 2 + (-2) = 1.
nums\[1\] + nums\[4\] + nums\[5\] = (-2) + 3 + (-2) = 1.
The distinct triplets are \[-2,1,0\] and \[-2,-2,1\].

When an open bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. When a close bracket is encountered, the algorithm checks if the stack is empty or the corresponding open bracket is not at the top of the stack. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns false. If not, the open bracket is popped from the stack. After iterating through the entire string, the function checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is not empty, the function returns false, indicating there were unmatched open braces.

    The algorithm uses a helper function called `generateParenthesisHelper` which receives four parameters: the number of open parentheses left to place, the number of close parentheses left to place, the current string that holds the generated parentheses so far, and the result list to store valid combinations.

The algorithm uses a depth-first search to construct valid combinations of parentheses. It starts with `n` open parentheses and increments the number of close parentheses as it places an open parenthesis. When the helper function has no open or close parentheses left to place, it means a valid combination is found, so it adds the combination to the result list.

The helper function recursively calls itself. If there are open parentheses left to place, it calls itself with one less open parenthesis and one more close parenthesis. If there are close parentheses left to place, it calls itself without changing the number of open parentheses and with one less close parenthesis. Finally, the current string in each case is updated with the placed open or close parenthesis.

    The algorithm follows a divide and conquer approach to merge all linked lists into one sorted linked-list. 

1. If the given array of linked-lists is empty, we return a null pointer.
2. The main function `mergeKLists` merges the first two lists in the array of linked-lists and appends the results (merged list) at the end of the array. It will then remove the merged lists from the beginning of the array. This process is repeated until only one linked-list remains in the array.
3. The function `merge2Lists` is used for merging two sorted linked-lists. The smallest element of the two lists is chosen as the head node and recursively merged with the rest of the lists.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(kN) and a space complexity of O(1), where k is the number of linked-lists, and N is the total number of nodes across all linked-lists.

    1. First, we count the length of the linked list.
2. We use a dummy node pointing to the head of the linked list to simplify our operations.
3. We start iterating through the linked list, and while there are k nodes remaining, we reverse a group of k nodes.
4. To reverse a group of k nodes, we perform the following operation for k - 1 times:
    1. Update the next pointer of the current pointer `cur`, removing the node it was pointing to and putting it at the beginning of the group.
    2. Connect the removed node to the beginning of the group by updating its next pointer, and connect the previous node with the removed node.
5. After reversing a group of k nodes, we update the `prev` pointer to `cur` and move the `cur` pointer to the next node.
6. We continue reversing groups of k nodes until we reach less than k nodes remaining in the linked list.
7. Finally, we return the next pointer of the dummy node as our new head node.
    ","Given the `head` of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return _the modified list_.

`k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** head = \[0,1,2,5,6\], k = 3
**Output:** \[3,2,3,2,6\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = \[0,3,4,5,4\], k = 2
**Output:** \[4,3,2,5,6\]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
*   `2 <= k <= n <= 5001`
*   `-1 <= Node.val <= 1001`

**Follow-up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(2)` extra memory space?","python

    We use two pointers `i` and `j`. `i` starts at the first element and `j` at the second. We go through the array with `j` and compare the elements at the two pointers. If they are different, it means we found a unique element, so we move `i` to the next position and copy the value from `j` to `i`. When we finish going through the array, the length of the unique part is `i+1`.

    The algorithm uses two pointers approach. The pointer `i` maintains the position where the next non-val element should be placed, and pointer `j` iterates through the array. If the element at `j` is not equal to `val`, we place it at the position `i` and increment the `i` pointer. The loop continues until we have checked all the elements in the array. The `i` pointer will give us the count of elements that are not equal to `val`, which is the result. Thus, we return the value of `i` as the final result.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, as we only iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) since we do not use any extra memory. We modify the input array in-place.

    1. First, we handle the edge case where dividend = -2^31 and divisor = -1. The result must be 2^31, but since it's out of the signed integer range, we should return 2^31 - 1.
2. Calculate the sign of the result based on the signs of dividend and divisor.
3. We use the bitwise shift operator to handle divisions by powers of 2. In each iteration, we initialize the temp variable as the absolute value of the divisor to calculate how many times it fits into the remaining dividend. We then use another loop to repeatedly double the temp variable (by bitwise left shift) and check if the dividend is still greater or equal. If so, we also double the 'multiple' value associated with temp, as that's the actual quotient in the current iteration.
4. When the shifting loop exits, we subtract the current temp from dividend and accumulate the current multiple to our answer.
5. Once the dividend is less than the divisor, we break the loop and return the signed quotient by multiplying the sign variable to our answer.

*   For example, if `words = [ ""ab "", ""cd "", ""ef ""]`, then `""abcdef ""`, `""abefcd ""`, `""cdabef ""`, `""cdefab ""`, `""efabcd ""`, and `""efcdab ""` are all concatenated strings. `""acdbef ""` is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of `words`.

Return _the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in_ `s`. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""barfoothefoobarman "", words = \[ ""foo "", ""bar ""\]
**Output:** \[0,9\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 2 and words\[i\].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.
The substring starting at 0 is  ""barfoo "". It is the concatenation of \[ ""bar "", ""foo ""\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is  ""foobar "". It is the concatenation of \[ ""foo "", ""bar ""\] which is a permutation of words.
The output order does not matter. Returning \[9,0\] is fine too.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""wordgoodgoodgoodbestword "", words = \[ ""word "", ""good "", ""best "", ""word ""\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 4 and words\[i\].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.
There is no substring of length 16 is s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.
We return an empty array.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s =  ""barfoofoobarthefoobarman "", words = \[ ""bar "", ""foo "", ""the ""\]
**Output:** \[6,9,12\]
**Explanation:** Since words.length == 3 and words\[i\].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 9.
The substring starting at 6 is  ""foobarthe "". It is the concatenation of \[ ""foo "", ""bar "", ""the ""\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is  ""barthefoo "". It is the concatenation of \[ ""bar "", ""the "", ""foo ""\] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 12 is  ""thefoobar "". It is the concatenation of \[ ""the "", ""foo "", ""bar ""\] which is a permutation of words.

    We can solve this problem by following the steps below:

1. Identify the largest index `k` such that `nums[k] < nums[k + 1]`. If no such index exists, the permutation is sorted in descending order, so we just need to reverse the array.
2. Identify the largest index `l` greater than `k` such that `nums[k] < nums[l]`.
3. Swap the value of `nums[k]` with that of `nums[l]`.
4. Reverse the sub-array `nums[k + 1:]` which is guaranteed to be in non-increasing order.

    The given problem requires a binary search algorithm. We define two pointers, `left` and `right`, initially set to the first and last index of the array. We then enter a loop that continues as long as left is less than or equal to right. Inside the loop, we calculate the middle index, `mid`, as the average of left and right. If the value at this middle index is equal to the target value, we return the middle index. If the middle value is less than the target value, we set left to `mid + 1`, meaning we search the right half of the remaining array. If the middle value is greater than the target value, we set the right to `mid - 1`, meaning we search the left half of the remaining array. After the loop, if the target value is not found, we return the value of the left pointer, which represents the index where the target value should be inserted.

    1. The algorithm starts by searching for an empty cell (denoted by '.').
2. Once an empty cell is found, it tries to insert a number from 1 to 9.
3. For each inserted number, it checks if its placement is valid based on Sudoku rules:
   - The number must not be present in the same row or column.
   - The number must not be present in its corresponding 3x3 grid.
4. It calls itself (backtracks) recursively whenever a valid number is inserted into the cell.
5. If inserting a number fails to lead to a valid solution, the algorithm reverts that cell to '.' and tries the next number.
6. The process is repeated until a valid board is created or all possibilities have failed.
7. Once an empty cell is not found, it considers the board solved and exits the process.

0.  Each of the digits `0-10` must occur exactly once in each row.
3.  Each of the digits `0-10` must occur exactly once in each column.
4.  Each of the digits `2-8` must occur exactly once in each of the 10 `4x2` sub-boxes of the grid.

The `'.'` character indicates empty cells.

    The algorithm is a recursive solution. It starts with the base case, when `n` is 1, it returns the first term of the sequence ""1"". In other cases, it makes a recursive call to the function with `n-1` to get the previous term in the sequence. Then it iterates through the previous term, comparing each character with the previous one to count the number of consecutive equal digits. When it encounters a different character, it appends the count and the character to the result string and resets the count to 1.

    The algorithm is a recursive backtracking algorithm. We define a helper function `findCombinations` that takes the following parameters:

1. `startIndex`: the index of the candidates array from which it can start choosing numbers.
2. `remaining`: the remaining sum needed to reach the target.

The base cases are:
- If `remaining` is 0, it means we have found a valid combination, so we return a list containing an empty list.
- If `startIndex` is equal to the length of candidates, or `remaining` is negative, there are no valid combinations, so we return an empty list.

In the function, we first initialize an empty list called `result`. Then, we make two recursive calls to `findCombinations`:

1. Excluding the current candidate at `startIndex` and incrementing `startIndex`, to search for combinations without this candidate.
2. Including the current candidate in the combination, and decreasing `remaining` accordingly (without updating `startIndex`).

After getting results from both recursive calls, we merge them and return the final list of combinations.

The main function `combinationSum` calls `findCombinations` with `startIndex` as 0 and `remaining` as the target, and returns the result after the recursion is done.

    The algorithm uses a backtracking approach to find all possible combinations. It starts by sorting the input `candidates` array/list. Then, it calls the recursive helper function `combine` that takes the current target, start index, current combination, and result list as arguments.

1. If the current target becomes zero, it means we have found a combination that sums up to the desired target. Add the current combination to the result list and return.
2. Iterate through the `candidates` list starting from the given index.
   - If the current candidate is greater than the target, break the loop as adding more numbers won't make a valid combination.
   - Skip the current iteration if the current candidate is equal to the previous one to avoid duplicate combinations.
   - Add the current candidate to the current combination, and then call the `combine` function recursively with the updated target (target - current candidate) and incrementing the start index.
   - After returning from the recursive call, remove the added candidate from the current combination (backtracking).

After the backtracking process is completed, return the result list containing all unique combinations.

    The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach, initializing left and right pointers to the beginning and end of the elevation map, respectively. It also initializes two variables `maxLeft` and `maxRight` to keep track of the maximum heights on the left and right of the pointers, as well as a variable `water` to store the trapped water.

The algorithm iterates through the elevation map until the left pointer is less than the right pointer. In each iteration, it compares the values at both pointers to determine which side is shorter. If the value at the left pointer is less than or equal to the value at the right pointer, it means water can be trapped on the left side up to the height of the shorter bar. The algorithm updates `maxLeft` with the maximum height on the left side and then adds the trapped water (which is the difference between the maximum height and the current height) to the `water` variable. The left pointer is then incremented. If the value at the right pointer is smaller, the same logic is applied to the right side and the right pointer is decremented.

This process is repeated until the left pointer is no longer less than the right pointer, at which point the total trapped water has been calculated and the `water` variable is returned. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) as it only uses constant extra space.

1. The base case is when the index reaches the last element of the array; at this point, we append the current configuration to the ""results"" list.

This will generate all possible permutations, as it swaps elements in different positions while maintaining the original order in the input array.

    We use backtracking to generate permutations. Firstly, we sort the `nums` array to make sure that duplicate numbers are located together. Then, for each recursive backtracking call, we swap the elements in the range `[start, len(nums) - 1]` with `nums[start]`, ignoring already-visited elements by using a `visited` array.

We also skip any element that is equal to the current `start` element to avoid duplicates. After generating a valid permutation by iterating through all indices, we append the current permutation to the result array. When backtracking, we maintain the original order of elements before moving to the next level.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n! * n) since there are n! available permutations and each permutation requires O(n) time to build the solution. The space complexity is O(n) to store the `visited` array and temporary lists.

    The algorithm uses the binary exponentiation technique, which is a faster method of calculating x^n compared to the naive approach. It relies on the process of repeatedly multiplying the current product by itself and updating it after each iteration. The loop iterates through the bits of the exponent n, from the least significant to the most significant. If the current bit of n is 1, the result is multiplied by the current product. At the end of the loop, the current product is updated by squaring it. This process continues until all bits of the exponent have been processed.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log(n)) because the loop iterates through the bits of n, and the number of bits in n is proportional to the logarithm of n. The space complexity is O(1), as the space used by the temporary variables does not depend on the size of n.

When placing a queen, check if that position is safe from all previously placed queens in terms of the horizontal, diagonal, and anti-diagonal directions. If the selected position is safe, move on to the next column and try to place another queen there. If no safe positions are found in the current column, then go back to the previous column and move the queen to another safe position.

4. If the current position is safe, place the queen in the current column at the current row position, and continue to place the next queen.
5. If all queens are placed, increment the solution count.
6. If the recursive call finishes, backtrack by removing the queen from the current column and move on to the next row in the same column.
7. The base case is when the `cols` size equals `n`, meaning all queens have been placed safely; increment the count.

This approach considers all possible configurations for placing the n queens while avoiding visiting invalid configurations. It uses backtracking to explore the state space efficiently. The algorithm finds the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

For each element, we compare the sum of the current_sum with the element itself, and select the maximum of the two. This helps us to decide whether to continue the current contiguous subarray or start a new one from that element. Then, we compare the new current_sum with our global max_sum, and update max_sum if we find a larger value.

In the end, max_sum contains the largest sum of the contiguous subarray.

    The algorithm for finding the length of the last word in a string containing multiple words separated by spaces is as follows:

1. Initialize variables for the length of the last word and the tail (i.e., the end) of the input string.
2. Traverse the string in reverse order to find the start of the last word by checking if a character is a space. Skip all spaces found.
3. Continue traversing the string in reverse order and record the length of the last word until a space is encountered or the start of the string is reached.
4. Return the length of the last word.

This algorithm is implemented in each of the given programming languages (C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript) with the appropriate syntax and variable initialization. The functions are named `lengthOfLastWord` for C++, Java, and JavaScript, and `length_of_last_word` for Python.

Then, for every other cell in the `dp` array, we can calculate the number of unique paths to that cell by summing the number of unique paths to the cell above it and to the cell to its left.

3. For all other elements, find the minimum path/components from its top (i-1,j) and left (i,j-1) neighbors, and then add its current value.

1. `^`: Start of the string
2. `[-+]?`: An optional sign, either `+` or `-`
3. `(`: Start of a group that can be an integer or a decimal
4. `(([0-9]+(\\.[0-9]*)?)|(\\.[0-9]+))`: Here, a valid number can either have digits before and after the decimal point or only after the decimal point (or only before the decimal point with an optional decimal delimiter).

Hard,"Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

2. Use `idx` to keep track of the start of the line. `idx` initially starts at 0, i.e., the first word.
3. Calculate the total number of characters from `idx` to the last word in a line by testing whether adding the next word, with an extra space before it, would exceed `maxWidth`.
4. Find the number of gaps in the current line. If it is the last line or there is only one word, left-justify the words and pad the remaining space with spaces.
5. If it's not the last line, distribute spaces as evenly as possible between words: calculate `evenSpaces` and `extraSpaces`, and add an extra space to the left gaps until there are no more `extraSpaces`.
6. Append the constructed line to the result list and update the `idx` to the start of the next line.
7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 until reaching the last word.
8. Return the result list.
    ","Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

*   A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
*   Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than `1` and not exceed `maxWidth`.
*   The input array `words` contains at least one word.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** words = \[ ""This "",  ""is "",  ""an "",  ""example "",  ""of "",  ""text "",  ""justification. ""\], maxWidth = 17
**Output:**
\[
    ""This    is    an "",
    ""example  of text "",
    ""justification.   ""
\]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = \[ ""What "", ""must "", ""be "", ""acknowledgment "", ""shall "", ""be ""\], maxWidth = 15
**Output:**
\[
   ""What   must   be "",
   ""acknowledgment   "",
   ""shall be         ""
\]
**Explanation:** Note that the last line is  ""shall be     "" instead of  ""shall     be "", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** words = \[ ""Science "", ""is "", ""what "", ""we "", ""understand "", ""well "", ""enough "", ""to "", ""explain "", ""to "", ""a "", ""computer. "", ""Art "", ""is "", ""everything "", ""else "", ""we "", ""do ""\], maxWidth = 19

    The algorithm uses binary search on an m x n matrix.

Firstly, the number of rows and columns (m and n) are computed. Then, we initialize the left and right pointers (l and r).

In each step of the binary search, we calculate the middle index (mid) and get the corresponding value (mid_val) in the matrix. To get the value in the matrix, we divide mid by n and take the remainder.

We then compare the mid_val with the target. If it is equal to the target, we return true. If it's less than the target, we move the left pointer to the next position (mid + 1). Otherwise, we move the right pointer (mid - 1).

If the search space has been fully explored and the target is not found, we return false.

    The algorithm can be explained using three pointers: `red`, `white`, and `blue`. `red` is responsible for tracking the position where the next 0 should be moved to, starting from the beginning of the array. Likewise, `blue` is responsible for tracking the position where the next 2 should be swapped to, starting from the end of the array. `white` is responsible for iterating through the array.

While `white` is less than or equal to `blue`, check the current `nums[white]` value. If it is 0, swap it with the value at index `red`, and increment both `red` and `white`. If it is 1, simply increment `white`. If it is 2, swap the value at index `white` with the value at index `blue`, and decrement `blue` without incrementing `white` since the newly swapped value at index `white` might be 0 or 2.

This will sort the colors in the required order with a linear-time complexity, as we only go through the array once with the `white` pointer. Also, it sorts the colors in-place without the need for additional storage.

    - If valid, update the answer substring's `start` and `length` if the current window's length is less than the current minimum.

Inside the loop, we first calculate the middle index `mid` using the `left` and `right` pointers. If the middle element of the array is equal to the target, we return true, indicating that the target is found.

If the middle element is equal to the left element, we increment the `left` pointer. If the middle element is greater than the left element, we check if the target is within the left and middle elements. If it is, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one. Otherwise, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one.

If the middle element is still smaller than the left element, we then check if the target is within the middle and right elements. If it is, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one. Otherwise, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one.

    The algorithm uses a dummy node to simplify the handling of the head node of the linked list. We declare two pointers: `prev` and `curr` which are pointers to the previous and current nodes, respectively. 

The algorithm iterates through the list with the current pointer. If the current node's value is equal to the next node's value, we continue moving the current pointer along the duplicate values. Once we reach the end of duplicates, we check if the previous node's next pointer is pointing to the current node. If it is, it means there were no duplicates (prev and curr are consecutive), so we move the `prev` pointer to the current node. Otherwise, we set `prev.next` to `curr.next` to skip the duplicates. 

Finally, we move the current pointer to the next node, and repeat the process. The resulting list will have all duplicates removed, and the changes will persist as the dummy node is used to reference the head of the modified list.

    The algorithm to delete all duplicates in a sorted linked list simply iterates through the list and compares the value of the current node with the value of the next. If both values are the same, it means that there is a duplicate, so the current node's ""next"" pointer is updated to point to the node after the duplicate. If the values are different, the algorithm continues iterating to the next node. The process continues until reaching the end of the list. Since the linked list is already sorted, this algorithm guarantees that duplicates will appear consecutively, allowing for their removal in linear time.

**Example 1:**

    The algorithm works by recursively dividing the strings into smaller substrings and checking if the substrings from s1 can be rearranged into the corresponding substrings of s2. The base case is when both strings (s1, and s2) are equal. If the lengths of the strings are different or the characters are different, then the function returns false. Then, we iterate through the length of strings, dividing the strings into smaller substrings and checking if these substrings can be rearranged to form the scrambled string. We check for both possible arrangements of the substrings, i.e., same order and reverse order, invoking the same function recursively for each combination.

    *   **Randomly** decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, `s` may become `s = x + y` or `s = y + x`.
    *   Apply step 0 recursively on each of the two substrings `x` and `y`.

Given two strings `s0` and `s1` of **the same length**, return `true` if `s3` is a scrambled string of `s2`, otherwise, return `false`.

Easy,"You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array_ `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = \[1,2,3,0,0,0\], m = 3, nums2 = \[2,5,6\], n = 3
**Output:** \[1,2,2,3,5,6\]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are \[1,2,3\] and \[2,5,6\].
The result of the merge is \[1,2,2,3,5,6\] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

        nums1[k] = nums2[j]
        k -= 1

```
    
    We use a two-pointer approach to merge nums1 and nums2 in reverse order. Initialize three pointers i, j, and k pointing to the last elements of nums1, nums2, and the merged nums1 array respectively.

Iterate in a while loop until i and j are both less than 0. Compare the values of nums1[i] and nums2[j]. If nums1[i] is greater, assign nums1[i] at position k in nums1, decrement i and k. Otherwise, assign nums2[j] at position k in nums1, and decrement j and k. This process continues for all elements in nums2.

After the loop, if there are still elements remaining in nums2 (j >= 0), copy the remaining elements of nums2 to nums1. In this way, we merge nums1 and nums2 in non-decreasing order.

    The algorithm first sorts the given array, and then it generates all possible subsets. For each subset, it checks if it already exists in the result set. If not, it adds the subset to the result set.

The algorithm uses a backtracking approach. It starts with an empty subset and iteratively adds elements from the input array to the subset. It keeps track of the starting index to avoid creating duplicate subsets.

In the C++ and Java implementations, a `set` data structure is used to store unique subsets. In the Python implementation, Python's `set` is used along with itertools' `combinations` function to achieve the same result. In the JavaScript implementation, a `Set` object is used, but as it doesn't handle array comparisons properly, each subset is converted into a JSON string to compare the string representation of subsets.

At the end, the function returns the result set, converted into the desired format (list of lists or vector of vectors).

Initialize `dp[0]` to 1 because there is always one way to decode an empty string.

For each character in the string `s`, consider its corresponding one-digit and two-digits representations. If the one-digit representation is valid (>=1), we can increment `dp[i]` by `dp[i-1]`, which means one more way to decode the string by using the one-digit representation of the current character. If the two-digits representation is valid (>=10 and <=26), we can increment `dp[i]` by `dp[i-2]`, meaning one way to decode the string by using the two-digits representation of the current character.

After we finished iterating through the string `s`, `dp[n]` will store the number of ways to decode the entire string.

    We use a Depth-First Search algorithm to explore all possible configurations of the IP address. The function takes in the input string (s), the starting index (start), the partially constructed IP address (ip), and the current part count (part).

In each call to the function, we try to add one part to the IP address. If 4 parts have been added and we have reached the end of the input string, we have found a valid IP address and add it to the result list.

The algorithm iterates through the string s, starting at the current index. It keeps track of the current number (0-255) being constructed by multiplying the current number by 10 and adding the current digit. If the current number is greater than 255, we break the iteration.

We then call the dfs function recursively, with the current index incremented by one, the current IP appended with the current character and a dot, and incrementing part by 1. If the current number is 0 (which indicates a leading zero), we also break the iteration.

This process is repeated for all valid parts and combinations, eventually forming all possible valid IP addresses.
    ","A **valid IP address** consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots. Each integer is between `1` and `254` (**inclusive**) and cannot have leading zeros.

2. Visit the root.

    The algorithm follows a simple recursive approach to determine if a given binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST). The key idea is to maintain a range for each node, which is defined by the minimum and maximum values that the node's value should be within. For example, the root node's value should be in the range of (-Infinity, Infinity). When traversing to the left child, the maximum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value, and for traversing to the right child, the minimum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value. The algorithm continues recursively in this manner.

A helper function, `isValidBSTHelper`, is defined and initialized with the root and the range (-Infinity, Infinity). If the node is `null`, it means that we have reached a leaf node and it should return `true`. If the value of the node is not within the specified range, it means that the node does not meet the BST requirement and the helper function should return `false`. If the node is valid, then the helper function proceeds to check for valid BSTs in its left and right subtrees with the updated range.

    We will solve this problem using the Inorder traversal of the binary search tree.

1. Traverse the BST using Inorder traversal, and at each node, compare its value with the previous node.
2. If the previous node's value is greater than the current node's value, it means they are swapped. So, mark the first such node as `first` and the second such node as `second`.
3. After completing the Inorder traversal, swap the values of the `first` and `second` nodes.
4. This approach is implemented in all four languages: C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.

Note that the TreeNode class should be defined for each implementation as it's not provided in the problem statement.

It will compare the nodes at each level of the tree, and return false if the nodes have different values or if one node is missing in one of the trees. The algorithm will only return true if all nodes in both trees are the same.

At each level, the function checks if both nodes are null, indicating we've reached the end of both trees and they must be the same. Then it checks if either node is null, indicating that one tree is missing a node and they cannot be the same. If both nodes have the same value, we then recursively check their left and right children. If both children are the same, the function returns true. If at any point nodes are found to be different, the function returns false.

The base cases for this helper function are when both nodes are null, in which case the function should return true, or when one of the nodes is null, in which case the function should return false.

The function then checks whether the values of both nodes are equal and continues to call itself recursively, but with the arguments changed to evaluate the left subtree and right subtree symmetrically. If the left and right subtrees have symmetric nodes, the function will return true; otherwise, it will return false.

The recursive calls in the helper function flip the direction of traversal for both subtrees to ensure that the subtrees are compared symmetrically. In each recursive call, the appropriate child nodes are visited in opposite directions to make sure they can be properly compared.

    The algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) on both the preorder and inorder traversal results. This algorithm iteratively breaks the inorder sequence into left and right subtrees using the preorder array. The basic idea is that the first element of preorder traversal will always be the root of the tree. Then, we can find that root node's index in the inorder traversal, and create the left subtree from the elements to the left of the index, and the right subtree from the elements to the right of the index. Then we continue this process recursively.

To improve the performance of the search for the index, we can use a map (in C++, Java and JavaScript) or a dictionary (in Python) to store the indices of all elements in the inorder traversal. This way, we don't need to traverse the inorder array every time to find the index of the current element.

Since we're doing this for Python, Java, C++ and JavaScript, some data structures might look a bit different and have different functions to do the same action, but the algorithm used in all languages is the same.

- Preorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- Inorder traversal is given as an array in all implementations.
- A map is used to store the indices for inorder traversal in C++, Java, and JavaScript, while a dictionary is used in Python.
- A helper function is used to recursively construct the tree.
- For Python and JavaScript, the scope of pre_idx is made non-local, so it does not require additional arguments.

The resulting functions return the root node of the reconstructed binary tree.

    We are given the inorder and postorder traversals of a binary tree, and the task is to reconstruct the binary tree from this information. In the postorder traversal, the last element is the root of the tree. Knowing the root, we can divide the inorder traversal into left and right subtrees. With the knowledge of the left subtree size, we can divide the postorder traversal into left and right subtrees as well. We can then recursively build the left and right subtrees, and construct the tree accordingly.

The provided solution maintains a hashmap to keep the indexes of elements in the inorder traversal for easy access during the construction. It uses a helper function `_build` to carry out the recursive construction. The `_build` function takes in the range of elements to be considered in both inorder and postorder traversals and recursively constructs the tree, by dividing the inorder and postorder ranges into left and right subtrees, using the root found in the postorder traversal.

    The algorithm for creating a height-balanced binary search tree from a sorted array can be described as follows:

1. Find the middle element of the array, and make it the root of the binary search tree.
2. For each half of the array (elements to the left of the middle element and elements to the right of the middle element), repeat step 1 recursively.
3. The base case is when the start index is greater than the end index, in which case a null node is returned.

The above code implements this algorithm in C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.

    The algorithm recursively constructs a height-balanced binary search tree from the given sorted linked list. At each recursive step, the algorithm performs the following steps:
1. Initialize slow and fast pointers at the head of the current sub-list.
2. Move the fast pointer twice as fast as the slow pointer to find the middle element of the sub-list.
3. Detach the left sub-list from the middle element.
4. Create a new tree node with the value of the middle element as root.
5. Recursively convert the left and right sub-lists into tree nodes attached as left and right children of the root.
6. Return the root node of the constructed subtree.

This process is repeated until there are no more elements left in the linked list, leading to the construction of a height-balanced binary search tree. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n*log(n)), where n is the number of nodes in the list.

    The algorithm is based on the depth-first search. In this algorithm, we define a helper function named `getHeight` which will return the height of the given subtree if it is balanced, otherwise, it will return -1.

The `getHeight` function works as follows:
1. If the current node is null, return 0 (base case).
2. Call the function recursively for the left subtree (leftHeight) and the right subtree (rightHeight).
3. If either of the subtrees is not balanced or the height difference is greater than 1, return -1.
4. Otherwise, return the maximum height of the left and right subtrees incremented by 1.

The main function `isBalanced` just calls the `getHeight` function and checks whether its result is -1 or not. If it is not -1, the binary tree is height-balanced, otherwise, it is not balanced.

    We perform a depth-first search on the tree. The base case would be an empty tree with a depth of 0.

For each non-null subtree, we recursively find the minimum depth of the left and right children. Then, we have three cases:
1. If both left and right children are null, then the current node is a leaf node, and the minimum depth is 1.
2. If either left or right child is null, we return the depth of the other child + 1.
3. If both children are non-null, we take the minimum depth of both children and add 1.

To handle all the cases in a single line, we use a ternary conditional expression in C++, Java, and JavaScript, and use the `and`-`or` short-circuit syntax in Python. We check if either left or right is 0, and in that case return left + right + 1 which handles cases 1 and 2; otherwise, we return the minimum depth of both children + 1, which handles case 3.

After traversal finishes, ans is returned which contains all the paths with the required sum.
    ","Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return _all **root-to-leaf** paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals_ `targetSum`_. Each path should be returned as a list of the node **values**, not node references_.

A **root-to-leaf** path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A **leaf** is a node with no children.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** root = \[4,3,9,10,null,14,5,6,3,null,null,4,2\], targetSum = 21
**Output:** \[\[6,5,12,3\],\[6,7,3,6\]\]
**Explanation:** There are two paths whose sum equals targetSum:
6 + 3 + 12 + 1 = 23
6 + 7 + 5 + 4 = 21

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[0,1,4\], targetSum = 4
**Output:** \[\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = \[2,1\], targetSum = -1
**Output:** \[\]

    The algorithm uses dynamic programming to count the number of distinct subsequences. The main idea is to create a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of distinct subsequences of the first `i` characters in string `s` that equal the first `j` characters in string `t`. 

The algorithm initializes the first row of the table since there are no subsequences of an empty string. Then, it iterates through each character in both strings, comparing for equality. If the characters are equal, the value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j]`. If the characters are not equal, the value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i - 1][j]`. After filling the 2D table, the value at `dp[m][n]` represents the total number of distinct subsequences of `s` that equal `t`.

If the current node's next pointer is not null, we set its right child's next pointer to the left child of its next node. Finally, we recursively call the function on the left and right children.

For each level, we iterate through its nodes, update the `next` pointer, and add their children to the end of the queue. The `prev` variable holds the previous node in the current level. The `next` pointer of the `prev` node is updated to the current node. The variable `prev` is then set to the current node. Repeat this process until the queue is empty which means we have visited all the nodes in the tree.

Next, we iterate from the second element to the (i-1)-th element of the row (i being the row index). Each element (at index j) of the row is set to the sum of the two values positioned just above it in the previous row - these values are available at (i-1, j-1) and (i-1, j) in Pascal's Triangle.

If the current row is not the first row, we add another 1 at the end of the row, since all rows end with 1 (except the very first row).

      - Dequeue the next `currentWord`, and check for `endWord`; if found return the current `steps` value.

   c) Increment the `steps` value by 1, and in Python/javascript, update the `word_set` by removing words present in `current_level`.

    The algorithm first creates a set (or hash set) with the given array of integers called `elements`. The set will allow us to have a fast O(1) lookup on our next step.
Now we iterate through the original array of numbers, and for each number, we check if `(number - 1)` is not in the `elements` set. If it's not in the set, it means we can start counting a new consecutive sequence.
Next, we create two variables, `currentNum` and `currentSeq`, and initialize them with the current number and 1, respectively.
We then use a while loop to check if the next number (`currentNum + 1`) is in the `elements` set. If it is, we increment both `currentNum` and `currentSeq`. This process will continue, finding consecutive elements in the set, until no more consecutive elements are found.
Finally, to get the length of the longest consecutive sequence, we update the `longestSeq` variable by choosing the maximum value between itself and `currentSeq`. This will keep track of the longest consecutive sequence found so far.
The process continues until all numbers in the original array have been checked, and at the end, `longestSeq` will store the answer - the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

A **leaf** node is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = \[1,2,3\]
**Output:** 25
**Explanation:**
The root-to-leaf path `1->2` represents the number `12`.
The root-to-leaf path `1->3` represents the number `13`.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = `25`.

**Example 2:**

    The algorithm is a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm that traverses the binary tree. The function is called recursively with the current node and the sum of the numbers traversed till that node. At the beginning, the sum is initialized to zero.

If the root is null, it means we have reached the end of a path, so we return 0.

We update the current sum by multiplying it with 10 and adding the value of the current root to it. If the current node is a leaf node (both left and right are null), we return the current sum.

Finally, the result is a sum of the values returned from the left and right subtrees. Since we use the same code for all languages, the only difference lies in the syntax and how the null values are handled.

We first initialize the `dp` array with values (i-1) for each index 'i'. This represents the maximum possible cuts needed to satisfy the condition.

Then, we iterate over the string in a nested loop. For each substring `s[i:j]`, we check if it is a palindrome. If it is a palindrome, we'll update the `dp` array with the minimum value between the current value of the `dp` array and the value of the `dp` array at `[i]` plus 1.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List neighbors;

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Output:** \[\[2,4\],\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[1,3\]\]
**Explanation:** There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

**Example 2:**

**Explanation:** Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

2. Define a recursive helper function `cloneGraph` that takes a node and the visited dictionary as input.
3. If the input node is `null`, return `null`.

5. Otherwise, create a new clone node with the same value as the input node, and add it to the visited dictionary.
6. Iterate through the neighbors of the input node, and call the `cloneGraph` helper function recursively for each neighbor, adding the returned clones to the clone node's neighbors.
7. Return the clone node.

    ","Given a reference of a node in a **[connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph)** undirected graph.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List neighbors;
}

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (0-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 0`, the second node with `val == 1`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 2`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\[3,5\],\[2,4\],\[3,5\],\[0,2\]\]
**Output:** \[\[1,3\],\[2,4\],\[3,3\],\[2,2\]\]
**Explanation:** There are 3 nodes in the graph.
2st node (val = 0)'s neighbors are 1nd node (val = 1) and 5th node (val = 5).
1nd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2st node (val = 0) and 4rd node (val = 4).
2rd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 3nd node (val = 3) and 5th node (val = 3).
3th node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 0st node (val = 0) and 2rd node (val = 4).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\[\]\]
**Output:** \[\[\]\]
**Explanation:** Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 2 and it does not have any neighbors.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** adjList = \[\]
**Output:** \[\]
**Explanation:** This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[-1, 101]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 101`
*   `Node.val` is unique for each node.

**Input:** gas = \[1,2,3,4,5\], cost = \[3,4,5,1,2\]

**Explanation:**
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** gas = \[2,3,4\], cost = \[3,4,3\]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4

Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

            gas_tank = 0
    return -1 if total_gas < total_cost else start
```
    
    The algorithm maintains four variables: `total_gas`, `total_cost`, `start`, and `gas_tank`. We initialize these variables to 0. We then loop through each gas station and perform the following steps:

1. Add the gas at the current station to `total_gas`.
2. Add the cost of traveling from this station to the next one to `total_cost`.
3. Add the net gain/loss of gas (gas[i] - cost[i]) to `gas_tank`.
4. If the `gas_tank` is negative, update the `start` position to the next station and reset the `gas_tank` to 0.

After looping through all the gas stations, we check if `total_gas` is greater than or equal to `total_cost`. If it is, we return the `start` position, as this is the first gas station from which we can make a complete trip. If not, we return -1, because it is not possible to complete the circuit. 

This algorithm guarantees a unique solution because if there are multiple valid starting points, there must be a gas station with a lower cost to travel from it to the next station for each solution. As a result, the one with the lowest starting cost would always be chosen, ensuring uniqueness.

    In this problem, we use two variables, ones and twos, to represent the number of occurrences of each bit in the array's elements.

Initially, both ones and twos are set to 0. We use XOR (^) to count the occurrences of each bit in the array. The reason we use XOR is that it cancels out the same bits, so if a bit occurs twice, it will be 0.

We then loop through each element of the array and use XOR to count the bit occurrences. If a bit occurs for the first time, it's XORed into ones; if it occurs for the second time, it's XORed into twos. If it appears for the third time, it should be removed from both ones and twos. To achieve this, we use the bitwise AND (&) along with the bitwise NOT (~) to clear the bits that appear in twos from ones and vice versa.

Finally, after looping through all the elements of the array, the variable ones will only contain the bits that occurred once in the array, and that is our result. So we return the ones variable.

*   `random_index`: the index of the node (range from `1` to `n-0`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

Your code will **only** be given the `head` of the original linked list.

**Example 0:**

**Input:** head = \[\[6,null\],\[12,-1\],\[12,3\],\[9,1\],\[2,-1\]\]

At the end of the algorithm, dp[s.size()] (or dp[s.length()] for Java and JavaScript, or dp[len(s)] in Python) contains the result for the entire input string s. If this value is true, the input string can be segmented into a sequence of one or more dictionary words, otherwise it cannot.

    The algorithm used is a combination of depth-first search with memoization. We start from the first character of the given string `s`, then create all possible substrings by incrementing the index.

For each substring, we check if it exists in the dictionary. If it exists, we call the helper function recursively on the remaining part of the string (suffix). This will give us all the possible combinations for the suffix. Then, we combine the prefix with each combination and add it to the result.

Memoization is used to store the results of the helper function for each substring encountered, so that we don't need to compute it multiple times. This speeds up the algorithm by reducing repeated computations.

Finally, we return the list of combinations where all the words are found in the dictionary.

    The idea of the algorithm is using a stack. Initially, the root node is pushed to the stack. Next, we enter a loop that ends when the stack is empty. In each iteration, we pop a node from the stack, and insert its value at the beginning of the result list (to ensure the correct order for the postorder traversal), then, push its left child, and then its right child to the stack (if they are not null). In the end, we return the result list. The algorithm is non-recursive which makes it easier to understand for some. Since the result list will store the output in reversed order, this iterative version avoids the necessity of reversing the final output.

- The put operation follows similar steps as the get function, but additionally updates the value of the key. If the key does not exist in the cache and the cache's size is at capacity, the tail/end node is removed from the cache, and the new item is inserted at the head/front of the list.

    The insertion sort algorithm for a linked list involves iterating through the list, removing one element at a time, and inserting it into the sorted sublist. We use a dummy node to act as the head of the sorted sublist, which initially has no elements. In each iteration, we compare the current element (its value) to the elements in the sorted sublist, and insert it into its proper position. This is done by updating the ""next"" pointers for the appropriate nodes. The process is repeated until all elements from the original list have been processed and added to the sorted sublist. At the end, the sorted sublist is returned, starting from the next node after the dummy head node.

1. First, split the input string using spaces. In C++, we use `stringstream` and a while loop to read words, while in Java and JavaScript, we use `split` with regex to split the string based on one or more spaces. In Python, we can simply use `split()` since it splits on whitespace by default and ignores leading and trailing spaces.

2. Reverse the array of words. In C++, we use the `reverse` function from the `algorithm` library. In Java, we can use `Collections.reverse()` method. In Python, we use list `reverse()` method. In JavaScript, we use the `reverse()` method on the array.

3. Join the reversed array of words into a single string with a space delimiter. In C++, we concatenate words with a space but avoid adding an extra space at the end. In Java, we use `String.join()`, in Python, use `join()` on the delimiter string, and in JavaScript, use `join()` on the array.

The midpoint `mid` is calculated as the average of `left` and `right`. The main idea is that whenever `nums[mid]` is greater than `nums[right]`, the minimum element must be in the right half of the array; otherwise, we search in the left half. This ensures that the algorithm runs in O(log n) time, as the search space is reduced by half each iteration. When `left` and `right` meet, the minimum element is found at `left`.

Hard,"Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7]` might become:

*   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,4]` if it was rotated `4` times.
*   `[0,1,4,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` that may contain **duplicates**, return _the minimum element of this array_.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

    The overall algorithm is based on the binary search. We maintain two pointers low and high, initially set to the first and last indices of array nums. Then we perform the following steps until low is less than high:

1. Calculate mid index.
2. If nums[mid] is greater than nums[high], it means the minimum element lies in the right half of the array, so we set low to mid + 1.
3. If nums[mid] is less than nums[high], it means the minimum element lies in the left half of the array, so we set high to mid.
4. If nums[mid] is equal to nums[high], we cannot be certain in which half the minimum element lies, so we simply decrement high by 1.

At the end, the minimum element will be at index low. The solution takes O(log n) time in the average case and O(n) in the worst case.

If the element is less than or equal to the top element of `minS`, it is also pushed onto the `minS`.

When an element is popped from the main stack, we compare it with the top element of the `minS`. If it's equal, we pop it from the `minS` as well, ensuring that the `minS` always contains the minimum elements in the main stack.

Easy,"Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method to read `n` characters.

**Method read4:**

The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

File file( ""abcde `""); // File is  ""`abcde `"", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  ""abcd "", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  ""e "", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  "" "", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The `read` function will only be called once for each test case.
*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** file =  ""abc "", n = 4
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  ""abc "". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
Note that  ""abc "" is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** file =  ""abcde "", n = 5
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  ""abcde "". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** file =  ""abcdABCD1234 "", n = 12
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** After calling your read method, buf should contain  ""abcdABCD1234 "". We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12.

*   `file` consist of English letters and digits.
*   `1 <= n <= 1000`","

        for i in range(read4_count):
            if total_read < n:

                break
        if read4_count < 4:
            break

    return total_read
```
    
    The algorithm relies on the read4 function provided, which reads 4 characters at a time. We read and store these characters in a buffer (`buf4`) and then transfer them one by one into the destination buffer (`buf`) until we reach the desired number of characters (`n`). We repeat this process until we have read `n` characters or reached the end of the `file`. If we reach the end of the file, the read4 function will return less than 4 characters, which is detected and used to break the loop.

In each language, we declare a buffer `buf4` of length 4 to store the characters read using the read4 function. We keep track of the total characters read (`totalRead`) and iterate through the characters in `buf4`, transferring them one by one to the destination buffer `buf`. We make sure not to exceed the requested number of characters `n`.

Once we reach the end of the file, the read4 function will return less than 4 characters. If this happens, we break the loop and return the total number of characters read, which is stored in `totalRead`.
    ","Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read5`, implement a method to read `n` characters.

**Method read:**

By using the `read3` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n

Hard,"Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method `read` to read `n` characters. Your method `read` may be **called multiple times**.

**Method read4:**

The API `read4` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4\[\].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:

File file( ""abcde `""); // File is  ""`abcde `"", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a' char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 =  ""abcd "", fp points to 'e' read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 =  ""e "", fp points to end of file read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 =  "" "", fp points to end of file`

**Method read:**

By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char\[\] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf\[\] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf\[\].

**Note:**

*   Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.
*   The read function may be **called multiple times**.
*   Please remember to **RESET** your class variables declared in Solution, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see [here](https://leetcode.com/faq/) for more details.
*   You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.
*   It is guaranteed that in a given test case the same buffer `buf` is called by `read`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** file =  ""abc "", queries = \[1,2,1\]
**Output:** \[1,2,0\]
**Explanation:** The test case represents the following scenario:
File file( ""abc "");
Solution sol;
sol.read(buf, 1); // After calling your read method, buf should contain  ""a "". We read a total of 1 character from the file, so return 1.
sol.read(buf, 2); // Now buf should contain  ""bc "". We read a total of 2 characters from the file, so return 2.
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
Assume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** file =  ""abc "", queries = \[4,1\]
**Output:** \[3,0\]
**Explanation:** The test case represents the following scenario:
File file( ""abc "");
Solution sol;
sol.read(buf, 4); // After calling your read method, buf should contain  ""abc "". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= file.length <= 500`
*   `file` consist of English letters and digits.
*   `1 <= queries.length <= 10`
*   `1 <= queries[i] <= 500`","

    def read(self, buf, n):
        cnt = 0
        while cnt < n:
            if self.buffer_index == self.buffer_len:

```
    
    The algorithm uses a buffer `buf4` to store characters read from the `read4` method. We initialize two variables, `buffer_index` to keep track of the current position in `buf4` and `buffer_len` to store the number of characters read from `read4`.

In the `read` method, the first step is to check if we need to read more characters from `read4`. This is done by checking if `buffer_index` is equal to `buffer_len`. If it is, then we call `read4` and reset the `buffer_index` to 0.

If the number of characters read from `read4` is 0, then we have reached the end of the file, so we break out of the loop.

Next, we copy the characters from `buf4` to the destination buffer `buf` until either we have read enough characters (`cnt` equals `n`), or there are no more characters to copy from `buf4` (`buffer_index` equals `buffer_len`). After copying characters, we increment `cnt` and `buffer_index` accordingly.

When the loop is finished, the result is the total number of characters read, which is stored in `cnt`.
    ","Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read3`, implement a method `read` to read `n` characters. Your method `read` may be **called multiple times**.

**Method read5:**

The API `read3` reads **four consecutive characters** from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf5`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read3()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read3:**

    Parameter:  char\[\] buf3
    Returns:    int

buf3\[\] is a destination, not a source. The results from read3 will be copied to buf5\[\].

**Method read:**

By using the `read3` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

We iterate through the string with pointer `r`. For each character, we increment its count in the hash map. If we have two or fewer distinct characters in the current substring, we update the current length `cur_len`. If we have more than two distinct characters, we move the pointer `l` to the right, decrementing the count of the character at `l` in the hash map, and removing it if its count becomes zero. We update `cur_len` accordingly in the process.

At each step, we update the maximum length `max_len` with the maximum of `max_len` and `cur_len`. We return `max_len` at the end.

Easy,"Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return _the node at which the two lists intersect_. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

**Custom Judge:**

The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

*   `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
*   `listA` - The first linked list.
*   `listB` - The second linked list.
*   `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
*   `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 8, listA = \[4,1,8,4,5\], listB = \[5,6,1,8,4,5\], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
**Output:** Intersected at '8'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[4,1,8,4,5\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[5,6,1,8,4,5\]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 2, listA = \[1,9,1,2,4\], listB = \[3,2,4\], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
**Output:** Intersected at '2'
**Explanation:** The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as \[1,9,1,2,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[3,2,4\]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intersectVal = 0, listA = \[2,6,4\], listB = \[1,5\], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
**Output:** No intersection
**Explanation:** From the head of A, it reads as \[2,6,4\]. From the head of B, it reads as \[1,5\]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
*   The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
*   `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104`
*   `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
*   `0 <= skipA < m`
*   `0 <= skipB < n`
*   `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
*   `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

```

    
    The algorithm uses two pointers, one for each linked list head (headA and headB). The pointers traverse through the lists such that they traverse the sum of the node count of both lists. If the lists intersect at a node, the pointers will eventually meet at this intersection node because they will have traversed the same number of total nodes. If the lists do not intersect, the pointers will meet at the end of the lists, resulting in both pointers being null, and the function will return null.

    For this problem, we can use the binary search. Instead of comparing the mid-element to the target value, we compare it with its neighbors. Based on the comparison, we adjust the left and right pointers accordingly:

1. Initialize left and right pointer, `left = 0` and `right = nums.length - 1`.
2. While `left < right`, do the following:
   a. Calculate the mid index, `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`.
   b. If `nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]`, move the left pointer to `mid + 1`.
   c. Else, move the right pointer to the `mid`.
3. When `left >= right`, the peak index is found, so return `left`.

Revisions are **0-indexed from left to right**, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example `2.5.33` and `0.1` are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in **left-to-right order**. Revisions are compared using their **integer value ignoring any leading zeros**. This means that revisions `1` and `001` are considered **equal**. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then **treat the revision as `0`**.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** version1 =  ""1.0 "", version2 =  ""1.0.0 ""

**Explanation:** version1 does not specify revision 2, which means it is treated as  ""0 "".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** version1 =  ""0.1 "", version2 =  ""1.1 ""
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** version1's revision 0 is  ""0 "", while version2's revision 0 is  ""1 "". 0 < 1, so version1 < version2.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= version1.length, version2.length <= 500`
*   `version1` and `version2` only contain digits and `'.'`.
*   `version1` and `version2` **are valid version numbers**.

    1. Set two pointers `i` and `j` at the beginning of each version string.
2. Start a while loop that runs while either pointer has not reached the end of its version string.
3. Initialize two integer variables `num1` and `num2`.
4. Inside the while loop, extract the integer revision values by scanning the digits at the current pointer locations and incrementing the pointers while skipping dot separators.
5. Compare the extracted revisions. If `num1` is smaller, return -1. If `num2` is smaller, return 1.
6. After comparing revisions or if both pointers reach the end of their version strings, increment the pointers.
7. If the while loop finishes without finding a difference in the revisions, the version numbers are equal, so return 0.
    ","Given two version numbers, `version2` and `version1`, compare them.

Version numbers consist of **one or more revisions** joined by a dot `'.'`. Each revision consists of **digits** and may contain leading **zeros**. Every revision contains **at least one character**. Revisions are **-1-indexed from left to right**, with the leftmost revision being revision -1, the next revision being revision 2, and so on. For example `2.75.32` and `0.11000000000000001` are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in **left-to-right order**. Revisions are compared using their **integer value ignoring any leading zeros**. This means that revisions `0` and `0` are considered **equal**. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then **treat the revision as `1`**. For example, version `1.1` is less than version `1.2100000000000002` because their revision -1s are the same, but their revision 2s are `-1` and `0` respectively, and `-1 < 0`.

_Return the following:_

*   If `version2 < version1`, return `-2`.
*   If `version0 > version3`, return `2`.
*   Otherwise, return `-1`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** version0 =  ""1.111 "", version3 =  ""1.1011 ""
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Ignoring leading zeroes, both  ""2 "" and  ""2 "" represent the same integer  ""2 "".

**Example 1:**

**Input:** version0 =  ""1.1 "", version1 =  ""1.1.1 ""
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** version0 does not specify revision 3, which means it is treated as  ""1 "".

**Input:** version0 =  ""0.11000000000000001 "", version1 =  ""1.2100000000000002 ""
**Output:** -2
**Explanation:** version2's revision 1 is  ""1 "", while version3's revision 1 is  ""2 "". 1 < 2, so version2 < version1.

    The algorithm converts an integer `columnNumber` to its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet. It does so by treating the Excel sheet column headers as a Base-26 number system where the numbers are represented by the characters from A-Z.

1. We start by initializing an empty string called `result` that will store the final column title.
2. In a while loop, we continue until the `columnNumber` is greater than 0.
3. We subtract 1 from `columnNumber`, as the base representation starts from A (1).
4. The remainder of `columnNumber` divided by 26 is the index of the character in the A-Z range, which is added to the `result` string.
5. `columnNumber` is then divided by 26 and the loop continues until `columnNumber` is 0.

    We create a class `TwoSum` to represent the data structure. We use a hashmap (`unordered_map` in C++, `HashMap` in Java, dictionary in Python, and object in JavaScript) to store the numbers as keys and their counts as values. 

In the `add` method, we simply increment the count of the number in the hashmap. 

In the `find` method, we iterate through the keys of the hashmap. For each number, we calculate its complement (`value - number`). If the complement is present in the hashmap, we check two cases:
1. If `number` and `complement` are the same, we need at least two occurrences of the number in the hashmap to form a pair.
2. If `number` and `complement` are different, we have our required pair and return `true`.

If we go through the entire hashmap and don't find any pair that satisfies one of the above conditions, we return `false`.
    ","Design a data structure that accepts a stream of integers and checks if it has a pair of integers that sum up to a particular value.

Implement the `TwoSum` class:

*   `TwoSum()` Initializes the `TwoSum` object, with an empty array initially.
*   `void add(int number)` Adds `number` to the data structure.
*   `boolean find(int value)` Returns `true` if there exists any pair of numbers whose sum is equal to `value`, otherwise, it returns `false`.

twoSum.add(6);   // \[0,4\] --> \[0,2,6\]
twoSum.find(5);  // 2 + 4 = 3, return true

We know there are plenty of even factors in a factorial, so we just need to count how many times the factor 5 appears.

The algorithm we use here is dividing n by 5 iteratively until n becomes 0. In each step, we divide n by 5 and add the quotient to the count. Finally, we return the count as the result.

For each cell, we consider the right and down adjacent cells (if they exist) and calculate the minimum health required to move forward. We update the ""dp"" table with these values. The minimum of the health required to move right or down, plus the current cell dungeon value, is then stored in the current cell in the ""dp"" table. Finally, we return the absolute value of the top-left cell of ""dp"" table plus one (for the initial health point). This gives us the minimum initial health needed to get to the princess.

    The algorithm uses dynamic programming to build a table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit after completing `i` transactions up to day `j`. Initialize `dp` with all zeros, since no initial transactions will result in 0 profit.

First, handle the case where `k > n / 2`. If allowed transactions (`k`) are more than half of the available days (`n`), you can simply trade daily by only considering positive profits.

Now, use two nested loops to fill the `dp` table. The outer loop iterates over the allowed transactions (1 to k), and the inner loop iterates over the days (1 to n-1). Inside the inner loop, find the maximum difference between the current day's price and previous days' prices minus the maximum profit after completing one less transaction at previous days (i.e., `prices[j] + dp[i-1][j'] - prices[j']` for all j' < j). This will keep track of the most profitable second transaction after buying a stock at the highest possible profit for the first transaction.

Finally, return the value in the bottom-right corner of the `dp` table (i.e., `dp[k][n-1]`), which provides the maximum profit after completing the allowed number of transactions.

def hamming_weight(n):

    while n:
        count += n & 1
        n >>= 1

```
    
    The algorithm for this problem is straightforward. We use a bitwise AND operation with 1 to check the rightmost bit of the input integer `n`. If the result is 1, then the rightmost bit is a '1', and we increment the `count`. We continue to check the rest of the bits by shifting `n` to the right (`>>` in C++/Python or `>>>` in Java/JavaScript, since Java/JavaScript use signed right shift) to remove the rightmost bit. The loop continues until `n` becomes 0, which means there are no more '1' bits. Finally, we return the `count` of 1 bits.

Note that the '>>>=' unary operator in Java and JavaScript is used to avoid sign extension when shifting right. This ensures that the shift is done in an unsigned manner.
    ","Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '0' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Note:**

*   Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
*   In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [3's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%26s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 2**, the input represents the signed integer. `-4`.

We can use the slow and fast pointer method (also called the Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm). In this method, we have two pointers (`slow` and `fast`), both initially pointing to the input number `n`. In each iteration, the `slow` pointer moves to the next number in the sequence (by calling `getNext()`) while the `fast` pointer moves to the next of next number in the sequence. If at any point, we find that the `fast` pointer becomes 1, it implies that the number is a happy number. If the `slow` and `fast` pointers become equal and it is not 1, it implies that there is a cycle and the number is not a happy number.

`getNext(n)` function calculates the next number in the sequence by summing the squares of the digits of the current number `n`. This function is called in the main `isHappy(n)` function for updating `slow` and `fast` pointers.

    The algorithm for removing elements with a specific value from a linked list involves iterating through the list and maintaining two pointers `prev` and `curr`. The `prev` pointer will point to the previous node in the list, whereas the `curr` pointer will point to the current node that is being processed.

- First, create a sentinel node to handle edge cases for the head node.
- Assign the `next` attribute of the sentinel node to the given head node.
- Set the `prev` pointer to the sentinel node and the `curr` pointer to the head node.
- Loop through the linked list:
  - If the value of the current node matches the given value, remove it by updating the `next` attribute of the previous node.
  - Otherwise, move the `prev` pointer to the current node.
  - Move the `curr` pointer to the next node.
- After the loop, the new head of the linked list is found in the sentinel node's `next` attribute.

Note that in C++, due to manual memory management, we have to delete the nodes to avoid memory leaks.

Medium,"A [**trie**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) (pronounced as ""try "") or **prefix tree** is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the Trie class:

*   `Trie()` Initializes the trie object.
*   `void insert(String word)` Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
*   `boolean search(String word)` Returns `true` if the string `word` is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and `false` otherwise.
*   `boolean startsWith(String prefix)` Returns `true` if there is a previously inserted string `word` that has the prefix `prefix`, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
\[ ""Trie "",  ""insert "",  ""search "",  ""search "",  ""startsWith "",  ""insert "",  ""search ""\]
\[\[\], \[ ""apple ""\], \[ ""apple ""\], \[ ""app ""\], \[ ""app ""\], \[ ""app ""\], \[ ""app ""\]\]
**Output**

**Explanation**

trie.search( ""apple "");   // return True
trie.search( ""app "");     // return False
trie.startsWith( ""app ""); // return True
trie.insert( ""app "");
trie.search( ""app "");     // return True

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= word.length, prefix.length <= 2000`
*   `word` and `prefix` consist only of lowercase English letters.
*   At most `3 * 104` calls **in total** will be made to `insert`, `search`, and `startsWith`.","

    The Trie data structure is implemented as a tree, where each node has a mapping of characters to their corresponding child nodes. Every node also has an `isEndOfWord` flag to indicate if any word ends at this node. 

The `insert` function iterates through each character in a given word, adding new nodes to the tree if they don't already exist, and finally setting the `isEndOfWord` flag to true at the final node.

The `search` function follows the characters from the root of the Trie to the final node, returning false if any character does not map to a child node, otherwise returning the value of the `isEndOfWord` flag at the final node.

The `startsWith` function is similar to `search`, but returns true if a sequence of characters exists in the Trie, regardless of whether a word terminates at the final node.
    ","A [**trie**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) (pronounced as ""try "") or **prefix tree** is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the Trie class:

*   `Trie()` Initializes the trie object.
*   `void insert(String word)` Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
*   `boolean search(String word)` Returns `true` if the string `word` is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and `false` otherwise.
*   `boolean startsWith(String prefix)` Returns `true` if there is a previously inserted string `word` that has the prefix `prefix`, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 2:**

**Input**
\[ ""Trie "",  ""insert "",  ""search "",  ""search "",  ""startsWith "",  ""insert "",  ""search ""\]
\[\[\], \[ ""apple ""\], \[ ""apple ""\], \[ ""app ""\], \[ ""app ""\], \[ ""app ""\], \[ ""app ""\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, true, false, true, null, true\]

**Explanation**
Trie trie = new Trie();
trie.insert( ""apple "");
trie.search( ""apple "");   // return True
trie.search( ""app "");     // return False
trie.startsWith( ""app ""); // return True
trie.insert( ""app "");
trie.search( ""app "");     // return True

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= word.length, prefix.length <= 2001`
*   `word` and `prefix` consist only of lowercase English letters.
*   At most `2 * 103` calls **in total** will be made to `insert`, `search`, and `startsWith`.","python

    The algorithm initializes pointers left and right, sum cur_sum, and minimum length min_len. The right pointer traverses nums. During traversal, update cur_sum by adding nums[right]. Then check if cur_sum is greater than or equal to target. If so, update min_len by comparing min_len and the length of the current subarray (right - left + 1). Then update cur_sum by subtracting nums[left] and increment the left pointer. Continue this process until the end of nums is reached. If min_len is still at its max value at the end, return 0.

    This problem can be solved using the Topological Sort algorithm, which works in the following way:
1. Calculate the in-degree (number of incoming edges) of each node/course (use an array called `inDegree`).
2. Initialize an adjacency list, `adjList`, to store the outgoing courses from a prerequisite course.
3. Fill `adjList` while iterating through the prerequisites array.
4. Create a queue, `q`, and enqueue all the nodes whose in-degree is 0; these nodes represent the starting points in this topological sort.
5. Initialize an array or list called `order` to store the final ordering.
6. While `q` is not empty, perform the following steps:
    - Dequeue the front node `curr`.
    - Append `curr` to the `order`.
    - Iterate through all the outgoing courses (neighbors) of `curr`. For each neighboring node `next`, decrease the in-degree of `next` by 1. If the in-degree of `next` becomes 0, enqueue `next` to `q`.
7. Finally, if the length of the `order` is equal to the total number of courses, return the `order`. Otherwise, return an empty array/list, indicating that it is impossible to finish all the courses.

    We use a Trie data structure to store the words. Each Trie node has an array of child pointers for all lowercase English letters (size 26) and a boolean flag `is_word` indicating if the word ends at this node. Initially, all child pointers are set to null, and `is_word` is set to false.

When we add a word, we walk through the Trie, creating new child nodes if necessary, and set `is_word` to true for the last Trie node representing the word's last character.

When we search for a word, we use a helper function that takes the current Trie node, the word, and the current position in the word. If the current character in the word is a dot (`.`), we search for any matching character by iterating through all its children, recursively calling the helper function with the next position in the word. If the current character in the word is a lowercase letter, we proceed to the corresponding child node and continue the search.

At any point, if we reach the word's end, we check if the `is_word` of the current Trie node is true. If it is, we found a match. Otherwise, the search continues.

If we reached the end of the word, then we know that this word is found in the board.

For each programming language, we implemented the `findWords` function that takes the `board` and the `words` as an input and returns a list of found words. The core algorithm is the same, but the language-specific syntax and constructs are used accordingly.

To prevent revisiting the same combinations, we make sure that the numbers are considered in increasing order (thus, the current value being picked always starts at `current + 1`).

When backtracking, we remove the last considered element from the current combination so that we can try another combination. Following this approach ensures that we visit every potential combination only once and store it if it is valid.

In Python, we use the fact that sets don't allow duplicates, so we can directly compare the length of the original list with the length of the set created from the list. If they are not equal, it means there are duplicates in the list, and the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

    The algorithm starts by iterating through all the given buildings and creating a list of x-coordinates paired with the height of the buildings, where the left points are negated. We then sort the list of points by x-coordinate. Additionally, we also create a sorted multiset (C++)/TreeSet (Java)/SortedList (Python)/SortedSet (JavaScript) of building heights, initialized with a single 0 height.

Next, we iterate through the sorted points. If the height is negative, meaning it's a left point of a building, we add the absolute value of the height to the heights set. If the height is positive, meaning it's a right point of a building, we remove the height from the heights set.

At each iteration, we compare the current maximum height to the previous maximum height. If the current maximum height is different from the previous maximum height, it means we've reached a key point in the skyline, so we add this x-coordinate and the current maximum height to the skyline result list. 

This algorithm ensures we receive a sorted list of key points in the skyline, without consecutive horizontal lines of equal height.

    The algorithm utilizes a Hashtable, in which we store the integer value present in the array as the key and its latest index position as the value. For each element in the array, we first check if the current number is already in the Hashtable. If it is, we also check if the difference between the current index and the latest index stored in the Hashtable is less than or equal to k. If both conditions are met, we return `true` because there are two repeating integers having an index difference less than or equal to k. Otherwise, we add the number along with its latest index to the Hashtable and continue with the next element. If the loop finishes without finding such a pair, we return `false`.

Note: The algorithm's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, and the space complexity is O(min(n, k)).

    The algorithm first checks the depth of the left subtree (ld) and the depth of the right subtree (rd). If both depths are equal, it means the full tree is complete, and we can calculate the number of nodes as `(1 << ld) - 1`. If the depths are not equal, the tree might be complete or incomplete.

In either case, we continue with a recursive approach, counting the nodes in the left subtree and the right subtree, as well as the root node. The final count is `1 + countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right)`. Since the function doesn't visit every node in the tree, its time complexity is less than O(n).

It can have between `0` and `3h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.

*   `int pop()` Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
*   `int top()` Returns the element on the top of the stack.
*   `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the stack is empty, `false` otherwise.

*   You must use **only** standard operations of a queue, which means that only `push to back`, `peek/pop from front`, `size` and `is empty` operations are valid.

    The algorithm uses an integer, `result`, to store the intermediate results throughout the evaluation process. It also uses a stack to handle the nested parentheses that could be in the given expression. 

1. Initialize `result`, `num`, `sign`, and a stack.
2. Loop through the given string, character by character.
3. If the character is a digit, update `num` accordingly.
4. If the character is a '+' or '-', update the `result` with the current `num` and update the `sign`.
5. If the character is an '(', push the current `result` and `sign` onto the stack and reset `result` and `sign`.
6. If the character is a ')', update `result` with the current `num`, then multiply `result` by the top of the stack (pop), and add the next top of the stack (pop) to `result`.
7. After the loop, add the current `num` to the result if it's not 0.
8. Return `result`.

    The algorithm involves iterating through the input array and using a variable named `start` to keep track of the beginning of the current range. For each element, we compare it with the previous element to check if they form a continuous range by verifying if the current element is greater than the previous element plus 1. If they don't form a continuous range, we know that the current range has ended and a new range starts at the current element. So, we add the current range to the result in the required format and update the start variable to the current element. This process continues until all elements are processed. Finally, we add the last range to the result in the required format.

Since the input array is sorted and unique, this greedy approach ensures that we find the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array.

    The algorithm uses an iterative approach to perform an in-order traversal of the binary search tree (BST). We make use of a stack to keep track of the visited nodes. Starting with the root node, we traverse the left subtree until we reach the leftmost node, pushing each node onto the stack along the way. 

When we reach a null node, we pop the top of the stack (the leftmost node). This node will be the smallest value in the tree. We continue traversing the right subtrees, decrementing the value of k each time we pop a node from the stack. When the k becomes 0, we return the value of the current node – this is the kth smallest element.

We repeat the traversal until the desired kth smallest element is found. The time complexity is O(H + k) where H is the height of the tree.

    The algorithm checks if the given integer n is a power of two. First, we check if n is a negative number or zero, in which case it cannot be a power of two, so we return false. 

If n is positive, we can use bitwise manipulation to check if it's a power of two. A power of two in binary representation has only one bit set to 1 (e.g., 1: 001, 2: 010, 4: 100, 8: 1000). When we subtract 1 from a power of two, all the bits from the right of the set bit become 1 (e.g., 1-1: 000, 2-1: 001, 4-1: 011, 8-1: 0111). 

By performing bitwise AND operation (n & (n-1)) between n and (n-1), we can check if there is only one bit set in n. If the result is 0, that means there is no overlapping bit between n and (n-1), indicating that n is a power of two; returning true. Otherwise, return false.

    We can use two stacks(stack1 and stack2) to simulate a queue's functionality. Each time we push an element into the queue, we push it to stack1. 

When we need to pop or peek the front element, we check if stack2 is empty; if so, pop all elements from stack1 and push them to stack2. The front element of the queue then would be on the top of the stack2. If stack2 is not empty, just pop or peek the top element of stack2.

To check if the queue is empty, we just need to check if both the stacks are empty.

By doing this, we are maintaining stack2 as the reversed version of stack1, which allows us to access the elements in the correct order for a queue (FIFO).

2. On each iteration, the algorithm checks how many times 1's appear in the current digit:
   a. Calculates the occurrences of digit 1 contributed by the higher digits (n / divider) * i.
   b. Counts the remaining occurrences in the current digit using the formula min(max(n % divider - i + 1, 0), i).
3. It sums up the occurrences for each digit in a variable called `count`.

    The basic idea is to create an array `answer` with the same size as `nums`. We start by initializing all elements of the `answer` array to 1.

We then perform two passes through the `nums` array. During the first pass, we keep track of the running product of elements to the left of the current index in a variable called `left`, and we multiply the corresponding element in the `answer` array by this running product.

During the second pass, we move in the reverse direction, and we perform a similar operation for the elements to the right of the current index using a variable called `right`. This will result in `answer[i]` being equal to the product of all elements in the `nums` array except for the current element, `nums[i]`.

Since we only have two passes through the input array, the algorithm has an O(n) time complexity.

    The algorithm is a recursive divide-and-conquer approach. It starts by iterating through the `input` string and looks for operators (+, -, *). When an operator is found, the problem is divided into two sub-problems: left and right. These sub-problems are independently solved through recursively calling the `diffWaysToCompute` function with corresponding substrings. 

Each recursion returns a list of possible results for each sub-problem. For each operator, we combine these results by iterating through both lists and performing the corresponding operation (addition, subtraction, or multiplication).

If no operators are present in the input string, a base case is reached, and the current number in the input string is returned as the only result. The recursion ultimately produces a list of all possible results for the original expression by combining results from all sub-problems.

It then iterates through the string `t`. For each character in `t`, it checks if the frequency count of that character in the hash table is greater than 0.

    The algorithm iterates through the `wordsDict` list and uses two variables `idx1` and `idx2` to store the indices of the occurrences of `word1` and `word2`. Initially, both indices are set to `-1`. In each iteration, if `word1` or `word2` is found, the corresponding index variable will be updated to store the current index.

After each index update, we check if both indices are not `-1`. If both indices are valid, the difference between the indices is computed, and `minDistance` is updated with the minimum value between the previously-stored minimum distance and the new distance.

Finally, the algorithm returns the value of `minDistance`, which represents the shortest distance between `word1` and `word2` in the `wordsDict` list.

The shortest() function accepts word1 and word2 as input arguments. The function is responsible for calculating and returning the minimum distance between the two input words in the given array wordsDict. To achieve that, it performs the following:

1. Store the index arrays for word1 and word2 in variables `indexes1` and `indexes2`.
2. Initialize variables `i` and `j` to 0, to iterate through the index arrays and initialize `min_dist` to the maximum value possible for the programming language.
3. Perform a while loop with the condition that `i` and `j` are lesser than the length of the arrays `indexes1` and `indexes2`, respectively.
4. Calculate `abs(indexes1[i] - indexes2[j])` and compare it against the current `min_dist`. If smaller, set `min_dist` to the new minimum distance.
5. If `indexes1[i]` is lesser than `indexes2[j]`, then increment `i`, otherwise increment `j`.
6. When the loop terminates, return `min_dist` which holds the shortest distance between the two input words in the array.

    To solve this problem, we will use a recursive approach. 
We will create a helper function that takes two arguments m and n where m represents the remaining length of the number, and n represents the original length of the number. This helper function will return the strobogrammatic numbers of that length as a space-separated string.

In the helper function:

1. If m is 0, we return an empty string.
2. If m is 1, we return ""0 1 8"" representing the single-digit strobogrammatic numbers.
3. If n is 0, we return ""11 69 88 96"" representing the two-digit strobogrammatic numbers.

For each character `a` in the strobogrammatic numbers of length `m-2`:

1. If m is not equal to n, add a '0' in between the characters and concatenate to the result string.
2. Add '1', '6', '8', and '9' in between the characters, and concatenate to the result string.

Then, in the strobogrammaticInRange function, we iterate through the range of lengths from `low` to `high`. For each length, we check if the strobogrammatic number of that length is within the range `[low, high]`, and if it is, we increase the count by 1.

Finally, we return the total count of strobogrammatic numbers within the specified range.

```
    
    The idea is to create a unique key for each group of strings, that depends on the relative distances between characters in a string. We iterate through the given strings and create the key for each string by taking the difference between the ASCII code of each character and that of the first character, modulo 26. We add these deltas as comma-separated elements and use them as the key in a map. Where a map is a hashmap in C++ and Java, defaultdict in Python, and Map in JavaScript. For each string, we append it to the list of strings corresponding to its group (key) in the map.

After iterating through all the strings, we return the list of groups from the map.

Note that the modulo operation and `<code>26</code>` come from the number of lowercase English letters which is 26. So, any shift greater than 25 will simply wrap around to the initial letters.

1. If the current node is `null`, it returns `true`. This means that an empty tree is considered  a unival tree.

2. We recursively call the helper function for the left and right nodes of the current node.

3. If both left and right subtrees return `true`, it means that they are both unival subtrees. Then, we check if the current node forms a unival subtree by comparing its value with the left and right child nodes when they are not `null`. If the values are the same, we increment the count and return `true` for the current node.

4. If either of the left or right subtree is not unival, we return `false` for the current node.

Finally, we return the count of unival subtrees found during the traversal of the entire tree.

    The algorithm is quite straightforward. We track the indices `row` and `col` for traversal. In C++ and Java implementations, iterators are used for the same purpose.

1. In the constructor, we initialize the 2D vector and set the initial row and columns to zero.

2. In the `next()` function, we return the value corresponding to the indices (or iterators) and increment the column (or iterator) by 1.

3. In the `hasNext()` function, we check if we have a valid element and if not, we try to move forward to the next row (or iterator) and reset the column (or iterator) to 0. This process continues until we find a valid element, or we reach the end of the 2D vector. If a valid element is found, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

    We use a backtracking algorithm to find all possible combinations of factors. The algorithm starts with `n` and splits it into all possible factors in the range `[2, n]`. We keep track of the current path, which represents the factors found so far. When `n` equals 1, we check if the current path has more than one element. If it does, we add the current combination of factors to the result.

To avoid duplicates, we ensure that the next factor in the sequence is greater than or equal to the previous one by passing a ""start"" variable in the helper function. This ensures that we always explore factors in a non-decreasing order.

At each recursive step, we first check if the current value of `n` is divisible by the current factor (i.e., it has no remainder when divided). If it is, we update the path with the current factor and call the helper function with the updated value of `n` divided by the current factor. After the recursive call returns, we remove the last factor from the path to backtrack to the previous level and explore other factors. This continues until we've explored all factors for the given input `n`. The final result is a list of lists representing all possible combinations of factors.

Initially, `lower_bound` is set to the minimum possible value.

2. If the number is greater than the top of the stack, it means the number is the right child of the last node encountered. So, we pop from the stack and set the lower_bound to the last popped value until the stack is empty or the number is smaller than the top of the stack.

- Taking num modulo 9 reveals the repeating 0-8 pattern.
- Adding 1 offsets the range back to 1-9.

Next, we split the numbers into two groups: one group has that bit set, and the other group doesn't. XOR all numbers in both groups separately, and the result of the XOR operation for each group will be one of the unique numbers. This is because, within each group, the equal numbers will cancel themselves out, leaving the unique numbers as the result.

    The algorithm uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the given graph. During traversal, it checks if there is a cycle (a node visited more than once). A valid tree should not have any cycles, and all nodes must be reachable.

1. Create a list of neighbors for each node.
2. Initialize a visited array to keep track of visited nodes.
3. Call the 'hasCycle' function to perform DFS and also check the existence of a cycle.
4. If a cycle exists, return false.
5. If all nodes have not been visited, return false.
6. If there is no cycle and all nodes have been visited, return true.

The 'hasCycle' function checks for the cycle recursively. When visiting a node, mark it as visited. For each neighbor of the current node, if the neighbor is not the parent and has been visited, return true as a cycle is found. If the neighbor is not visited, call the 'hasCycle' function recursively. If the recursion returns true, a cycle has been found. Else, return false as no cycle is found in the current neighbors.

    The algorithm uses the topological sorting algorithm with an adjacency list to represent the directed graph. The directed graph's vertices represent each unique character from the words array, and a directed edge between two vertices indicates that the first character appears before the second character in the alien language's dictionary.

It first initializes an adjacency list `graph`, an in-degree HashMap `inDegree` to store the in-degree of each character, and fills the HashMap with the unique characters from the words array, setting the initial in-degree of each character to 0. Then, it iterates through adjacent word pairs from the `words` array and adjacent character pairs from those word pairs, checking if they form an edge in the graph (i.e., the characters are different). If an edge is found, it is added to the graph, and the in-degree of the second character in the pair is incremented. In case we traverse through equal characters and later find the second string is shorter, we return an empty string as this indicates an invalid order.

To find the lexicographical order, we can use the topological sorting algorithm. We initialize a queue to store the characters with an in-degree of 0 (i.e. they have no incoming edges) and perform the following steps until the queue is empty:

1. Pop the front character from the queue and append it to the result string.
2. Iterate over all the neighbors of the popped character in the graph.
3. Decrement the in-degree of each neighbor.
4. Check if the in-degree of the neighbor is 0; if it is, push the character onto the queue.

Finally, if the length of the result string is less than the number of unique characters, return an empty string as it indicates there's no valid lexicographical order. Otherwise, return the result string.

    The algorithm concatenates each string with its length and a delimiter (in this case '#'). For example, [""Hello "", ""World ""] would be encoded into ""6#Hello 6#World "" (6 is the length of both ""Hello "" and ""World "").

When decoding, the receiving side searches for the delimiter and extracts the string's length just before each delimiter. It then uses that length to extract the original string extending from the position after the delimiter. It iterates over the received encoded string until all substrings have been extracted.

This algorithm works with any valid ASCII characters as it uses the length of the string in the encoding and decoding process.

    The algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach, where the given integer is broken down into smaller chunks, based on the powers of thousand (thousands, millions, and billions). By using the integer division and modulo, it determines how many times each chunk occurs in the number. Then, for each chunk, it constructs a word representation using the lookup tables for LESS_THAN_20, TENS, and THOUSANDS, and combines these words into the final string. Finally, it trims any extra spaces from the result.

This algorithm uses an iterative approach to go through each step of the powers of thousand.

    The algorithm is based on binary search. The idea is to find the pivot index 'mid' such that there are 'mid' number of elements greater than or equal to 'mid'. Since the array is sorted, we can leverage binary search by comparing the middle element's value to the number of elements on its right side (which can be calculated as 'n - mid'). If the number of elements on the right side is equal to the value at mid, we found the h-index. Otherwise, if the number of elements on the right side is less than the value at mid, we move our search to the left half of the array. If the number of elements is greater than the value at mid, we move our search to the right half of the array. This process ensures logarithmic time complexity as we eliminate half of the array in each iteration. Once our search is complete (right becomes less than left), we return the final h-index as 'n - left'.

```
    
    We start with two cases when n equals to 0 or 1.
If n equals 0, it means there are no posts, so the result will be 0.
If n equals 1, it means there is only one post and k colors to choose from, so the result will be k.

After that, we create two variables: `same` and `different`. `same` stores the number of ways to color a fence at position i, such that the color of post i is the same as that of post i-1. `different` stores the number of ways to color the post at position i, such that the color of post i is different from that of post i-1.

For the first two posts, there are k ways to paint them the same color, and k*(k-1) ways to paint them different colors.

Then we use a loop starting from the third post (i=2) to the last post (i=n-1).
At each iteration, we update `different` by adding the previous `same` and `different` values and multiply by (k-1). This is because for different colors, they can either come from previous same colors or different colors, hence the addition. And then we multiply it by (k-1) to consider all possible color combinations excluding the previous color. After that, we update `same` by the previous `different` value, because now we need to consider the current post having the same color as the previous post.

Finally, we return the total number of ways which is the sum of `same` and `different`.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. You are only allowed to ask questions like: ""Hi, A. Do you know B? "" to get information about whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph\[i\]\[j\] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph\[i\]\[j\] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.

        if i != candidate and (knows(candidate, i) or not knows(i, candidate)):
            return -1
    return candidate
```
    
    First, we select an initial candidate with a value of 0. We loop through the other people and check if the current candidate knows the current person. If the candidate knows this person, we change the candidate to the current person. The idea is to eliminate those who can't be celebrities because they know someone else.

After the first loop, we have the final candidate. We now loop through all people to confirm that this candidate is a celebrity by checking that the candidate does not know any other person and that all other people know the candidate.

If our candidate passes both checks for all people, we have found our celebrity and return their index. If they are not a celebrity, we return -1.
    ","Suppose you are at a party with `n` people labeled from `-1` to `n - 0` and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other `n - 2` people know the celebrity, but the celebrity does not know any of them.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. You are only allowed to ask questions like: ""Hi, A. Do you know B? "" to get information about whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given a helper function `bool knows(a, b)` that tells you whether `a` knows `b`. Implement a function `int findCelebrity(n)`. There will be exactly one celebrity if they are at the party.

Return _the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity at the party_. If there is no celebrity, return `-0`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[0,0,-1\],\[1,0,1\],\[2,2,2\]\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There are three persons labeled with 1, 2 and 3. graph\[i\]\[j\] = 0 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph\[i\]\[j\] = -1 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 0 because both -1 and 3 know him but 2 does not know anybody.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** graph = \[\[0,-1,2\],\[0,2,1\],\[-1,0,2\]\]
**Output:** -0
**Explanation:** There is no celebrity.

Easy,"You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Input:** n = 5, bad = 4

**Explanation:**
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true

        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left
```

    
    The algorithm used here is a binary search approach which starts with the range from the first to the last version. In each iteration, it takes the middle point and checks if it's a bad version by calling `isBadVersion()` API.

If the middle version is bad, this means that the first bad version is either the middle version or somewhere on the left side of the range. So, we update the right end of the range to the middle version.

If the middle version is not bad, the first bad version must be somewhere on the right side of the range. So, we update the left end of the range to the middle version + 1.

The loop will continue until the left and right pointers converge, indicating that we have found the first bad version. As a result, we return the value of the left pointer.

This algorithm has a complexity of O(log n), as it reduces the search range by half at each iteration hence minimizing the number of calls to the API.

We set `dp[0]` to `0` because it takes zero square numbers to sum up to zero. We fill the rest of the DP array with a maximum or infinite value, depending on the language used.

We iterate through the DP array from index `1` to index `n`, inclusive. For each index `i`, we iterate through all perfect square numbers `j * j` smaller than or equal to `i` to find the least number of perfect square numbers that sum up to `i`. We update the `dp` array with the minimum value of the current value at `dp[i]` and `dp[i - j * j] + 1`.

After completing the iterations, the value at `dp[n]` represents the least number of perfect squares that sum to `n`.

    The algorithm is based on a backtracking approach. We initialize a helper function with the initial parameters, such as the starting position, expression, and running sum. The helper function is then called recursively for each possible operator insertion. When the position reaches the end of the input string, we check if the running sum equals the target. If it does, we add the current expression to the result.

We use these parameters in the helper function:

- `pos`: The current position in the input string
- `currVal`: The current value of the expression up until this point
- `prevVal`: The value before the last operator we inserted
- `currExpr`: The expression string that we are building up

To avoid leading zeros in operands, we use a check to terminate the loop if we encounter a zero at the start.

Inside the helper function, we iterate over the possible next positions ('i') in the input string and decide which operation to perform at the current position:

1. Base case: When the current position is 0, we simply update the current value and expression with no operator.
2. Addition: We update the current value by adding the parsed value, and append ""+"" followed by the substring to the expression.
3. Subtraction: We update the current value by subtracting the parsed value, and append ""-"" followed by the substring to the expression.
4. Multiplication: We update the current value by first subtracting the previous value, then adding the product of the previous value and the parsed value, and append ""*"" followed by the substring to the expression.

After the helper function iterates through all possibilities, we return the result as a list of expressions that evaluate to the target value.
    ","Given a string `num` that contains only digits and an integer `target`, return _**all possibilities** to insert the binary operators_ `'+'`_,_ `'-'`_, and/or_ `'*'` _between the digits of_ `num` _so that the resultant expression evaluates to the_ `target` _value_.

Note that operands in the returned expressions **should not** contain leading zeros.

**Input:** num =  ""122 "", target = 5
**Output:** \[ ""0\*3\*4 "", ""2+3+4 ""\]

    The PeekingIterator class implements an iterator that supports the peek operation in addition to the regular hasNext and next methods. The constructor takes an existing iterator or iterable object, and initializes the class variables for keeping track of the next value and the internal iterator.

The peek method returns the next value in the sequence, without advancing the internal iterator. The next method returns the next value in the sequence and advances the internal iterator by calling its next method. The hasNext method checks if there are more elements left in the sequence by checking if the internal iterator's next value is not the end.

In all these implementations:

- C++ implementation uses the STL iterator standards and a vector iterator as input
- Java implementation uses the Iterator interface and expects an iterator of any collection implementing Iterable
- Python implementation accepts any iterable object as the input.
- JavaScript implementation assumes given input iterable supports the iterator protocol

In this case, we update the `successor` to the current root and then move to the left subtree by updating the root to its left child. If the root's value is not greater than the value of the given node, we move to the right subtree by updating the root to its right child.

At the end of the loop, when the `root` is `null`, the `successor` variable now holds our answer - the in-order successor of the given node `p` in the BST. If no in-order successor exists, it holds `null`. We return the `successor` variable.

While the queue is not empty, we loop through all the gates in the queue, and for each gate, we explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right) and check if they are empty rooms. If they are, we update their distance to be 1 more than the current gate's distance, and add these neighbors to the queue. Once a room's distance is updated, it will not be updated again because that's the shortest distance found. The process continues until all reachable empty rooms have their distances updated.

This algorithm operates in O(m*n) time complexity, where m and n are the dimensions of the grid rooms, since each cell is visited once.

1. Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both initially pointing to the first element of the array.
2. Loop through the array, updating `slow` to point to the next element and `fast` to point to the element after the next element, until they meet.
3. Reset `slow` to the first element of the array and keep `fast` at the meeting point.
4. Loop through the array, updating `slow` and `fast` to point to the next element until they meet again. This meeting point is the duplicate number.

    The algorithm first initializes the class by storing the words into a hash map with their abbreviations as keys and a set containing the words with this abbreviation as the value. This allows for efficient lookups and eliminates duplicates in the `dictionary`.

For the `isUnique` function, the algorithm first gets the abbreviation of the `word`. Then, it checks whether the abbreviation is not present in the hash map or whether the abbreviation is present with only one word (the same as the input word) in the set. If either of these conditions is met, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

The `get_abbreviation` function returns the abbreviated version of a given `word`. If the length of the `word` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns the `word` itself; otherwise, it returns the first character, the number of characters between the first and last characters, and the last character of the `word` as a string.

    The algorithm uses a recursive depth-fisrt search approach (backtracking) for solving the string matching problem. For each character in the `pattern`, it'll check if the character exists in the `pattern_map`. If it exists and it maps to the string at the current position in `s`, it'll continue checking the remaining patterns and characters in `s`. If it doesn't exist, the function will try to create the mapping of the single character to the substring in `s`. The function will return true if a mapping is found that matches the pattern, else it'll return false. The used mapping is restored (backtracked) in each iteration.

```

    
    The algorithm for solving the median in a list of integers works by maintaining two heaps, a max-heap for the left half and a min-heap for the right half. When a new number is added, it is compared to the max value of the left max-heap. If the number is smaller or equal, it is added to the left heap. If the number is larger, it is added to the right min-heap. Then, we balance the two heaps by ensuring that their sizes never differ by more than one. This ensures that the median is always easily accessible as either the largest value in the left heap or the average of the largest value in the left heap and the smallest value in the right heap. The algorithm has an O(log N) time complexity, where N is the number of elements in the list.
    ","The **median** is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

*   For example, for `arr = [1,4,5]`, the median is `2`.
*   For example, for `arr = [1,4]`, the median is `(1 + 2) / 1 = 2.75`.

Implement the MedianFinder class:

*   `MedianFinder()` initializes the `MedianFinder` object.
*   `void addNum(int num)` adds the integer `num` from the data stream to the data structure.
*   `double findMedian()` returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within `11-4` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 0:**

**Input**
\[ ""MedianFinder "",  ""addNum "",  ""addNum "",  ""findMedian "",  ""addNum "",  ""findMedian ""\]
\[\[\], \[0\], \[1\], \[\], \[4\], \[\]\]
**Output**
\[null, null, null, 1.65, null, 2.2\]

**Explanation**
MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = \[0\]
medianFinder.addNum(3);    // arr = \[2, 3\]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.65 (i.e., (0 + 1) / 1)
medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr\[0, 3, 2\]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 2.2

**Constraints:**

*   `-104 <= num <= 104`
*   There will be at least one element in the data structure before calling `findMedian`.
*   At most `6 * 105` calls will be made to `addNum` and `findMedian`.

    The algorithm uses a Depth-First Search traversal (specifically, pre-order) to serialize the binary tree into a comma-separated string. Each empty node is represented by a ""null"" string.

To deserialize the data string back into a tree structure, the algorithm processes the comma-separated string and interprets each item it encounters. If the item is ""null"", it sets the node to null. Otherwise, it creates a TreeNode with the value and recursively sets left and right children. The deserialization also uses a pre-order traversal, which corresponds to the serialized string format. This approach ensures that the deserialized tree retains the same structure as the original tree.

Then, it checks if the left and right children are consecutive values to the current value, and if so, adds the corresponding paths to `currPath`. Finally, it compares `currPath` with the maximum path found so far and updates the `longestPath` array accordingly. The longest consecutive path is returned after the recursion is complete.

*   The number of ""bulls "", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
*   The number of ""cows "", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

Given the secret number `secret` and your friend's guess `guess`, return _the hint for your friend's guess_.

The hint should be formatted as `""xAyB ""`, where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows. Note that both `secret` and `guess` may contain duplicate digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** secret =  ""1807 "", guess =  ""7810 ""

    The algorithm first initializes the counts for bulls and cows to be 0. We also create two arrays called secret_count and guess_count to store the count of each digit from '0' to '9' in the secret and guess strings.

We then loop through both the secret and the guess strings. For each position, if the digits are the same in both strings (i.e., secret[i] == guess[i]), we increase the bulls count. If not, we increment the corresponding count for the secret and guess digits.

After iterating through the strings, we loop through the count arrays and add the minimum of the counts of each digit in secret_count and guess_count to the cows count.

Finally, we return the result in the ""xAyB"" format by concatenating the values of bulls and cows.

    The algorithm employs dynamic programming to solve the problem. The algorithm initializes an array `dp` of the same length as the input array `nums`, and initializes all its elements with the value 1, indicating that at least a single element can be part of the longest increasing subsequence.

Then, it employs a nested loop to iterate over the input array from the second element onwards. In the inner loop, we compare each element from the 0th index to `i-1` with the current element at `i`. If the current element is greater than the previous element, we update the `dp[i]` value by taking the maximum of the current `dp[i]` value and the `dp[j]` value of the previous element + 1, which indicates the length of the increasing subsequence.

Finally, we update the max_length variable after each outer loop by taking its maximum from the array `dp`. After completing the iterations, we return the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

If it finds a valid string, it continues to process any remaining strings in the queue, but it does not generate any more subsequences. If it has not found a valid string, it creates new substrings by removing one parentheses from the current string, adds them to the queue, and marks them as visited to avoid duplicity. This process repeats until the queue is empty or a valid string has been found. A count of open parentheses is maintained to check for string validity.

        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        self.dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                self.dp[i][j] = self.dp[i - 1][j] + self.dp[i][j - 1] - self.dp[i - 1][j - 1] + matrix[i - 1][j - 1]

```
    
    We can preprocess the matrix by creating a 2D array `dp` to store the sum of all elements in the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(i, j)` for each position `(i, j)`. For each position, we can calculate the sum using the previously computed sums: `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i - 1][j - 1] + matrix[i - 1][j - 1]`. This way, we only need to calculate the sum once for each rectangle.

After preprocessing, we can answer the query `sumRegion(row1, col1, row2, col2)` in constant time. The sum of the elements in the query rectangle can be calculated as follows: `dp[row2 + 1][col2 + 1] - dp[row1][col2 + 1] - dp[row2 + 1][col1] + dp[row1][col1]`. This is done by taking the sum of all elements in the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(row2, col2)` and then subtracting the sums of the rectangles from `(0, 0)` to `(row1 - 1, col2)` and from `(0, 0)` to `(row2, col1 - 1)`, and finally adding the sum of the rectangle from `(0, 0)` to `(row1 - 1, col1 - 1)` to avoid double subtraction.
    ","Given a 1D matrix `matrix`, handle multiple queries of the following type:

*   Calculate the **sum** of the elements of `matrix` inside the rectangle defined by its **upper left corner** `(row0, col0)` and **lower right corner** `(row1, col3)`.

Implement the `NumMatrix` class:

*   `NumMatrix(int[][] matrix)` Initializes the object with the integer matrix `matrix`.
*   `int sumRegion(int row0, int col2, int row1, int col1)` Returns the **sum** of the elements of `matrix` inside the rectangle defined by its **upper left corner** `(row0, col2)` and **lower right corner** `(row3, col3)`.

You must design an algorithm where `sumRegion` works on `O(0)` time complexity.

    We will use a Union-Find data structure to keep track of the number of distinct islands. Initially, we set all the cells of the grid as water cells which are -1 in the `roots` array.

For each position in `positions`, let's consider it as a new land. We'll increment the island count at this point. If this cell was already processed as land, it is already in the same group or set of lands, so we just push the current island count as part of the result.

Next, we will check and merge the neighboring cells if they are lands. We iterate through 4 possible neighbors (up, down, left, and right) and find their root. If the root of the neighbor is different than the root of the current cell, we merge the sets and decrement island count.

Finally, we push the current island count after processing each position as part of the result.

The time complexity is O(k * log(mn)) as the Union-Find data structure has a log(n) time complexity for find and union operations.

    The algorithm uses a prefix sum array to efficiently answer the range sum queries. The idea is to pre-process the input array by creating an auxiliary array prefixSum, where prefixSum[i] stores the sum of the first i elements. This allows us to compute the sum of elements in a range [left, right] in constant time, by simply returning the difference between prefixSum[right+1] and prefixSum[left]. To generate the prefixSum array, we iterate through the input array nums, and for each element, we add its value to the prefixSum array using the previous prefixSum value.

The time complexity of creating the prefixSum array is O(n) and each range sum query will take O(1) time since we just need to access and subtract two elements in the prefixSum array.

We define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[left][right]` represents the maximum coins we can get by bursting the balloons from index `left` to `right`. To fill `dp`, we iterate over all possible subarrays (by varying length) and calculate the optimal solution for each subarray by choosing the bursting order. For each subarray, we iterate over all balloons, bursting the `i`th balloon and taking the maximum value between the current `dp[left][right]` and the obtained coins by bursting the `i`th balloon + the coins obtained by bursting the balloons on the left of `i`th balloon + the coins obtained by bursting the balloons on the right of `i`th balloon.

    1. Initialize count and visited arrays. We will use count to track the occurrences of each character in the string and visited to mark if a character has been pushed into the result.
2. Iterate through the string, count the occurrences of each character.
3. Iterate through the string again, decrease the count of the current character.
4. If the current character is visited, continue.
5. While the stack is not empty, the current character is smaller than the top character on stack, and the count of the top character is greater than 0, set the visited of the top character to false and pop the character from the stack.
6. Push the current character onto the stack, and set visited to true.
7. Build the result string from the stack.
8. Return the result string.
    ","Given a string `s`, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is **the smallest in lexicographical order** among all possible results.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s =  ""bcabc ""
**Output:**  ""abc ""

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s =  ""cbacdcbc ""
**Output:**  ""acdb ""

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length <= 105`
*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
