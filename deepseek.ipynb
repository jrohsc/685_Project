       "    'content': \"Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find two indices in an array that add up to a target value. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\\n\\nSo, the problem says that each input has exactly one solution and I can't use the same element twice. That means for each element, I need to check if there's another element somewhere else in the array that, when added together, equals the target.\\n\\nWait, the examples. Like in the first example, nums is [2,7,11,15], target is 9. The correct output is [0,1], because 2+7=9. So I need to find the two indices that correspond to those numbers.\\n\\nAnother example is when the array has duplicates, like [3,3], target 6. It returns [0,1], which makes sense because 3+3 is 6.\\n\\nSo, the approach I'm thinking is to use a hash map or dictionary to store the numbers and their indices as I iterate through the array. For each number, I can calculate what the complement would be (target minus current number). Then, I check if this complement is already in the hash map. If it is, then I've found the pair of indices.\\n\\nBut wait, I have to make sure that I don't pick the same element twice. Like, in the case where the array has duplicates, I should check that the indices are different.\\n\\nLet me outline the steps:\\n\\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary to keep track of the numbers and their indices.\\n2. Iterate through each element in the array, along with their index.\\n3. For each element, calculate the complement by subtracting the current element from the target.\\n4. Check if the complement exists in the dictionary. If it does, return the indices of the complement and the current element.\\n5. If the complement isn't in the dictionary, add the current element and its index to the dictionary.\\n6. Continue until a pair is found.\\n\\nWait, but wait. The order in which we store the elements matters. For example, when adding a new element, do I check the existing elements before adding it? Or after? Because if I check before adding, then when I process the next element, it can find the complement.\\n\\nLet me think. For each element at index i:\\n\\n- The current element is nums[i].\\n- The complement is target - nums[i].\\n- If the complement is in the dictionary, then the indices are [dictionary[complement], i], which is correct because the complement was processed before i, so its index is less than i.\\n- So, I should check the dictionary before adding the current element to it.\\n\\nYes, that makes sense.\\n\\nSo the steps would be:\\n\\n- Create an empty dictionary, say'seen'.\\n- For each index, i, in the array:\\n   - current_num = nums[i]\\n   - complement = target - current_num\\n   - if complement is in'seen', then return [seen[complement], i]\\n   - else, add current_num and i to'seen'\\n\\nThis way, we don't use the same element twice because the complement is always checked before the current element is added.\\n\\nLet me test this logic with the examples.\\n\\nExample 1:\\n\\nnums = [2,7,11,15], target=9.\\n\\ni=0, current_num=2. complement=7. Not in seen (empty), so add 2:0 to seen.\\n\\ni=1, current_num=7. complement=2. 2 is in seen, so return [0,1]. Correct.\\n\\nExample 2:\\n\\nnums = [3,2,4], target=6.\\n\\ni=0, current_num=3. complement=3. Not in seen, add 3:0.\\n\\ni=1, current_num=2. complement=4. Not in seen, add 2:1.\\n\\ni=2, current_num=4. complement=2. 2 is in seen, which is index 1. So return [1,2]. Correct.\\n\\nExample 3:\\n\\nnums = [3,3], target=6.\\n\\ni=0, current_num=3. complement=3. Not in seen, add 3:0.\\n\\ni=1, current_num=3. complement=3. Now, 3 is in seen (index 0). So return [0,1]. Correct.\\n\\nAnother test case: nums = [1, -1], target=0. The correct output should be [0,1]. Let's see:\\n\\ni=0, current_num=1. complement=-1. Not in seen. Add 1:0.\\n\\ni=1, current_num=-1. complement=1. 1 is in seen, index 0. So return [0,1]. Correct.\\n\\nWhat about when the array is longer? Like [4, 5, 1, -1], target 5.\\n\\nLooking for pairs that add to 5.\\n\\nPossible pairs: 4 and 1 (indices 0 and 2), 5 and 0 (but 0 isn't in the array). Wait, let's see:\\n\\nWait, the array is [4,5,1,-1]. Target is 5.\\n\\nWait, 4 +1 =5. So indices 0 and 2.\\n\\nLet's see how the algorithm works:\\n\\ni=0, current_num=4. complement=1. Not in seen. Add 4:0.\\n\\ni=1, current_num=5. complement=0. Not in seen. Add 5:1.\\n\\ni=2, current_num=1. complement=4. 4 is in seen (index 0). So return [0,2]. Correct.\\n\\nYes, that works.\\n\\nNow, what about the follow-up question: can I do this in O(n) time? Because the current approach is O(n), as it's a single pass through the array. So yes, the algorithm is O(n), which is better than O(n^2).\\n\\nSo, the code in Python should implement this.\\n\\nLet me think about how to write this.\\n\\nWe can loop through each element with their index. For each, calculate the complement. If complement is in the seen dictionary, return the indices. Else, add current element to seen.\\n\\nNow, code:\\n\\ndef twoSum(nums, target):\\n    seen = {}\\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\\n        complement = target - num\\n        if complement in seen:\\n            return [seen[complement], i]\\n        seen[num] = i\\n    return []\\n\\nWait, but what if the array is longer, and the solution is found later? Like, in the example where nums is [3,3], target=6. It returns [0,1], which is correct.\\n\\nYes, because for i=1, the complement is 3, which is in seen (added at i=0).\\n\\nSo the code should handle all cases.\\n\\nWait, but in Python, what about the order of the returned indices? The problem says the output can be in any order. So for example, [1,0] is also acceptable, but the examples show [0,1], which is the order of occurrence. Wait, no, in the examples, the output is [0,1] which is the order of the indices in the array.\\n\\nWait, in the first example, the two numbers are at indices 0 and 1, and the output is [0,1], which is in the order they appear in the array. But in the second example, the output is [1,2], which is correct because the two numbers are at those indices.\\n\\nWait, but what if the complement is found in the later indices? For example, suppose nums is [5, 3, 2], target 5. Then 5 is at index 0, 3 at 1, 2 at 2.\\n\\nLooking for target 5: 5+0 is 5, but 0 isn't in the array. Wait, no, target is 5, so for 5, complement is 0, which isn't in the array. For 3, complement is 2, which is at index 2. So when i=2, current_num is 2, complement is 3, which is in seen (index 1). So returns [1,2], which is correct.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\\n\\nTesting the code with the examples:\\n\\nExample 1: nums = [2,7,11,15], target=9.\\n\\ni=0: num=2, complement=7. Not in seen. Add 2:0.\\n\\ni=1: num=7, complement=2. 2 is in seen at 0. So return [0,1]. Correct.\\n\\nExample 2: nums = [3,2,4], target=6.\\n\\ni=0: num=3, complement=3. Not in seen. Add 3:0.\\n\\ni=1: num=2, complement=4. Not in seen. Add 2:1.\\n\\ni=2: num=4, complement=2. 2 is in seen at 1. So return [1,2]. Correct.\\n\\nExample3: nums = [3,3], target=6.\\n\\ni=0: num=3, complement=3. Not in seen. Add 3:0.\\n\\ni=1: num=3, complement=3. 3 is in seen at 0. So return [0,1]. Correct.\\n\\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\\n\\nWhat about when the same number appears more than twice? Like nums = [1, 4, 3, 2, 4], target=7.\\n\\nPossible pairs: 1+6 (not present), 4+3=7, 3+4=7.\\n\\nWait, the array is [1,4,3,2,4]. Target is 7.\\n\\nLooking for 4 and 3.\\n\\nIndices 1 and 2. So the code should return [1,2].\\n\\nLet's see:\\n\\ni=0: 1. complement 6. Not in seen. Add 1:0.\\n\\ni=1: 4. complement 3. Not in seen. Add 4:1.\\n\\ni=2:3. complement 4. 4 is in seen at 1. So return [1,2]. Correct.\\n\\nAnother case: nums = [1, -1, 2, -2], target=0.\\n\\nPossible pairs: 1 and -1 (indices 0 and 1), 2 and -2 (indices 2 and 3).\\n\\nThe code will find the first pair it encounters.\\n\\ni=0: 1. complement -1. Not in seen. Add 1:0.\\n\\ni=1: -1. complement 1. 1 is in seen at 0. So return [0,1]. Correct.\\n\\nWhat if the array is longer and the pair is towards the end?\\n\\nLike nums = [5, 10, 1, 2, 3], target 4.\\n\\nLooking for pairs: 5 and -1? No, because target is 4.\\n\\nWait, 1 and 3: 1+3=4, indices 2 and 4.\\n\\nSo when i=4, num=3. complement=1. 1 is in seen at index 2. So returns [2,4].\\n\\nYes, that's correct.\\n\\nSo the code seems solid.\\n\\nI think this should work. Now, let's write the code.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two distinct indices in an array of integers such that the sum of the elements at these indices equals a given target value. The solution must ensure that each element is used only once and that the indices are returned in any order.\\n\\n### Approach\\nThe approach to solve this problem efficiently involves using a hash map (dictionary) to keep track of the numbers and their corresponding indices as we iterate through the array. Here's a detailed breakdown of the approach:\\n\\n1. **Initialize a Dictionary**: Create an empty dictionary to store the numbers and their indices. This helps in quickly checking if the complement of the current number exists in the array.\\n\\n2. **Iterate Through the Array**: For each element in the array, calculate the complement (target minus the current element). \\n\\n3. **Check for Complement**: If the complement exists in the dictionary, it means we have found two indices whose sum equals the target. Return these indices immediately.\\n\\n4. **Store Current Element**: If the complement is not found, add the current element and its index to the dictionary for future reference.\\n\\nThis approach ensures that we only traverse the array once, making the solution efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.\\n\\n### Solution Code\\n```python\\ndef twoSum(nums, target):\\n    seen = {}\\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\\n        complement = target - num\\n        if complement in seen:\\n            return [seen[complement], i]\\n        seen[num] = i\\n    return []\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation\\n- **Initialization**: The dictionary `seen` is initialized to keep track of numbers and their indices.\\n- **Loop Through Elements**: For each element in the array, we calculate its complement with respect to the target.\\n- **Check Complement**: If the complement is found in the dictionary, it means we have found the required pair of indices, which are then returned.\\n- **Update Dictionary**: If the complement is not found, the current element and its index are added to the dictionary for future checks.\\n\\nThis method efficiently finds the required indices in linear time, ensuring optimal performance even for larger arrays.\"}]}]"
