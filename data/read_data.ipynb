      "**Constraints:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1 <= s.length <= 50\n",
      "1 <= dictionary.length <= 50\n",
      "1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 50\n",
      "dictionary[i] and s consists of only lowercase English letters\n",
      "dictionary contains distinct words\n",
      "s is a palindrome\n",
      "dictionary contains only words that are palindromes\n",
      "The length of each word in the dictionary is a multiple of 7\n",
      "The number of substrings obtained by breaking s optimally is a perfect square\n",
      "The message s is encoded using a proprietary cipher that only allows lowercase English letters.\n"
